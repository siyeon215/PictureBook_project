the light princess   contents     1  what no children    2  won't i just    3  she can't be ours    4  where is she    5  what is to be done    6  she laughs too much    7  try metaphysics    8  try a drop of water    9  put me in again   10  look at the moon   11  hiss   12  where is the prince   13  here i am   14  this is very kind of you   15  look at the rain     1  what no children   once upon a time so long ago that i have quite forgotten the date there lived a king and queen who had no children  and the king said to himself all the queens of my acquaintance have children some three some seven and some as many as twelve and my queen has not one  i feel ill-used  so he made up his mind to be cross with his wife about it  but she bore it all like a good patient queen as she was  then the king grew very cross indeed  but the queen pretended to take it all as a joke and a very good one too  why don't you have any daughters at least said he  i don't say sons that might be too much to expect  i am sure dear king i am very sorry said the queen  so you ought to be retorted the king you are not going to make a virtue of that surely  but he was not an ill-tempered king and in any matter of less moment would have let the queen have her own way with all his heart  this however was an affair of state  the queen smiled  you must have patience with a lady you know dear king said she  she was indeed a very nice queen and heartily sorry that she could not oblige the king immediately    2  won't i just  the king tried to have patience but he succeeded very badly  it was more than he deserved therefore when at last the queen gave him a daughter as lovely a little princess as ever cried  the day drew near when the infant must be christened  the king wrote all the invitations with his own hand  of course somebody was forgotten  now it does not generally matter if somebody is forgotten only you must mind who  unfortunately the king forgot without intending to forget and so the chance fell upon the princess makemnoit which was awkward  for the princess was the king's own sister and he ought not to have forgotten her  but she had made herself so disagreeable to the old king their father that he had forgotten her in making his will and so it was no wonder that her brother forgot her in writing his invitations  but poor relations don't do anything to keep you in mind of them  why don't they  the king could not see into the garret she lived in could he  she was a sour spiteful creature  the wrinkles of contempt crossed the wrinkles of peevishness and made her face as full of wrinkles as a pat of butter  if ever a king could be justified in forgetting anybody this king was justified in forgetting his sister even at a christening  she looked very odd too  her forehead was as large as all the rest of her face and projected over it like a precipice  when she was angry her little eyes flashed blue  when she hated anybody they shone yellow and green  what they looked like when she loved anybody i do not know for i never heard of her loving anybody but herself and i do not think she could have managed that if she had not somehow got used to herself  but what made it highly imprudent in the king to forget her was that she was awfully clever  in fact she was a witch and when she bewitched anybody he very soon had enough of it for she beat all the wicked fairies in wickedness and all the clever ones in cleverness  she despised all the modes we read of in history in which offended fairies and witches have taken their revenges and therefore after waiting and waiting in vain for an invitation she made up her mind at last to go without one and make the whole family miserable like a princess as she was  so she put on her best gown went to the palace was kindly received by the happy monarch who forgot that he had forgotten her and took her place in the procession to the royal chapel  when they were all gathered about the font she contrived to get next to it and throw something into the water after which she maintained a very respectful demeanour till the water was applied to the child's face  but at that moment she turned round in her place three times and muttered the following words loud enough for those beside her to hear      light of spirit by my charms   light of body every part   never weary human arms    only crush thy parents' heart   they all thought she had lost her wits and was repeating some foolish nursery rhyme but a shudder went through the whole of them notwithstanding  the baby on the contrary began to laugh and crow while the nurse gave a start and a smothered cry for she thought she was struck with paralysis  she could not feel the baby in her arms but she clasped it tight and said nothing  the mischief was done    3  she can't be ours  her atrocious aunt had deprived the child of all her gravity  if you ask me how this was effected i answer in the easiest way in the world  she had only to destroy gravitation  for the princess was a philosopher and knew all the ins and outs of the laws of gravitation as well as the ins and outs of her boot-lace  and being a witch as well she could abrogate those laws in a moment or at least so clog their wheels and rust their bearings that they would not work at all but we have more to do with what followed than with how it was done  the first awkwardness that resulted from this unhappy privation was that the moment the nurse began to float the baby up and down she flew from her arms towards the ceiling  happily the resistance of the air brought her ascending career to a close within a foot of it  there she remained horizontal as when she left her nurse's arms kicking and laughing amazingly  the nurse in terror flew to the bell and begged the footman who answered it to bring up the house-steps directly trembling in every limb she climbed upon the steps and had to stand upon the very top and reach up before she could catch the floating tail of the baby's long clothes  when the strange fact came to be known there was a terrible commotion in the palace  the occasion of its discovery by the king was naturally a repetition of the nurse's experience  astonished that he felt no weight when the child was laid in his arms he began to wave her up and not down for she slowly ascended to the ceiling as before and there remained floating in perfect comfort and satisfaction as was testified by her peals of tiny laughter  the king stood staring up in speechless amazement and trembled so that his beard shook like grass in the wind at last turning to the queen who was just as horror-struck as himself he said gasping staring and stammering   she can't be ours queen  now the queen was much cleverer than the king and had begun already to suspect that this effect defective came by cause  i am sure she is ours answered she  but we ought to have taken better care of her at the christening  people who were never invited ought not to have been present  oh ho said the king tapping his forehead with his forefinger i have it all  i've found her out  don't you see it queen  princess makemnoit has bewitched her that's just what i say answered the queen  i beg your pardon my love i did not hear you john bring the steps i get on my throne with  for he was a little king with a great throne like many other kings  the throne-steps were brought and set upon the dining-table and john got upon the top of them  but he could not reach the little princess who lay like a baby-laughter-cloud in the air exploding continuously take the tongs john said his majesty and getting up on the table he handed them to him  john could reach the baby now and the little princess was handed down by the tongs    4  where is she  one fine summer day a month after these her first adventures during which time she had been very carefully watched the princess was lying on the bed in the queen's own chamber fast asleep  one of the windows was open for it was noon and the day was so sultry that the little girl was wrapped in nothing less ethereal than slumber itself  the queen came into the room and not observing that the baby was on the bed opened another window  a frolicsome fairy wind which had been watching for a chance of mischief rushed in at the one window and taking its way over the bed where the child was lying caught her up and rolling and floating her along like a piece of flue or a dandelion seed carried her with it through the opposite window and away  the queen went down-stairs quite ignorant of the loss she had herself occasioned  when the nurse returned she supposed that her majesty had carried her off and dreading a scolding delayed making inquiry about her  but hearing nothing she grew uneasy and went at length to the queen's boudoir where she found her majesty  please your majesty shall i take the baby said she  where is she asked the queen  please forgive me  i know it was wrong  what do you mean said the queen looking grave  oh don't frighten me your majesty exclaimed the nurse clasping her hands  the queen saw that something was amiss and fell down in a faint  the nurse rushed about the palace screaming my baby my baby  every one ran to the queen's room  but the queen could give no orders they soon found out however that the princess was missing and in a moment the palace was like a beehive in a garden and in one minute more the queen was brought to herself by a great shout and a clapping of hands  they had found the princess fast asleep under a rose-bush to which the elvish little wind-puff had carried her finishing its mischief by shaking a shower of red rose-leaves all over the little white sleeper  startled by the noise the servants made she woke and furious with glee scattered the rose-leaves in all directions like a shower of spray in the sunset  she was watched more carefully after this no doubt yet it would be endless to relate all the odd incidents resulting from this peculiarity of the young princess  but there never was a baby in a house not to say a palace that kept the household in such constant good humour at least below-stairs  if it was not easy for her nurses to hold her at least she made neither their arms nor their hearts ache  and she was so nice to play at ball with  there was positively no danger of letting her fall  they might throw her down or knock her down or push her down but couldn't let her down  it is true they might let her fly into the fire or the coal-hole or through the window but none of these accidents had happened as yet  if you heard peals of laughter resounding from some unknown region you might be sure enough of the cause  going down into the kitchen or the room you would find jane and thomas and robert and susan all and sum playing at ball with the little princess  she was the ball herself and did not enjoy it the less for that  away she went flying from one to another screeching with laughter  and the servants loved the ball itself better even than the game  but they had to take some care how they threw her for if she received an upward direction she would never come down again without being fetched    5  what is to be done  but above-stairs it was different  one day for instance after breakfast the king went into his counting-house and counted out his money  the operation gave him no pleasure  to think said he to himself that every one of these gold sovereigns weighs a quarter of an ounce and my real live flesh-and-blood princess weighs nothing at all  and he hated his gold sovereigns as they lay with a broad smile of self-satisfaction all over their yellow faces  the queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey  but at the second mouthful she burst out crying and could not swallow it  the king heard her sobbing  glad of anybody but especially of his queen to quarrel with he clashed his gold sovereigns into his money-box clapped his crown on his head and rushed into the parlour  what is all this about exclaimed he  what are you crying for queen  i can't eat it said the queen looking ruefully at the honey-pot  no wonder retorted the king  you've just eaten your breakfast two turkey eggs and three anchovies  oh that's not it sobbed her majesty  it's my child my child  well what's the matter with your child  she's neither up the chimney nor down the draw-well  just hear her laughing  yet the king could not help a sigh which he tried to turn into a cough saying   it is a good thing to be light-hearted i am sure whether she be ours or not  it is a bad thing to be light-headed answered the queen looking with prophetic soul far into the future  'tis a good thing to be light-handed said the king  'tis a bad thing to be light-fingered answered the queen  'tis a good thing to be light-footed said the king  'tis a bad thing  began the queen but the king interrupted her  in fact said he with the tone of one who concludes an argument in which he has had only imaginary opponents and in which therefore he has come off triumphant in fact it is a good thing altogether to be light-bodied  but it is a bad thing altogether to be light-minded retorted the queen who was beginning to lose her temper  this last answer quite discomfited his majesty who turned on his heel and betook himself to his counting-house again  but he was not half-way towards it when the voice of his queen overtook him  and it's a bad thing to be light-haired screamed she determined to have more last words now that her spirit was roused  the queen's hair was black as night and the king's had been and his daughter's was golden as morning  but it was not this reflection on his hair that arrested him it was the double use of the word light for the king hated all witticisms and punning especially  and besides he could not tell whether the queen meant light-haired or light-heired for why might she not aspirate her vowels when she was exasperated herself  he turned upon his other heel and rejoined her  she looked angry still because she knew that she was guilty or what was much the same knew that he thought so  my dear queen said he duplicity of any sort is exceedingly objectionable between married people of any rank not to say kings and queens and the most objectionable form duplicity can assume is that of punning  there said the queen i never made a jest but i broke it in the making  i am the most unfortunate woman in the world  she looked so rueful that the king took her in his arms and they sat down to consult  can you bear this said the king  no i can't said the queen  well what's to be done said the king  i'm sure i don't know said the queen  but might you not try an apology  to my old sister i suppose you mean said the king  yes said the queen  well i don't mind said the king  so he went the next morning to the house of the princess and making a very humble apology begged her to undo the spell  but the princess declared with a grave face that she knew nothing at all about it her eyes however shone pink which was a sign that she was happy she advised the king and queen to have patience and to mend their ways  the king returned disconsolate  the queen tried to comfort him  we will wait till she is older  she may then be able to suggest something herself  she will know at least how she feels and explain things to us  but what if she should marry exclaimed the king in sudden consternation at the idea  well what of that rejoined the queen  just think  if she were to have children  in the course of a hundred years the air might be as full of floating children as of gossamers in autumn  that is no business of ours replied the queen  besides by that time they will have learned to take care of themselves  a sigh was the king's only answer  he would have consulted the court physicians but he was afraid they would try experiments upon her    6  she laughs too much  meantime notwithstanding awkward occurrences and griefs that she brought upon her parents the little princess laughed and grew not fat but plump and tall  she reached the age of seventeen without having fallen into any worse scrape than a chimney by rescuing her from which a little bird-nesting urchin got fame and a black face nor thoughtless as she was had she committed anything worse than laughter at everybody and everything that came in her way  when she was told for the sake of experiment that general clanrunfort was cut to pieces with all his troops she laughed when she heard that the enemy was on his way to besiege her papa's capital she laughed hugely but when she was told that the city would certainly be abandoned to the mercy of the enemy's soldiery why then she laughed immoderately  she never could be brought to see the serious side of anything  when her mother cried she said   what queer faces mamma makes  and she squeezes water out of her cheeks  funny mamma  and when her papa stormed at her she laughed and danced round and round him clapping her hands and crying   do it again papa  do it again  it's such fun  dear funny papa  and if he tried to catch her she glided from him in an instant not in the least afraid of him but thinking it part of the game not to be caught  with one push of her foot she would be floating in the air above his head or she would go dancing backwards and forwards and sideways like a great butterfly  it happened several times when her father and mother were holding a consultation about her in private that they were interrupted by vainly repressed outbursts of laughter over their heads and looking up with indignation saw her floating at full length in the air above them whence she regarded them with the most comical appreciation of the position  one day an awkward accident happened  the princess had come out upon the lawn with one of her attendants who held her by the hand  spying her father at the other side of the lawn she snatched her hand from the maid's and sped across to him  now when she wanted to run alone her custom was to catch up a stone in each hand so that she might come down again after a bound  whatever she wore as part of her attire had no effect in this way  even gold when it thus became as it were a part of herself lost all its weight for the time  but whatever she only held in her hands retained its downward tendency  on this occasion she could see nothing to catch up but a huge toad that was walking across the lawn as if he had a hundred years to do it in  not knowing what disgust meant for this was one of her peculiarities she snatched up the toad and bounded away  she had almost reached her father and he was holding out his arms to receive her and take from her lips the kiss which hovered on them like a butterfly on a rosebud when a puff of wind blew her aside into the arms of a young page who had just been receiving a message from his majesty  now it was no great peculiarity in the princess that once she was set agoing it always cost her time and trouble to check herself  on this occasion there was no time  she must kiss-and she kissed the page  she did not mind it much for she had no shyness in her composition and she knew besides that she could not help it  so she only laughed like a musical box  the poor page fared the worst  for the princess trying to correct the unfortunate tendency of the kiss put out her hands to keep her off the page so that along with the kiss he received on the other cheek a slap with the huge black toad which she poked right into his eye  he tried to laugh too but the attempt resulted in such an odd contortion of countenance as showed that there was no danger of his pluming himself on the kiss  as for the king his dignity was greatly hurt and he did not speak to the page for a whole month  i may here remark that it was very amusing to see her run if her mode of progression could properly be called running  for first she would make a bound then having alighted she would run a few steps and make another bound  sometimes she would fancy she had reached the ground before she actually had and her feet would go backwards and forwards running upon nothing at all like those of a chicken on its back  then she would laugh like the very spirit of fun only in her laugh there was something missing  what it was i find myself unable to describe  i think it was a certain tone depending upon the possibility of sorrow morbidezza perhaps  she never smiled    7  try metaphysics  after a long avoidance of the painful subject the king and queen resolved to hold a council of three upon it and so they sent for the princess  in she came sliding and flitting and gliding from one piece of furniture to another and put herself at last in an armchair in a sitting posture  whether she could be said to sit seeing she received no support from the seat of the chair i do not pretend to determine  my dear child said the king you must be aware by this time that you are not exactly like other people  oh you dear funny papa  i have got a nose and two eyes and all the rest  so have you  so has mamma  now be serious my dear for once said the queen  no thank you mamma i had rather not  would you not like to be able to walk like other people said the king  no indeed i should think not  you only crawl  you are such slow coaches  how do you feel my child he resumed after a pause of discomfiture  quite well thank you  i mean what do you feel like  like nothing at all that i know of  you must feel like something  i feel like a princess with such a funny papa and such a dear pet of a queen-mamma  now really began the queen but the princess interrupted her  oh yes she added i remember  i have a curious feeling sometimes as if i were the only person that had any sense in the whole world  she had been trying to behave herself with dignity but now she burst into a violent fit of laughter threw herself backwards over the chair and went rolling about the floor in an ecstasy of enjoyment  the king picked her up easier than one does a down quilt and replaced her in her former relation to the chair  the exact preposition expressing this relation i do not happen to know  is there nothing you wish for resumed the king who had learned by this time that it was useless to be angry with her  oh you dear papa yes answered she  what is it my darling  i have been longing for it oh such a time ever since last night tell me what it is  will you promise to let me have it  the king was on the point of saying yes but the wiser queen checked him with a single motion of her head  tell me what it is first said he  no no  promise first  i dare not  what is it  mind i hold you to your promise it is to be tied to the end of a string a very long string indeed and be flown like a kite  oh such fun  i would rain rose-water and hail sugar-plums and snow whipped-cream and and and   a fit of laughing checked her and she would have been off again over the floor had not the king started up and caught her just in time seeing nothing but talk could be got out of her he rang the bell and sent her away with two of her ladies-in-waiting  now queen he said turning to her majesty what is to be done  there is but one thing left answered she  let us consult the college of metaphysicians  bravo cried the king we will  now at the head of this college were two very wise chinese philosophers-by name hum-drum and kopy-keck  for them the king sent and straightway they came  in a long speech he communicated to them what they knew very well already as who did not namely the peculiar condition of his daughter in relation to the globe on which she dwelt and requested them to consult together as to what might be the cause and probable cure of her infirmity  the king laid stress upon the word but failed to discover his own pun  the queen laughed but hum-drum and kopy-keck heard with humility and retired in silence  the consultation consisted chiefly in propounding and supporting for the thousandth time each his favourite theories  for the condition of the princess afforded delightful scope for the discussion of every question arising from the division of thought-in fact of all the metaphysics of the chinese empire  but it is only justice to say that they did not altogether neglect the discussion of the practical question what was to be done  hum-drum was a materialist and kopy-keck was a spiritualist  the former was slow and sententious the latter was quick and flighty  the latter had generally the first word the former the last  i reassert my former assertion began kopy-keck with a plunge there is not a fault in the princess body or soul only they are wrong put together  listen to me now hum-drum and i will tell you in brief what i think  don't speak  don't answer me  i won't hear you till i have done   at that decisive moment when souls seek their appointed habitations two eager souls met struck rebounded lost their way and arrived each at the wrong place  the soul of the princess was one of those and she went far astray  she does not belong by rights to this world at all but to some other planet probably mercury  her proclivity to her true sphere destroys all the natural influence which this orb would otherwise possess over her corporeal frame  she cares for nothing here  there is no relation between her and this world  she must therefore be taught by the sternest compulsion to take an interest in the earth as the earth  she must study every department of its history its animal history its vegetable history its mineral history its social history its moral history its political history its scientific history its literary history its musical history its artistical history above all its metaphysical history  she must begin with the chinese dynasty and end with japan  but first of all she must study geology and especially the history of the extinct races of animals-their natures their habits their loves their hates their revenges  she must   hold h-o-o-old roared hum-drum  it is certainly my turn now  my rooted and insubvertible conviction is that the causes of the anomalies evident in the princess's condition are strictly and solely physical  but that is only tantamount to acknowledging that they exist  hear my opinion   from some cause or other of no importance to our inquiry the motion of her heart has been reversed  that remarkable combination of the suction and the force-pump works the wrong way-i mean in the case of the unfortunate princess  it draws in where it should force out and forces out where it should draw in  the offices of the auricles and the ventricles are subverted  the blood is sent forth by the veins and returns by the arteries  consequently it is running the wrong way through all her corporeal organism lungs and all  is it then at all mysterious seeing that such is the case that on the other particular of gravitation as well she should differ from normal humanity  my proposal for the cure is this    phlebotomize until she is reduced to the last point of safety  let it be effected if necessary in a warm bath  when she is reduced to a state of perfect asphyxy apply a ligature to the left ankle drawing it as tight as the bone will bear  apply at the same moment another of equal tension around the right wrist  by means of plates constructed for the purpose place the other foot and hand under the receivers of two air-pumps  exhaust the receivers  exhibit a pint of french brandy and await the result  which would presently arrive in the form of grim death said kopy-keck  if it should she would yet die in doing our duty retorted hum-drum  but their majesties had too much tenderness for their volatile offspring to subject her to either of the schemes of the equally unscrupulous philosophers  indeed the most complete knowledge of the laws of nature would have been unserviceable in her case for it was impossible to classify her  she was a fifth imponderable body sharing all the other properties of the ponderable    8  try a drop of water  perhaps the best thing for the princess would have been to fall in love  but how a princess who had no gravity could fall into anything is a difficulty perhaps the difficulty  as for her own feelings on the subject she did not even know that there was such a beehive of honey and stings to be fallen into  but now i come to mention another curious fact about her  the palace was built on the shores of the loveliest lake in the world and the princess loved this lake more than father or mother  the root of this preference no doubt although the princess did not recognise it as such was that the moment she got into it she recovered the natural right of which she had been so wickedly deprived namely gravity  whether this was owing to the fact that water had been employed as the means of conveying the injury i do not know  but it is certain that she could swim and dive like the duck that her old nurse said she was  the manner in which this alleviation of her misfortune was discovered was as follows  one summer evening during the carnival of the country she had been taken upon the lake by the king and queen in the royal barge  they were accompanied by many of the courtiers in a fleet of little boats in the middle of the lake she wanted to get into the lord chancellor's barge for his daughter who was a great favourite with her was in it with her father  now though the old king rarely condescended to make light of his misfortune yet happening on this occasion to be in a particularly good humour as the barges approached each other he caught up the princess to throw her into the chancellor's barge  he lost his balance however and dropping into the bottom of the barge lost his hold of his daughter not however before imparting to her the downward tendency of his own person though in a somewhat different direction for as the king fell into the boat she fell into the water  with a burst of delighted laughter she disappeared in the lake a cry of horror ascended from the boats  they had never seen the princess go down before  half the men were under water in a moment but they had all one after another come up to the surface again for breath when tinkle tinkle babble and gush came the princess's laugh over the water from far away  there she was swimming like a swan  nor would she come out for king or queen chancellor or daughter  she was perfectly obstinate  but at the same time she seemed more sedate than usual  perhaps that was because a great pleasure spoils laughing  at all events after this the passion of her life was to get into the water and she was always the better behaved and the more beautiful the more she had of it  summer and winter it was quite the same only she could not stay so long in the water when they had to break the ice to let her in  any day from morning till evening in summer she might be descried a streak of white in the blue water lying as still as the shadow of a cloud or shooting along like a dolphin disappearing and coming up again far off just where one did not expect her  she would have been in the lake of a night too if she could have had her way for the balcony of her window overhung a deep pool in it and through a shallow reedy passage she could have swum out into the wide wet water and no one would have been any the wiser  indeed when she happened to wake in the moonlight she could hardly resist the temptation  but there was the sad difficulty of getting into it  she had as great a dread of the air as some children have of the water  for the slightest gust of wind would blow her away and a gust might arise in the stillest moment and if she gave herself a push towards the water and just failed of reaching it her situation would be dreadfully awkward irrespective of the wind for at best there she would have to remain suspended in her nightgown till she was seen and angled for by someone from the window  oh if i had my gravity thought she contemplating the water i would flash off this balcony like a long white sea-bird headlong into the darling wetness  heigh-ho  this was the only consideration that made her wish to be like other people  another reason for her being fond of the water was that in it alone she enjoyed any freedom  for she could not walk out without a cortege consisting in part of a troop of light horse for fear of the liberties which the wind might take with her  and the king grew more apprehensive with increasing years till at last he would not allow her to walk abroad at all without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many parts of her dress and held by twenty noblemen  of course horseback was out of the question  but she bade good-by to all this ceremony when she got into the water  and so remarkable were its effects upon her especially in restoring her for the time to the ordinary human gravity that hum-drum and kopy-keck agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three years in the hope that as the water did her so much good the earth would do her yet more  but the king had some vulgar prejudices against the experiment and would not give his consent  foiled in this they yet agreed in another recommendation which seeing that one imported his opinions from china and the other from thibet was very remarkable indeed  they argued that if water of external origin and application could be so efficacious water from a deeper source might work a perfect cure in short that if the poor afflicted princess could by any means be made to cry she might recover her lost gravity  but how was this to be brought about  therein lay all the difficulty to meet which the philosophers were not wise enough  to make the princess cry was as impossible as to make her weigh  they sent for a professional beggar commanded him to prepare his most touching oracle of woe helped him out of the court charade box to whatever he wanted for dressing up and promised great rewards in the event of his success  but it was all in vain  she listened to the mendicant artist's story and gazed at his marvellous make up till she could contain herself no longer and went into the most undignified contortions for relief shrieking positively screeching with laughter  when she had a little recovered herself she ordered her attendants to drive him away and not give him a single copper whereupon his look of mortified discomfiture wrought her punishment and his revenge for it sent her into violent hysterics from which she was with difficulty recovered  but so anxious was the king that the suggestion should have a fair trial that he put himself in a rage one day and rushing up to her room gave her an awful whipping  yet not a tear would flow  she looked grave and her laughing sounded uncommonly like screaming that was all  the good old tyrant though he put on his best gold spectacles to look could not discover the smallest cloud in the serene blue of her eyes    9  put me in again  it must have been about this time that the son of a king who lived a thousand miles from lagobel set out to look for the daughter of a queen  he travelled far and wide but as sure as he found a princess he found some fault in her  of course he could not marry a mere woman however beautiful and there was no princess to be found worthy of him whether the prince was so near perfection that he had a right to demand perfection itself i cannot pretend to say  all i know is that he was a fine handsome brave generous well-bred and well-behaved youth as all princes are  in his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess but as everybody said she was bewitched he never dreamed that she could bewitch him  for what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity  who could tell what she might not lose next  she might lose her visibility or her tangibility or in short the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium so that he should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive  of course he made no further inquiries about her  one day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest  these forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers like a sieve that keeps back the bran then the princes get away to follow their fortunes  in this way they have the advantage of the princesses who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun  i wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes  one lovely evening after wandering about for many days he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them and he soon came upon a kind of heath  next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood but by this time it was getting late and there was nobody in the fields to direct him  after travelling for another hour his horse quite worn out with long labour and lack of food fell and was unable to rise again  so he continued his journey on foot  at length he entered another wood not a wild forest but a civilized wood through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake  along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness  suddenly he paused and listened strange sounds came across the water  it was in fact the princess laughing  now there was something odd in her laugh as i have already hinted for the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming  looking over the lake he saw something white in the water and in an instant he had torn off his tunic kicked off his sandals and plunged in  he soon reached the white object and found that it was a woman  there was not light enough to show that she was a princess but quite enough to show that she was a lady for it does not want much light to see that  now i cannot tell how it came about whether she pretended to be drowning or whether he frightened her or caught her so as to embarrass her but certainly he brought her to shore in a fashion ignominious to a swimmer and more nearly drowned than she had ever expected to be for the water had got into her throat as often as she had tried to speak  at the place to which he bore her the bank was only a foot or two above the water so he gave her a strong lift out of the water to lay her on the bank  but her gravitation ceasing the moment she left the water away she went up into the air scolding and screaming  you naughty naughty naughty naughty man she cried  no one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before when the prince saw her ascend he thought he must have been bewitched and have mistaken a great swan for a lady  but the princess caught hold of the topmost cone upon a lofty fir  this came off but she caught at another and in fact stopped herself by gathering cones dropping them as the stalks gave way  the prince meantime stood in the water staring and forgetting to get out  but the princess disappearing he scrambled on shore and went in the direction of the tree  there he found her climbing down one of the branches towards the stem  but in the darkness of the wood the prince continued in some bewilderment as to what the phenomenon could be until reaching the ground and seeing him standing there she caught hold of him and said   i'll tell papa  oh no you won't returned the prince  yes i will she persisted  what business had you to pull me down out of the water and throw me to the bottom of the air  i never did you any harm  pardon me  i did not mean to hurt you  i don't believe you have any brains and that is a worse loss than your wretched gravity  i pity you  the prince now saw that he had come upon the bewitched princess and had already offended her  but before he could think what to say next she burst out angrily giving a stamp with her foot that would have sent her aloft again but for the hold she had of his arm   put me up directly  put you up where you beauty asked the prince  he had fallen in love with her almost already for her anger made her more charming than any one else had ever beheld her and as far as he could see which certainly was not far she had not a single fault about her except of course that she had not any gravity  no prince however would judge of a princess by weight  the loveliness of her foot he would hardly estimate by the depth of the impression it could make in mud  put you up where you beauty asked the prince  in the water you stupid answered the princess  come then said the prince  the condition of her dress increasing her usual difficulty in walking compelled her to cling to him and he could hardly persuade himself that he was not in a delightful dream notwithstanding the torrent of musical abuse with which she overwhelmed him  the prince being therefore in no hurry they came upon the lake at quite another part where the bank was twenty-five feet high at least and when they had reached the edge he turned towards the princess and said   how am i to put you in that is your business she answered quite snappishly  you took me out put me in again  very well said the prince and catching her up in his arms he sprang with her from the rock  the princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them  when they came to the surface she found that for a moment or two she could not even laugh for she had gone down with such a rush that it was with difficulty she recovered her breath  the instant they reached the surface   how do you like falling in said the prince  after some effort the princess panted out   is that what you call falling in  yes answered the prince i should think it a very tolerable specimen  it seemed to me like going up rejoined she  my feeling was certainly one of elevation too the prince conceded  the princess did not appear to understand him for she retorted his question    how do you like falling in said the princess  beyond everything answered he for i have fallen in with the only perfect creature i ever saw  no more of that  i am tired of it said the princess  perhaps she shared her father's aversion to punning  don't you like falling in then said the prince  it is the most delightful fun i ever had in my life answered she i never fell before  i wish i could learn  to think i am the only person in my father's kingdom that can't fall  here the poor princess looked almost sad  i shall be most happy to fall in with you any time you like said the prince devotedly  thank you  i don't know  perhaps it would not be proper  but i don't care  at all events as we have fallen in let us have a swim together  with all my heart responded the prince  and away they went swimming and diving and floating until at last they heard cries along the shore and saw lights glancing in all directions  it was now quite late and there was no moon  i must go home said the princess  i am very sorry for this is delightful  so am i returned the prince  but i am glad i haven't a home to go to at least i don't exactly know where it is  i wish i hadn't one either rejoined the princess it is so stupid i have a great mind she continued to play them all a trick  why couldn't they leave me alone  they won't trust me in the lake for a single night you see where that green light is burning  that is the window of my room  now if you would just swim there with me very quietly and when we are all but under the balcony give me such a push up you call it-as you did a little while ago i should be able to catch hold of the balcony and get in at the window and then they may look for me till to-morrow morning  with more obedience than pleasure said the prince gallantly and away they swam very gently  will you be in the lake to-morrow night the prince ventured to ask  to be sure i will  i don't think so  perhaps was the princess's somewhat strange answer  but the prince was intelligent enough not to press her further and merely whispered as he gave her the parting lift don't tell  the only answer the princess returned was a roguish look  she was already a yard above his head  the look seemed to say never fear it is too good fun to spoil that way  so perfectly like other people had she been in the water that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly grasp the balcony and disappear through the window  he turned almost expecting to see her still by his side  but he was alone in the water  so he swam away quietly and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber  as soon as they disappeared he landed in search of his tunic and sword and after some trouble found them again  then he made the best of his way round the lake to the other side  there the wood was wilder and the shore steeper-rising more immediately towards the mountains which surrounded the lake on all sides and kept sending it messages of silvery streams from morning to night and all night long he soon found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess's room and where even in the broad daylight he would be in no danger of being discovered from the opposite shore  it was a sort of cave in the rock where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves and lay down too tired for hunger to keep him awake  all night long he dreamed that he was swimming with the princess    10  look at the moon  early the next morning the prince set out to look for something to eat which he soon found at a forester's hut where for many following days he was supplied with all that a brave prince could consider necessary and having plenty to keep him alive for the present he would not think of wants not yet in existence  whenever care intruded this prince always bowed him out in the most princely manner  when he returned from his breakfast to his watch-cave he saw the princess already floating about in the lake attended by the king and queen whom he knew by their crowns and a great company in lovely little boats with canopies of all the colours of the rainbow and flags and streamers of a great many more  it was a very bright day and soon the prince burned up with the heat began to long for the cold water and the cool princess  but he had to endure till twilight for the boats had provisions on board and it was not till the sun went down that the gay party began to vanish  boat after boat drew away to the shore following that of the king and queen till only one apparently the princess's own boat remained  but she did not want to go home even yet and the prince thought he saw her order the boat to the shore without her  at all events it rowed away and now of all the radiant company only one white speck remained  then the prince began to sing and this is what he sung      lady fair   swan-white   lift thine eyes   banish night   by the might   of thine eyes    snowy arms   oars of snow   oar her hither   plashing low   soft and slow   oar her hither    stream behind her   o'er the lake   radiant whiteness   in her wake   following following for her sake   radiant whiteness    cling about her   waters blue   part not from her   but renew   cold and true   kisses round her    lap me round   waters sad   that have left her   make me glad   for ye had   kissed her ere ye left her  before he had finished his song the princess was just under the place where he sat and looking up to find him  her ears had led her truly  would you like a fall princess said the prince looking down  ah there you are  yes if you please prince said the princess looking up  how do you know i am a prince princess said the prince  because you are a very nice young man prince said the princess  come up then princess  fetch me prince  the prince took off his scarf then his sword-belt then his tunic and tied them all together and let them down  but the line was far too short  he unwound his turban and added it to the rest when it was all but long enough and his purse completed it  the princess just managed to lay hold of the knot of money and was beside him in a moment  this rock was much higher than the other and the splash and the dive were tremendous  the princess was in ecstasies of delight and their swim was delicious  night after night they met and swam about in the dark clear lake where such was the prince's gladness that whether the princess's way of looking at things infected him or he was actually getting light-headed he often fancied that he was swimming in the sky instead of the lake  but when he talked about being in heaven the princess laughed at him dreadfully  when the moon came she brought them fresh pleasure  everything looked strange and new in her light with an old withered yet unfading newness  when the moon was nearly full one of their great delights was to dive deep in the water and then turning round look up through it at the great blot of light close above them shimmering and trembling and wavering spreading and contracting seeming to melt away and again grow solid  then they would shoot up through the blot and lo there was the moon far off clear and steady and cold and very lovely at the bottom of a deeper and bluer lake than theirs as the princess said  the prince soon found out that while in the water the princess was very like other people  and besides this she was not so forward in her questions or pert in her replies at sea as on shore  neither did she laugh so much and when she did laugh it was more gently  she seemed altogether more modest and maidenly in the water than out of it  but when the prince who had really fallen in love when he fell in the lake began to talk to her about love she always turned her head towards him and laughed  after a while she began to look puzzled as if she were trying to understand what he meant but could not revealing a notion that he meant something  but as soon as ever she left the lake she was so altered that the prince said to himself if i marry her i see no help for it  we must turn merman and mermaid and go out to sea at once    11  hiss  the princess's pleasure in the lake had grown to a passion and she could scarcely bear to be out of it for an hour  imagine then her consternation when diving with the prince one night a sudden suspicion seized her that the lake was not so deep as it used to be the prince could not imagine what had happened  she shot to the surface and without a word swam at full speed towards the higher side of the lake  he followed begging to know if she was ill or what was the matter  she never turned her head or took the smallest notice of his question  arrived at the shore she coasted the rocks with minute inspection  but she was not able to come to a conclusion for the moon was very small and so she could not see well  she turned therefore and swam home without saying a word to explain her conduct to the prince of whose presence she seemed no longer conscious  he withdrew to his cave in great perplexity and distress  next day she made many observations which alas strengthened her fears  she saw that the banks were too dry and that the grass on the shore and the trailing plants on the rocks were withering away  she caused marks to be made along the borders and examined them day after day in all directions of the wind till at last the horrible idea became a certain fact that the surface of the lake was slowly sinking  the poor princess nearly went out of the little mind she had  it was awful to her to see the lake which she loved more than any living thing lie dying before her eyes  it sank away slowly vanishing  the tops of rocks that had never been seen till now began to appear far down in the clear water  before long they were dry in the sun  it was fearful to think of the mud that would soon lie there baking and festering full of lovely creatures dying and ugly creatures coming to life like the unmaking of a world  and how hot the sun would be without any lake  she could not bear to swim in it any more and began to pine away  her life seemed bound up with it and ever as the lake sank she pined  people said she would not live an hour after the lake was gone  but she never cried  a proclamation was made to all the kingdom that whosoever should discover the cause of the lake's decrease would be rewarded after a princely fashion  hum-drum and kopy-keck applied themselves to their physics and metaphysics but in vain  not even they could suggest a cause  now the fact was that the old princess was at the root of the mischief when she heard that her niece found more pleasure in the water than any one else out of it she went into a rage and cursed herself for her want of foresight  but said she i will soon set all right  the king and the people shall die of thirst their brains shall boil and frizzle in their skulls before i will lose my revenge  and she laughed a ferocious laugh that made the hairs on the back of her black cat stand erect with terror  then she went to an old chest in the room and opening it took out what looked like a piece of dried seaweed  this she threw into a tub of water  then she threw some powder into the water and stirred it with her bare arm muttering over it words of hideous sound and yet more hideous import  then she set the tub aside and took from the chest a huge bunch of a hundred rusty keys that clattered in her shaking hands  then she sat down and proceeded to oil them all before she had finished out from the tub the water of which had kept on a slow motion ever since she had ceased stirring it came the head and half the body of a huge gray snake  but the witch did not look round  it grew out of the tub waving itself backwards and forwards with a slow horizontal motion till it reached the princess when it laid its head upon her shoulder and gave a low hiss in her ear  she started but with joy and seeing the head resting on her shoulder drew it towards her and kissed it  then she drew it all out of the tub and wound it round her body  it was one of those dreadful creatures which few have ever beheld the white snakes of darkness  then she took the keys and went down to her cellar and as she unlocked the door she said to herself   this is worth living for  locking the door behind her she descended a few steps into the cellar and crossing it unlocked another door into a dark narrow passage she locked this also behind her and descended a few more steps  if any one had followed the witch-princess he would have heard her unlock exactly one hundred doors and descend a few steps after unlocking each  when she had unlocked the last she entered a vast cave the roof of which was supported by huge natural pillars of rock  now this roof was the under side of the bottom of the lake  she then untwined the snake from her body and held it by the tail high above her  the hideous creature stretched up its head towards the roof of the cavern which it was just able to reach  it then began to move its head backwards and forwards with a slow oscillating motion as if looking for something  at the same moment the witch began to walk round and round the cavern coming nearer to the centre every circuit while the head of the snake described the same path over the roof that she did over the floor for she kept holding it up  and still it kept slowly oscillating  round and round the cavern they went ever lessening the circuit till at last the snake made a sudden dart and clung to the roof with its mouth  that's right my beauty cried the princess drain it dry  she let it go left it hanging and sat down on a great stone with her black cat which had followed her all round the cave by her side then she began to knit and mutter awful words  the snake hung like a huge leech sucking at the stone the cat stood with his back arched and his tail like a piece of cable looking up at the snake and the old woman sat and knitted and muttered  seven days and seven nights they remained thus when suddenly the serpent dropped from the roof as if exhausted and shrivelled up till it was again like a piece of dried seaweed  the witch started to her feet picked it up put it in her pocket and looked up at the roof  one drop of water was trembling on the spot where the snake had been sucking  as soon as she saw that she turned and fled followed by her cat  shutting the door in a terrible hurry she locked it and having muttered some frightful words sped to the next which also she locked and muttered over and so with all the hundred doors till she arrived in her own cellar then she sat down on the floor ready to faint but listening with malicious delight to the rushing of the water which she could hear distinctly through all the hundred doors  but this was not enough  now that she had tasted revenge she lost her patience  without further measures the lake would be too long in disappearing  so the next night with the last shred of the dying old moon rising she took some of the water in which she had revived the snake put it in a bottle and set out accompanied by her cat  before morning she had made the entire circuit of the lake muttering fearful words as she crossed every stream and casting into it some of the water out of her bottle  when she had finished the circuit she muttered yet again and flung a handful of water towards the moon thereupon every spring in the country ceased to throb and bubble dying away like the pulse of a dying man  the next day there was no sound of falling water to be heard along the borders of the lake  the very courses were dry and the mountains showed no silvery streaks down their dark sides  and not alone had the fountains of mother earth ceased to flow for all the babies throughout the country were crying dreadfully only without tears    12  where is the prince  never since the night when the princess left him so abruptly had the prince had a single interview with her  he had seen her once or twice in the lake but as far as he could discover she had not been in it any more at night  he had sat and sung and looked in vain for his nereid while she like a true nereid was wasting away with her lake sinking as it sank withering as it dried  when at length he discovered the change that was taking place in the level of the water he was in great alarm and perplexity  he could not tell whether the lake was dying because the lady had forsaken it or whether the lady would not come because the lake had begun to sink  but he resolved to know so much at least  he disguised himself and going to the palace requested to see the lord chamberlain  his appearance at once gained his request and the lord chamberlain being a man of some insight perceived that there was more in the prince's solicitation than met the ear  he felt likewise that no one could tell whence a solution of the present difficulties might arise  so he granted the prince's prayer to be made shoeblack to the princess  it was rather cunning in the prince to request such an easy post for the princess could not possibly soil as many shoes as other princesses  he soon learned all that could be told about the princess  he went nearly distracted but after roaming about the lake for days and diving in every depth that remained all that he could do was to put an extra polish on the dainty pair of boots that was never called for  for the princess kept her room with the curtains drawn to shut out the dying lake but she could not shut it out of her mind for a moment  it haunted her imagination so that she felt as if the lake were her soul drying up within her first to mud then to madness and death  she thus brooded over the change with all its dreadful accompaniments till she was nearly distracted  as for the prince she had forgotten him  however much she had enjoyed his company in the water she did not care for him without it  but she seemed to have forgotten her father and mother too  the lake went on sinking  small slimy spots began to appear which glittered steadily amidst the changeful shine of the water  these grew to broad patches of mud which widened and spread with rocks here and there and floundering fishes and crawling eels swarming  the people went everywhere catching these and looking for anything that might have dropped from the royal boats  at length the lake was all but gone only a few of the deepest pools remaining unexhausted  it happened one day that a party of youngsters found themselves on the brink of one of these pools in the very centre of the lake  it was a rocky basin of considerable depth  looking in they saw at the bottom something that shone yellow in the sun  a little boy jumped in and dived for it  it was a plate of gold covered with writing  they carried it to the king  on one side of it stood these words      death alone from death can save   love is death and so is brave    love can fill the deepest grave   love loves on beneath the wave   now this was enigmatical enough to the king and courtiers  but the reverse of the plate explained it a little  its writing amounted to this    if the lake should disappear they must find the hole through which the water ran  but it would be useless to try to stop it by any ordinary means  there was but one effectual mode the body of a living man could alone stanch the flow  the man must give himself of his own will and the lake must take his life as it filled  otherwise the offering would be of no avail  if the nation could not provide one hero it was time it should perish    13  here i am  this was a very disheartening revelation to the king not that he was unwilling to sacrifice a subject but that he was hopeless of finding a man willing to sacrifice himself  no time was to be lost however for the princess was lying motionless on her bed and taking no nourishment but lake-water which was now none of the best  therefore the king caused the contents of the wonderful plate of gold to be published throughout the country  no one however came forward  the prince having gone several days' journey into the forest to consult a hermit whom he had met there on his way to lagobel knew nothing of the oracle till his return  when he had acquainted himself with all the particulars he sat down and thought   she will die if i don't do it and life would be nothing to me without her so i shall lose nothing by doing it  and life will be as pleasant to her as ever for she will soon forget me  and there will be so much more beauty and happiness in the world to be sure i shall not see it  here the poor prince gave a sigh how lovely the lake will be in the moonlight with that glorious creature sporting in it like a wild goddess it is rather hard to be drowned by inches though  let me see that will be seventy inches of me to drown  here he tried to laugh but could not the longer the better however he resumed  for can i not bargain that the princess shall be beside me all the time  so i shall see her once more kiss her perhaps who knows and die looking in her eyes  it will be no death  at least i shall not feel it  and to see the lake filling for the beauty again all right i am ready  he kissed the princess's boot laid it down and hurried to the king's apartment  but feeling as he went that anything sentimental would be disagreeable he resolved to carry off the whole affair with nonchalance  so he knocked at the door of the king's counting-house where it was all but a capital crime to disturb him  when the king heard the knock he started up and opened the door in a rage  seeing only the shoeblack he drew his sword  this i am sorry to say was his usual mode of asserting his regality when he thought his dignity was in danger  but the prince was not in the least alarmed  please your majesty i'm your butler said he  my butler you lying rascal  what do you mean  i mean i will cork your big bottle  is the fellow mad bawled the king raising the point of his sword  i will put a stopper plug what you call it in your leaky lake grand monarch said the prince  the king was in such a rage that before he could speak he had time to cool and to reflect that it would be great waste to kill the only man who was willing to be useful in the present emergency seeing that in the end the insolent fellow would be as dead as if he had died by his majesty's own hand  oh said he at last putting up his sword with difficulty it was so long i am obliged to you you young fool  take a glass of wine  no thank you replied the prince  very well said the king  would you like to run and see your parents before you make your experiment  no thank you said the prince  then we will go and look for the hole at once said his majesty and proceeded to call some attendants  stop please your majesty i have a condition to make interposed the prince  what exclaimed the king a condition and with me  how dare you  as you please returned the prince coolly  i wish your majesty a good morning  you wretch  i will have you put in a sack and stuck in the hole  very well your majesty replied the prince becoming a little more respectful lest the wrath of the king should deprive him of the pleasure of dying for the princess  but what good will that do your majesty  please to remember that the oracle says the victim must offer himself  well you have offered yourself retorted the king  yes upon one condition  condition again roared the king once more drawing his sword begone  somebody else will be glad enough to take the honour off your shoulders  your majesty knows it will not be easy to get another to take my place  well what is your condition growled the king feeling that the prince was right  only this replied the prince  that as i must on no account die before i am fairly drowned and the waiting will be rather wearisome the princess your daughter shall go with me feed me with her own hands and look at me now and then to comfort me for you must confess it is rather hard  as soon as the water is up to my eyes she may go and be happy and forget her poor shoeblack  here the prince's voice faltered and he very nearly grew sentimental in spite of his resolution  why didn't you tell me before what your condition was  such a fuss about nothing exclaimed the king  do you grant it persisted the prince  of course i do replied the king  very well  i am ready  go and have some dinner then while i set my people to find the place  the king ordered out his guards and gave directions to the officers to find the hole in the lake at once  so the bed of the lake was marked out in divisions and thoroughly examined and in an hour or so the hole was discovered  it was in the middle of a stone near the centre of the lake in the very pool where the golden plate had been found  it was a three-cornered hole of no great size  there was water all round the stone but very little was flowing through the hole    14  this is very kind of you  the prince went to dress for the occasion for he was resolved to die like a prince  when the princess heard that a man had offered to die for her she was so transported that she jumped off the bed feeble as she was and danced about the room for joy  she did not care who the man was that was nothing to her  the hole wanted stopping and if only a man would do why take one  in an hour or two more everything was ready  her maid dressed her in haste and they carried her to the side of the lake  when she saw it she shrieked and covered her face with her hands  they bore her across to the stone where they had already placed a little boat for her  the water was not deep enough to float it but they hoped it would be before long  they laid her on cushions placed in the boat wines and fruits and other nice things and stretched a canopy over all  in a few minutes the prince appeared  the princess recognized him at once but did not think it worth while to acknowledge him  here i am said the prince  put me in  they told me it was a shoeblack said the princess  so i am said the prince  i blacked your little boots three times a day because they were all i could get of you  put me in  the courtiers did not resent his bluntness except by saying to each other that he was taking it out in impudence  but how was he to be put in  the golden plate contained no instructions on this point  the prince looked at the hole and saw but one way  he put both his legs into it sitting on the stone and stooping forward covered the corner that remained open with his two hands  in this uncomfortable position he resolved to abide his fate and turning to the people said   now you can go  the king had already gone home to dinner  now you can go repeated the princess after him like a parrot  the people obeyed her and went  presently a little wave flowed over the stone and wetted one of the prince's knees  but he did not mind it much  he began to sing and the song he sang was this      as a world that has no well   darting bright in forest dell   as a world without the gleam   of the downward-going stream   as a world without the glance   of the ocean's fair expanse   as a world where never rain   glittered on the sunny plain    such my heart thy world would be   if no love did flow in thee    as a world without the sound   of the rivulets underground   or the bubbling of the spring   out of darkness wandering   or the mighty rush and flowing   of the river's downward going   or the music-showers that drop   on the outspread beech's top   or the ocean's mighty voice   when his lifted waves rejoice    such my soul thy world would be   if no love did sing in thee    lady keep thy world's delight   keep the waters in thy sight   love hath made me strong to go   for thy sake to realms below   where the water's shine and hum   through the darkness never come   let i pray one thought of me   spring a little well in thee   lest thy loveless soul be found   like a dry and thirsty ground   sing again prince  it makes it less tedious said the princess  but the prince was too much overcome to sing any more and a long pause followed  this is very kind of you prince said the princess at last quite coolly as she lay in the boat with her eyes shut  i am sorry i can't return the compliment thought the prince but you are worth dying for after all  again a wavelet and another and another flowed over the stone and wetted both the prince's knees but he did not speak or move two three four hours passed in this way the princess apparently asleep and the prince very patient  but he was much disappointed in his position for he had none of the consolation he had hoped for  at last he could bear it no longer  princess said he  but at the moment up started the princess crying   i'm afloat  i'm afloat  and the little boat bumped against the stone  princess repeated the prince encouraged by seeing her wide awake and looking eagerly at the water  well said she without looking round  your papa promised that you should look at me and you haven't looked at me once  did he  then i suppose i must  but i am so sleepy  sleep then darling and don't mind me said the poor prince  really you are very good replied the princess  i think i will go to sleep again  just give me a glass of wine and a biscuit first said the prince very humbly  with all my heart said the princess and gaped as she said it  she got the wine and the biscuit however and leaning over the side of the boat towards him was compelled to look at him  why prince she said you don't look well  are you sure you don't mind it not a bit answered he feeling very faint indeed  only i shall die before it is of any use to you unless i have something to eat  there then said she holding out the wine to him  ah you must feed me  i dare not move my hands  the water would run away directly  good gracious said the princess and she began at once to feed him with bits of biscuit and sips of wine  as she fed him he contrived to kiss the tips of her fingers now and then  she did not seem to mind it one way or the other  but the prince felt better  now for your own sake princess said he i cannot let you go to sleep  you must sit and look at me else i shall not be able to keep up  well i will do anything i can to oblige you answered she with condescension and sitting down she did look at him and kept looking at him with wonderful steadiness considering all things  the sun went down and the moon rose and gush after gush the waters were rising up the prince's body  they were up to his waist now  why can't we go and have a swim said the princess  there seems to be water enough just about here  i shall never swim more said the prince  oh i forgot said the princess and was silent  so the water grew and grew and rose up and up on the prince  and the princess sat and looked at him  she fed him now and then  the night wore on  the waters rose and rose  the moon rose likewise higher and higher and shone full on the face of the dying prince  the water was up to his neck  will you kiss me princess said he feebly  the nonchalance was all gone now  yes i will answered the princess and kissed him with a long sweet cold kiss  now said he with a sigh of content i die happy  he did not speak again  the princess gave him some wine for the last time  he was past eating  then she sat down again and looked at him the water rose and rose  it touched his chin  it touched his lower lip  it touched between his lips  he shut them hard to keep it out the princess began to feel strange  it touched his upper lip  he breathed through his nostrils  the princess looked wild  it covered his nostrils  her eyes looked scared and shone strange in the moonlight  his head fell back the water closed over it and the bubbles of his last breath bubbled up through the water  the princess gave a shriek and sprang into the lake  she laid hold first of one leg and then of the other and pulled and tugged but she could not move either  she stopped to take breath and that made her think that he could not get any breath  she was frantic she got hold of him and held his head above the water which was possible now his hands were no longer on the hole  but it was of no use for he was past breathing  love and water brought back all her strength  she got under the water and pulled and pulled with her whole might till at last she got one leg out  the other easily followed  how she got him into the boat she never could tell but when she did she fainted away  coming to herself she seized the oars kept herself steady as best she could and rowed and rowed though she had never rowed before  round rocks and over shallows and through mud she rowed till she got to the landing-stairs of the palace  by this time her people were on the shore for they had heard her shriek  she made them carry the prince to her own room and lay him in her bed and light a fire and send for the doctors  but the lake your highness said the chamberlain who roused by the noise came in in his nightcap  go and drown yourself in it she said  this was the last rudeness of which the princess was ever guilty and one must allow that she had good cause to feel provoked with the lord chamberlain  had it been the king himself he would have fared no better  but both he and the queen were fast asleep  and the chamberlain went back to his bed  somehow the doctors never came  so the princess and her old nurse were left with the prince  but the old nurse was a wise woman and knew what to do  they tried everything for a long time without success  the princess was nearly distracted between hope and fear but she tried on and on one thing after another and everything over and over again  at last when they had all but given it up just as the sun rose the prince opened his eyes    15  look at the rain  the princess burst into a passion of tears and fell on the floor there she lay for an hour and her tears never ceased  all the pent-up crying of her life was spent now  and a rain came on such as had never been seen in that country  the sun shone all the time and the great drops which fell straight to the earth shone likewise  the palace was in the heart of a rainbow  it was a rain of rubies and sapphires and emeralds and topazes  the torrents poured from the mountains like molten gold and if it had not been for its subterraneous outlet the lake would have overflowed and inundated the country  it was full from shore to shore  but the princess did not heed the lake  she lay on the floor and wept and this rain within doors was far more wonderful than the rain out of doors  for when it abated a little and she proceeded to rise she found to her astonishment that she could not  at length after many efforts she succeeded in getting upon her feet  but she tumbled down again directly  hearing her fall her old nurse uttered a yell of delight and ran to her screaming   my darling child she's found her gravity  oh that's it is it said the princess rubbing her shoulder and her knee alternately  i consider it very unpleasant  i feel as if i should be crushed to pieces  hurrah cried the prince from the bed  if you've come round princess so have i  how's the lake  brimful answered the nurse  then we're all happy  that we are indeed answered the princess sobbing  and there was rejoicing all over the country that rainy day  even the babies forgot their past troubles and danced and crowed amazingly and the king told stories and the queen listened to them  and he divided the money in his box and she the honey in her pot among all the children  and there was such jubilation as was never heard of before  of course the prince and princess were betrothed at once  but the princess had to learn to walk before they could be married with any propriety  and this was not so easy at her time of life for she could walk no more than a baby  she was always falling down and hurting herself  is this the gravity you used to make so much of said she one day to the prince as he raised her from the floor  for my part i was a great deal more comfortable without it  no no that's not it  this is it replied the prince as he took her up and carried her about like a baby kissing her all the time this is gravity  that's better said she  i don't mind that so much  and she smiled the sweetest loveliest smile in the prince's face  and she gave him one little kiss in return for all his and he thought them overpaid for he was beside himself with delight  i fear she complained of her gravity more than once after this notwithstanding  it was a long time before she got reconciled to walking  but the pain of learning it was quite counterbalanced by two things either of which would have been sufficient consolation  the first was that the prince himself was her teacher and the second that she could tumble into the lake as often as she pleased  still she preferred to have the prince jump in with her and the splash they made before was nothing to the splash they made now  the lake never sank again  in process of time it wore the roof of the cavern quite through and was twice as deep as before  the only revenge the princess took upon her aunt was to tread pretty hard on her gouty toe the next time she saw her  but she was sorry for it the very next day when she heard that the water had undermined her house and that it had fallen in the night burying her in its ruins whence no one ever ventured to dig up her body  there she lies to this day  so the prince and princess lived and were happy and had crowns of gold and clothes of cloth and shoes of leather and children of boys and girls not one of whom was ever known on the most critical occasion to lose the smallest atom of his or her due proportion of gravity
