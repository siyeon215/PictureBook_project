whole name was tippetarius but no one was expected to say such a long word when tip would do just as well  this boy remembered nothing of his parents for he had been brought when quite young to be reared by the old woman known as mombi whose reputation i am sorry to say was none of the best for the gillikin people had reason to suspect her of indulging in magical arts and therefore hesitated to associate with her  [illustration  image016]  mombi was not exactly a witch because the good witch who ruled that part of the land of oz had forbidden any other witch to exist in her dominions so tip’s guardian however much she might aspire to working magic realized it was unlawful to be more than a sorceress or at most a wizardess  tip was made to carry wood from the forest that the old woman might boil her pot he also worked in the corn-fields hoeing and husking and he fed the pigs and milked the four-horned cow that was mombi’s especial pride  but you must not suppose he worked all the time for he felt that would be bad for him when sent to the forest tip often climbed trees for birds’ eggs or amused himself chasing the fleet white rabbits or fishing in the brooks with bent pins then he would hastily gather his armful of wood and carry it home and when he was supposed to be working in the corn-fields and the tall stalks hid him from mombi’s view tip would often dig in the gopher holes or if the mood seized him—lie upon his back between the rows of corn and take a nap so by taking care not to exhaust his strength he grew as strong and rugged as a boy may be  mombi’s curious magic often frightened her neighbors and they treated her shyly yet respectfully because of her weird powers but tip frankly hated her and took no pains to hide his feelings indeed he sometimes showed less respect for the old woman than he should have done considering she was his guardian  there were pumpkins in mombi’s corn-fields lying golden red among the rows of green stalks and these had been planted and carefully tended that the four-horned cow might eat of them in the winter time but one day after the corn had all been cut and stacked and tip was carrying the pumpkins to the stable he took a notion to make a jack lantern and try to give the old woman a fright with it  [illustration  image017]  so he selected a fine big pumpkin—one with a lustrous orange-red color—and began carving it with the point of his knife he made two round eyes a three-cornered nose and a mouth shaped like a new moon the face when completed could not have been considered strictly beautiful but it wore a smile so big and broad and was so jolly in expression that even tip laughed as he looked admiringly at his work  the child had no playmates so he did not know that boys often dig out the inside of a pumpkin-jack and in the space thus made put a lighted candle to render the face more startling but he conceived an idea of his own that promised to be quite as effective he decided to manufacture the form of a man who would wear this pumpkin head and to stand it in a place where old mombi would meet it face to face  and then said tip to himself with a laugh she’ll squeal louder than the brown pig does when i pull her tail and shiver with fright worse than i did last year when i had the ague  he had plenty of time to accomplish this task for mombi had gone to a village—to buy groceries she said—and it was a journey of at least two days  [illustration  image019]  so he took his axe to the forest and selected some stout straight saplings which he cut down and trimmed of all their twigs and leaves from these he would make the arms and legs and feet of his man for the body he stripped a sheet of thick bark from around a big tree and with much labor fashioned it into a cylinder of about the right size pinning the edges together with wooden pegs then whistling happily as he worked he carefully jointed the limbs and fastened them to the body with pegs whittled into shape with his knife  by the time this feat had been accomplished it began to grow dark and tip remembered he must milk the cow and feed the pigs so he picked up his wooden man and carried it back to the house with him  during the evening by the light of the fire in the kitchen tip carefully rounded all the edges of the joints and smoothed the rough places in a neat and workmanlike manner then he stood the figure up against the wall and admired it it seemed remarkably tall even for a full-grown man but that was a good point in a small boy’s eyes and tip did not object at all to the size of his creation  next morning when he looked at his work again tip saw he had forgotten to give the dummy a neck by means of which he might fasten the pumpkinhead to the body so he went again to the forest which was not far away and chopped from a tree several pieces of wood with which to complete his work when he returned he fastened a cross-piece to the upper end of the body making a hole through the center to hold upright the neck the bit of wood which formed this neck was also sharpened at the upper end and when all was ready tip put on the pumpkin head pressing it well down onto the neck and found that it fitted very well the head could be turned to one side or the other as he pleased and the hinges of the arms and legs allowed him to place the dummy in any position he desired  now that declared tip proudly is really a very fine man and it ought to frighten several screeches out of old mombi but it would be much more lifelike if it were properly dressed  to find clothing seemed no easy task but tip boldly ransacked the great chest in which mombi kept all her keepsakes and treasures and at the very bottom he discovered some purple trousers a red shirt and a pink vest which was dotted with white spots these he carried away to his man and succeeded although the garments did not fit very well in dressing the creature in a jaunty fashion some knit stockings belonging to mombi and a much worn pair of his own shoes completed the man’s apparel and tip was so delighted that he danced up and down and laughed aloud in boyish ecstacy  i must give him a name he cried so good a man as this must surely have a name i believe he added after a moment’s thought i will name the fellow ‘jack pumpkinhead’  [illustration  image023]  [illustration  image024]  [illustration  image025]     the marvelous powder of life   after considering the matter carefully tip decided that the best place to locate jack would be at the bend in the road a little way from the house so he started to carry his man there but found him heavy and rather awkward to handle after dragging the creature a short distance tip stood him on his feet and by first bending the joints of one leg and then those of the other at the same time pushing from behind the boy managed to induce jack to walk to the bend in the road it was not accomplished without a few tumbles and tip really worked harder than he ever had in the fields or forest but a love of mischief urged him on and it pleased him to test the cleverness of his workmanship  jack’s all right and works fine he said to himself panting with the unusual exertion but just then he discovered the man’s left arm had fallen off in the journey so he went back to find it and afterward by whittling a new and stouter pin for the shoulder-joint he repaired the injury so successfully that the arm was stronger than before tip also noticed that jack’s pumpkin head had twisted around until it faced his back but this was easily remedied when at last the man was set up facing the turn in the path where old mombi was to appear he looked natural enough to be a fair imitation of a gillikin farmer—and unnatural enough to startle anyone that came on him unawares  as it was yet too early in the day to expect the old woman to return home tip went down into the valley below the farm-house and began to gather nuts from the trees that grew there  however old mombi returned earlier than usual she had met a crooked wizard who resided in a lonely cave in the mountains and had traded several important secrets of magic with him having in this way secured three new recipes four magical powders and a selection of herbs of wonderful power and potency she hobbled home as fast as she could in order to test her new sorceries  so intent was mombi on the treasures she had gained that when she turned the bend in the road and caught a glimpse of the man she merely nodded and said   good evening sir  but a moment after noting that the person did not move or reply she cast a shrewd glance into his face and discovered his pumpkin head elaborately carved by tip’s jack-knife  heh ejaculated mombi giving a sort of grunt that rascally boy has been playing tricks again very good ve—ry good i’ll beat him black-and-blue for trying to scare me in this fashion  angrily she raised her stick to smash in the grinning pumpkin head of the dummy but a sudden thought made her pause the uplifted stick left motionless in the air  why here is a good chance to try my new powder said she eagerly and then i can tell whether that crooked wizard has fairly traded secrets or whether he has fooled me as wickedly as i fooled him  so she set down her basket and began fumbling in it for one of the precious powders she had obtained  while mombi was thus occupied tip strolled back with his pockets full of nuts and discovered the old woman standing beside his man and apparently not the least bit frightened by it  at first he was generally disappointed but the next moment he became curious to know what mombi was going to do so he hid behind a hedge where he could see without being seen and prepared to watch  after some search the woman drew from her basket an old pepper-box upon the faded label of which the wizard had written with a lead-pencil   powder of life  ah—here it is she cried joyfully and now let us see if it is potent the stingy wizard didn’t give me much of it but i guess there’s enough for two or three doses  [illustration  image029]  tip was much surprised when he overheard this speech then he saw old mombi raise her arm and sprinkle the powder from the box over the pumpkin head of his man jack she did this in the same way one would pepper a baked potato and the powder sifted down from jack’s head and scattered over the red shirt and pink waistcoat and purple trousers tip had dressed him in and a portion even fell upon the patched and worn shoes  then putting the pepper-box back into the basket mombi lifted her left hand with its little finger pointed upward and said   weaugh  then she lifted her right hand with the thumb pointed upward and said   teaugh  then she lifted both hands with all the fingers and thumbs spread out and cried   peaugh  jack pumpkinhead stepped back a pace at this and said in a reproachful voice   don’t yell like that do you think i’m deaf  old mombi danced around him frantic with delight  he lives she screamed  he lives he lives  then she threw her stick into the air and caught it as it came down and she hugged herself with both arms and tried to do a step of a jig and all the time she repeated rapturously   he lives—he lives—he lives  now you may well suppose that tip observed all this with amazement  at first he was so frightened and horrified that he wanted to run away but his legs trembled and shook so badly that he couldn’t then it struck him as a very funny thing for jack to come to life especially as the expression on his pumpkin face was so droll and comical it excited laughter on the instant so recovering from his first fear tip began to laugh and the merry peals reached old mombi’s ears and made her hobble quickly to the hedge where she seized tip’s collar and dragged him back to where she had left her basket and the pumpkinheaded man  you naughty sneaking wicked boy she exclaimed furiously  i’ll teach you to spy out my secrets and to make fun of me  i wasn’t making fun of you protested tip i was laughing at old pumpkinhead look at him isn’t he a picture though  i hope you are not reflecting on my personal appearance said jack and it was so funny to hear his grave voice while his face continued to wear its jolly smile that tip again burst into a peal of laughter  [illustration  image032]  even mombi was not without a curious interest in the man her magic had brought to life for after staring at him intently she presently asked   what do you know  well that is hard to tell replied jack for although i feel that i know a tremendous lot i am not yet aware how much there is in the world to find out about it will take me a little time to discover whether i am very wise or very foolish  to be sure said mombi thoughtfully  but what are you going to do with him now he is alive asked tip wondering  i must think it over answered mombi but we must get home at once for it is growing dark help the pumpkinhead to walk  never mind me said jack i can walk as well as you can haven’t i got legs and feet and aren’t they jointed  are they asked the woman turning to tip  of course they are i made ’em myself returned the boy with pride  so they started for the house but when they reached the farm yard old mombi led the pumpkin man to the cow stable and shut him up in an empty stall fastening the door securely on the outside  i’ve got to attend to you first she said nodding her head at tip  hearing this the boy became uneasy for he knew mombi had a bad and revengeful heart and would not hesitate to do any evil thing  they entered the house it was a round domeshaped structure as are nearly all the farm houses in the land of oz  mombi bade the boy light a candle while she put her basket in a cupboard and hung her cloak on a peg tip obeyed quickly for he was afraid of her  after the candle had been lighted mombi ordered him to build a fire in the hearth and while tip was thus engaged the old woman ate her supper when the flames began to crackle the boy came to her and asked a share of the bread and cheese but mombi refused him  i’m hungry said tip in a sulky tone  you won’t be hungry long replied mombi with a grim look  the boy didn’t like this speech for it sounded like a threat but he happened to remember he had nuts in his pocket so he cracked some of those and ate them while the woman rose shook the crumbs from her apron and hung above the fire a small black kettle  then she measured out equal parts of milk and vinegar and poured them into the kettle next she produced several packets of herbs and powders and began adding a portion of each to the contents of the kettle occasionally she would draw near the candle and read from a yellow paper the recipe of the mess she was concocting  as tip watched her his uneasiness increased  what is that for he asked  for you returned mombi briefly  tip wriggled around upon his stool and stared awhile at the kettle which was beginning to bubble then he would glance at the stern and wrinkled features of the witch and wish he were any place but in that dim and smoky kitchen where even the shadows cast by the candle upon the wall were enough to give one the horrors so an hour passed away during which the silence was only broken by the bubbling of the pot and the hissing of the flames  finally tip spoke again  have i got to drink that stuff he asked nodding toward the pot  yes said mombi  what’ll it do to me asked tip  if it’s properly made replied mombi it will change or transform you into a marble statue  tip groaned and wiped the perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve  i don’t want to be a marble statue he protested  [illustration  image037]  that doesn’t matter i want you to be one said the old woman looking at him severely  what use’ll i be then asked tip there won’t be any one to work for you  i’ll make the pumpkinhead work for me said mombi  again tip groaned  why don’t you change me into a goat or a chicken he asked anxiously you can’t do anything with a marble statue  oh yes i can returned mombi i’m going to plant a flower garden next spring and i’ll put you in the middle of it for an ornament i wonder i haven’t thought of that before you’ve been a bother to me for years  at this terrible speech tip felt the beads of perspiration starting all over his body but he sat still and shivered and looked anxiously at the kettle  perhaps it won’t work he mutttered in a voice that sounded weak and discouraged  oh i think it will answered mombi cheerfully i seldom make a mistake  again there was a period of silence a silence so long and gloomy that when mombi finally lifted the kettle from the fire it was close to midnight  you cannot drink it until it has become quite cold announced the old witch for in spite of the law she had acknowledged practising witchcraft we must both go to bed now and at daybreak i will call you and at once complete your transformation into a marble statue  with this she hobbled into her room bearing the steaming kettle with her and tip heard her close and lock the door  the boy did not go to bed as he had been commanded to do but still sat glaring at the embers of the dying fire  [illustration  image038]  [illustration  image039]     the flight of the fugitives   tip reflected  it’s a hard thing to be a marble statue he thought rebelliously and i’m not going to stand it for years i’ve been a bother to her she says so she’s going to get rid of me well there’s an easier way than to become a statue no boy could have any fun forever standing in the middle of a flower garden i’ll run away that’s what i’ll do—and i may as well go before she makes me drink that nasty stuff in the kettle he waited until the snores of the old witch announced she was fast asleep and then he arose softly and went to the cupboard to find something to eat  no use starting on a journey without food he decided searching upon the narrow shelves  he found some crusts of bread but he had to look into mombi’s basket to find the cheese she had brought from the village while turning over the contents of the basket he came upon the pepper-box which contained the powder of life  i may as well take this with me he thought or mombi’ll be using it to make more mischief with so he put the box in his pocket together with the bread and cheese  then he cautiously left the house and latched the door behind him outside both moon and stars shone brightly and the night seemed peaceful and inviting after the close and ill-smelling kitchen  i’ll be glad to get away said tip softly for i never did like that old woman i wonder how i ever came to live with her  he was walking slowly toward the road when a thought made him pause  i don’t like to leave jack pumpkinhead to the tender mercies of old mombi he muttered and jack belongs to me for i made him even if the old witch did bring him to life  he retraced his steps to the cow-stable and opened the door of the stall where the pumpkin-headed man had been left  jack was standing in the middle of the stall and by the moonlight tip could see he was smiling just as jovially as ever  come on said the boy beckoning  where to asked jack  you’ll know as soon as i do answered tip smiling sympathetically into the pumpkin face  all we’ve got to do now is to tramp  very well returned jack and walked awkwardly out of the stable and into the moonlight  tip turned toward the road and the man followed him jack walked with a sort of limp and occasionally one of the joints of his legs would turn backward instead of frontwise almost causing him to tumble but the pumpkinhead was quick to notice this and began to take more pains to step carefully so that he met with few accidents  [illustration  image041]  tip led him along the path without stopping an instant they could not go very fast but they walked steadily and by the time the moon sank away and the sun peeped over the hills they had travelled so great a distance that the boy had no reason to fear pursuit from the old witch moreover he had turned first into one path and then into another so that should anyone follow them it would prove very difficult to guess which way they had gone or where to seek them  fairly satisfied that he had escaped—for a time at least—being turned into a marble statue the boy stopped his companion and seated himself upon a rock by the roadside  let’s have some breakfast he said  jack pumpkinhead watched tip curiously but refused to join in the repast i don’t seem to be made the same way you are he said  i know you are not returned tip for i made you  oh did you asked jack  [illustration  image043]  certainly and put you together and carved your eyes and nose and ears and mouth said tip proudly and dressed you  jack looked at his body and limbs critically  it strikes me you made a very good job of it he remarked  just so-so replied tip modestly for he began to see certain defects in the construction of his man if i’d known we were going to travel together i might have been a little more particular  why then said the pumpkinhead in a tone that expressed surprise you must be my creator my parent my father  or your inventor replied the boy with a laugh yes my son i really believe i am  then i owe you obedience continued the man and you owe me—support  that’s it exactly declared tip jumping up so let us be off  where are we going asked jack when they had resumed their journey  i’m not exactly sure said the boy but i believe we are headed south and that will bring us sooner or later to the emerald city  what city is that enquired the pumpkinhead  why it’s the center of the land of oz and the biggest town in all the country i’ve never been there myself but i’ve heard all about its history it was built by a mighty and wonderful wizard named oz and everything there is of a green color—just as everything in this country of the gillikins is of a purple color  is everything here purple asked jack  of course it is can’t you see returned the boy  i believe i must be color-blind said the pumpkinhead after staring about him  well the grass is purple and the trees are purple and the houses and fences are purple explained tip even the mud in the roads is purple but in the emerald city everything is green that is purple here and in the country of the munchkins over at the east everything is blue and in the south country of the quadlings everything is red and in the west country of the winkies where the tin woodman rules everything is yellow  oh said jack then after a pause he asked  did you say a tin woodman rules the winkies  yes he was one of those who helped dorothy to destroy the wicked witch of the west and the winkies were so grateful that they invited him to become their ruler—just as the people of the emerald city invited the scarecrow to rule them  dear me said jack i’m getting confused with all this history who is the scarecrow  another friend of dorothy’s replied tip  and who is dorothy  she was a girl that came here from kansas a place in the big outside world she got blown to the land of oz by a cyclone and while she was here the scarecrow and the tin woodman accompanied her on her travels  and where is she now inquired the pumpkinhead  glinda the good who rules the quadlings sent her home again said the boy  oh and what became of the scarecrow  i told you he rules the emerald city answered tip  i thought you said it was ruled by a wonderful wizard objected jack seeming more and more confused  well so i did now pay attention and i’ll explain it said tip speaking slowly and looking the smiling pumpkinhead squarely in the eye dorothy went to the emerald city to ask the wizard to send her back to kansas and the scarecrow and the tin woodman went with her but the wizard couldn’t send her back because he wasn’t so much of a wizard as he might have been and then they got angry at the wizard and threatened to expose him so the wizard made a big balloon and escaped in it and no one has ever seen him since  now that is very interesting history said jack well pleased and i understand it perfectly all but the explanation  i’m glad you do responded tip after the wizard was gone the people of the emerald city made his majesty the scarecrow their king and i have heard that he became a very popular ruler  are we going to see this queer king asked jack with interest  i think we may as well replied the boy unless you have something better to do  oh no dear father said the pumpkinhead i am quite willing to go wherever you please  [illustration  image047]  [illustration  image048]  [illustration  image049]     tip makes an experiment in magic   the boy small and rather delicate in appearance seemed somewhat embarrassed at being called father by the tall awkward pumpkinheaded man but to deny the relationship would involve another long and tedious explanation so he changed the subject by asking abruptly   are you tired  of course not replied the other but he continued after a pause it is quite certain i shall wear out my wooden joints if i keep on walking  tip reflected as they journeyed on that this was true he began to regret that he had not constructed the wooden limbs more carefully and substantially yet how could he ever have guessed that the man he had made merely to scare old mombi with would be brought to life by means of a magical powder contained in an old pepper-box  so he ceased to reproach himself and began to think how he might yet remedy the deficiencies of jack’s weak joints  while thus engaged they came to the edge of a wood and the boy sat down to rest upon an old sawhorse that some woodcutter had left there  why don’t you sit down he asked the pumpkinhead  won’t it strain my joints inquired the other  of course not it’ll rest them declared the boy  so jack tried to sit down but as soon as he bent his joints farther than usual they gave way altogether and he came clattering to the ground with such a crash that tip feared he was entirely ruined  [illustration  image050]  he rushed to the man lifted him to his feet straightened his arms and legs and felt of his head to see if by chance it had become cracked but jack seemed to be in pretty good shape after all and tip said to him   i guess you’d better remain standing hereafter it seems the safest way  very well dear father just as you say replied the smiling jack who had been in no wise confused by his tumble  tip sat down again presently the pumpkinhead asked   what is that thing you are sitting on  oh this is a horse replied the boy carelessly  what is a horse demanded jack  a horse why there are two kinds of horses returned tip slightly puzzled how to explain one kind of horse is alive and has four legs and a head and a tail and people ride upon its back  i understand said jack cheerfully that’s the kind of horse you are now sitting on  no it isn’t answered tip promptly  why not that one has four legs and a head and a tail tip looked at the saw-horse more carefully and found that the pumpkinhead was right the body had been formed from a tree-trunk and a branch had been left sticking up at one end that looked very much like a tail in the other end were two big knots that resembled eyes and a place had been chopped away that might easily be mistaken for the horse’s mouth as for the legs they were four straight limbs cut from trees and stuck fast into the body being spread wide apart so that the saw-horse would stand firmly when a log was laid across it to be sawed  this thing resembles a real horse more than i imagined said tip trying to explain but a real horse is alive and trots and prances and eats oats while this is nothing more than a dead horse made of wood and used to saw logs upon  if it were alive wouldn’t it trot and prance and eat oats inquired the pumpkinhead  it would trot and prance perhaps but it wouldn’t eat oats replied the boy laughing at the idea and of course it can’t ever be alive because it is made of wood  so am i answered the man  tip looked at him in surprise  why so you are he exclaimed and the magic powder that brought you to life is here in my pocket  [illustration  image053]  he brought out the pepper box and eyed it curiously  i wonder said he musingly if it would bring the saw-horse to life  if it would returned jack calmly for nothing seemed to surprise him i could ride on its back and that would save my joints from wearing out  i’ll try it cried the boy jumping up but i wonder if i can remember the words old mombi said and the way she held her hands up  he thought it over for a minute and as he had watched carefully from the hedge every motion of the old witch and listened to her words he believed he could repeat exactly what she had said and done  so he began by sprinkling some of the magic powder of life from the pepper-box upon the body of the saw-horse then he lifted his left hand with the little finger pointing upward and said  weaugh  what does that mean dear father asked jack curiously  i don’t know answered tip then he lifted his right hand with the thumb pointing upward and said  teaugh  what’s that dear father inquired jack  it means you must keep quiet replied the boy provoked at being interrupted at so important a moment  how fast i am learning remarked the pumpkinhead with his eternal smile  tip now lifted both hands above his head with all the fingers and thumbs spread out and cried in a loud voice  peaugh  immediately the saw-horse moved stretched its legs yawned with its chopped-out mouth and shook a few grains of the powder off its back the rest of the powder seemed to have vanished into the body of the horse  good called jack while the boy looked on in astonishment you are a very clever sorcerer dear father  [illustration  image055]  [illustration  image056]  [illustration  image057]     the awakening of the saw-horse   the saw-horse finding himself alive seemed even more astonished than tip he rolled his knotty eyes from side to side taking a first wondering view of the world in which he had now so important an existence then he tried to look at himself but he had indeed no neck to turn so that in the endeavor to see his body he kept circling around and around without catching even a glimpse of it his legs were stiff and awkward for there were no knee-joints in them so that presently he bumped against jack pumpkinhead and sent that personage tumbling upon the moss that lined the roadside  tip became alarmed at this accident as well as at the persistence of the saw-horse in prancing around in a circle so he called out   whoa whoa there  the saw-horse paid no attention whatever to this command and the next instant brought one of his wooden legs down upon tip’s foot so forcibly that the boy danced away in pain to a safer distance from where he again yelled   whoa whoa i say  jack had now managed to raise himself to a sitting position and he looked at the saw-horse with much interest  i don’t believe the animal can hear you he remarked  i shout loud enough don’t i answered tip angrily  yes but the horse has no ears said the smiling pumpkinhead  sure enough exclaimed tip noting the fact for the first time how then am i going to stop him  but at that instant the saw-horse stopped himself having concluded it was impossible to see his own body he saw tip however and came close to the boy to observe him more fully  it was really comical to see the creature walk for it moved the legs on its right side together and those on its left side together as a pacing horse does and that made its body rock sidewise like a cradle  tip patted it upon the head and said good boy good boy in a coaxing tone and the saw-horse pranced away to examine with its bulging eyes the form of jack pumpkinhead  i must find a halter for him said tip and having made a search in his pocket he produced a roll of strong cord unwinding this he approached the saw-horse and tied the cord around its neck afterward fastening the other end to a large tree the saw-horse not understanding the action stepped backward and snapped the string easily but it made no attempt to run away  he’s stronger than i thought said the boy and rather obstinate too  why don’t you make him some ears asked jack then you can tell him what to do  that’s a splendid idea said tip how did you happen to think of it  why i didn’t think of it answered the pumpkinhead i didn’t need to for it’s the simplest and easiest thing to do  so tip got out his knife and fashioned some ears out of the bark of a small tree  i mustn’t make them too big he said as he whittled or our horse would become a donkey  how is that inquired jack from the roadside  why a horse has bigger ears than a man and a donkey has bigger ears than a horse explained tip  then if my ears were longer would i be a horse asked jack  my friend said tip gravely you’ll never be anything but a pumpkinhead no matter how big your ears are  oh returned jack nodding i think i understand  if you do you’re a wonder remarked the boy but there’s no harm in thinking you understand i guess these ears are ready now will you hold the horse while i stick them on  certainly if you’ll help me up said jack  so tip raised him to his feet and the pumpkinhead went to the horse and held its head while the boy bored two holes in it with his knife-blade and inserted the ears  they make him look very handsome said jack admiringly  but those words spoken close to the saw-horse and being the first sounds he had ever heard so startled the animal that he made a bound forward and tumbled tip on one side and jack on the other then he continued to rush forward as if frightened by the clatter of his own foot-steps  whoa shouted tip picking himself up whoa you idiot whoa the saw-horse would probably have paid no attention to this but just then it stepped a leg into a gopher-hole and stumbled head-over-heels to the ground where it lay upon its back frantically waving its four legs in the air  tip ran up to it  you’re a nice sort of a horse i must say he exclaimed why didn’t you stop when i yelled ‘whoa’  does ‘whoa’ mean to stop asked the saw-horse in a surprised voice as it rolled its eyes upward to look at the boy  of course it does answered tip  and a hole in the ground means to stop also doesn’t it continued the horse  to be sure unless you step over it said tip  what a strange place this is the creature exclaimed as if amazed what am i doing here anyway  why i’ve brought you to life answered the boy but it won’t hurt you any if you mind me and do as i tell you  then i will do as you tell me replied the saw-horse humbly but what happened to me a moment ago i don’t seem to be just right someway  [illustration  image062]  you’re upside down explained tip but just keep those legs still a minute and i’ll set you right side up again  how many sides have i asked the creature wonderingly  several said tip briefly but do keep those legs still  the saw-horse now became quiet and held its legs rigid so that tip after several efforts was able to roll him over and set him upright  ah i seem all right now said the queer animal with a sigh  one of your ears is broken tip announced after a careful examination i’ll have to make a new one  then he led the saw-horse back to where jack was vainly struggling to regain his feet and after assisting the pumpkinhead to stand upright tip whittled out a new ear and fastened it to the horse’s head  now said he addressing his steed pay attention to what i’m going to tell you ‘whoa’ means to stop ‘get-up’ means to walk forward ‘trot’ means to go as fast as you can understand  i believe i do returned the horse  very good we are all going on a journey to the emerald city to see his majesty the scarecrow and jack pumpkinhead is going to ride on your back so he won’t wear out his joints  i don’t mind said the saw-horse anything that suits you suits me  then tip assisted jack to get upon the horse  hold on tight he cautioned or you may fall off and crack your pumpkin head  that would be horrible said jack with a shudder what shall i hold on to  why hold on to his ears replied tip after a moment’s hesitation  don’t do that remonstrated the saw-horse for then i can’t hear  that seemed reasonable so tip tried to think of something else  i’ll fix it said he at length he went into the wood and cut a short length of limb from a young stout tree one end of this he sharpened to a point and then he dug a hole in the back of the saw-horse just behind its head next he brought a piece of rock from the road and hammered the post firmly into the animal’s back  stop stop shouted the horse you’re jarring me terribly  [illustration  image065]  does it hurt asked the boy  not exactly hurt answered the animal but it makes me quite nervous to be jarred  well it’s all over now said tip encouragingly now jack be sure to hold fast to this post and then you can’t fall off and get smashed  so jack held on tight and tip said to the horse   get up  the obedient creature at once walked forward rocking from side to side as he raised his feet from the ground  tip walked beside the saw-horse quite content with this addition to their party presently he began to whistle  what does that sound mean asked the horse  don’t pay any attention to it said tip i’m just whistling and that only means i’m pretty well satisfied  i’d whistle myself if i could push my lips together remarked jack i fear dear father that in some respects i am sadly lacking  [illustration  image067]  after journeying on for some distance the narrow path they were following turned into a broad roadway paved with yellow brick by the side of the road tip noticed a sign-post that read   nine miles to the emerald city  but it was now growing dark so he decided to camp for the night by the roadside and to resume the journey next morning by daybreak he led the saw-horse to a grassy mound upon which grew several bushy trees and carefully assisted the pumpkinhead to alight  i think i’ll lay you upon the ground overnight said the boy you will be safer that way  how about me asked the saw-horse  it won’t hurt you to stand replied tip and as you can’t sleep you may as well watch out and see that no one comes near to disturb us  then the boy stretched himself upon the grass beside the pumpkinhead and being greatly wearied by the journey was soon fast asleep  [illustration  image069]  [illustration  image070]  [illustration  image071]     jack pumpkinhead’s ride to the emerald city   at daybreak tip was awakened by the pumpkinhead he rubbed the sleep from his eyes bathed in a little brook and then ate a portion of his bread and cheese having thus prepared for a new day the boy said   let us start at once nine miles is quite a distance but we ought to reach the emerald city by noon if no accidents happen so the pumpkinhead was again perched upon the back of the saw-horse and the journey was resumed  tip noticed that the purple tint of the grass and trees had now faded to a dull lavender and before long this lavender appeared to take on a greenish tinge that gradually brightened as they drew nearer to the great city where the scarecrow ruled  the little party had traveled but a short two miles upon their way when the road of yellow brick was parted by a broad and swift river tip was puzzled how to cross over but after a time he discovered a man in a ferry-boat approaching from the other side of the stream  when the man reached the bank tip asked   will you row us to the other side  yes if you have money returned the ferryman whose face looked cross and disagreeable  but i have no money said tip  none at all inquired the man  none at all answered the boy  then i’ll not break my back rowing you over said the ferryman decidedly  what a nice man remarked the pumpkinhead smilingly  the ferryman stared at him but made no reply tip was trying to think for it was a great disappointment to him to find his journey so suddenly brought to an end  i must certainly get to the emerald city he said to the boatman but how can i cross the river if you do not take me  the man laughed and it was not a nice laugh  that wooden horse will float said he and you can ride him across as for the pumpkinheaded loon who accompanies you let him sink or swim it won’t matter greatly which  [illustration  image073]  don’t worry about me said jack smiling pleasantly upon the crabbed ferryman i’m sure i ought to float beautifully  tip thought the experiment was worth making and the saw-horse who did not know what danger meant offered no objections whatever so the boy led it down into the water and climbed upon its back jack also waded in up to his knees and grasped the tail of the horse so that he might keep his pumpkin head above the water  now said tip instructing the saw-horse if you wiggle your legs you will probably swim and if you swim we shall probably reach the other side  the saw-horse at once began to wiggle its legs which acted as oars and moved the adventurers slowly across the river to the opposite side so successful was the trip that presently they were climbing wet and dripping up the grassy bank  tip’s trouser-legs and shoes were thoroughly soaked but the saw-horse had floated so perfectly that from his knees up the boy was entirely dry as for the pumpkinhead every stitch of his gorgeous clothing dripped water  the sun will soon dry us said tip and anyhow we are now safely across in spite of the ferryman and can continue our journey  i didn’t mind swimming at all remarked the horse  nor did i added jack  they soon regained the road of yellow brick which proved to be a continuation of the road they had left on the other side and then tip once more mounted the pumpkinhead upon the back of the saw-horse  if you ride fast said he the wind will help to dry your clothing i will hold on to the horse’s tail and run after you in this way we all will become dry in a very short time  then the horse must step lively said jack  i’ll do my best returned the saw-horse cheerfully  tip grasped the end of the branch that served as tail to the saw-horse and called loudly  get-up  the horse started at a good pace and tip followed behind then he decided they could go faster so he shouted  trot  [illustration  image075]  now the saw-horse remembered that this word was the command to go as fast as he could so he began rocking along the road at a tremendous pace and tip had hard work—running faster than he ever had before in his life—to keep his feet  soon he was out of breath and although he wanted to call whoa to the horse he found he could not get the word out of his throat then the end of the tail he was clutching being nothing more than a dead branch suddenly broke away and the next minute the boy was rolling in the dust of the road while the horse and its pumpkin-headed rider dashed on and quickly disappeared in the distance  by the time tip had picked himself up and cleared the dust from his throat so he could say whoa there was no further need of saying it for the horse was long since out of sight  so he did the only sensible thing he could do he sat down and took a good rest and afterward began walking along the road  some time i will surely overtake them he reflected for the road will end at the gates of the emerald city and they can go no further than that  meantime jack was holding fast to the post and the saw-horse was tearing along the road like a racer neither of them knew tip was left behind for the pumpkinhead did not look around and the saw-horse couldn’t  as he rode jack noticed that the grass and trees had become a bright emerald-green in color so he guessed they were nearing the emerald city even before the tall spires and domes came into sight  at length a high wall of green stone studded thick with emeralds loomed up before them and fearing the saw-horse would not know enough to stop and so might smash them both against this wall jack ventured to cry whoa as loud as he could  so suddenly did the horse obey that had it not been for his post jack would have been pitched off head foremost and his beautiful face ruined  that was a fast ride dear father he exclaimed and then hearing no reply he turned around and discovered for the first time that tip was not there  this apparent desertion puzzled the pumpkinhead and made him uneasy and while he was wondering what had become of the boy and what he ought to do next under such trying circumstances the gateway in the green wall opened and a man came out  this man was short and round with a fat face that seemed remarkably good-natured he was clothed all in green and wore a high peaked green hat upon his head and green spectacles over his eyes bowing before the pumpkinhead he said   i am the guardian of the gates of the emerald city may i inquire who you are and what is your business  my name is jack pumpkinhead returned the other smilingly but as to my business i haven’t the least idea in the world what it is  the guardian of the gates looked surprised and shook his head as if dissatisfied with the reply  what are you a man or a pumpkin he asked politely  both if you please answered jack  and this wooden horse—is it alive questioned the guardian  the horse rolled one knotty eye upward and winked at jack then it gave a prance and brought one leg down on the guardian’s toes  ouch cried the man i’m sorry i asked that question but the answer is most convincing have you any errand sir in the emerald city  it seems to me that i have replied the pumpkinhead seriously but i cannot think what it is my father knows all about it but he is not here  this is a strange affair very strange declared the guardian but you seem harmless folks do not smile so delightfully when they mean mischief  as for that said jack i cannot help my smile for it is carved on my face with a jack-knife  well come with me into my room resumed the guardian and i will see what can be done for you  so jack rode the saw-horse through the gateway into a little room built into the wall the guardian pulled a bell-cord and presently a very tall soldier—clothed in a green uniform—entered from the opposite door this soldier carried a long green gun over his shoulder and had lovely green whiskers that fell quite to his knees the guardian at once addressed him saying   here is a strange gentleman who doesn’t know why he has come to the emerald city or what he wants tell me what shall we do with him  the soldier with the green whiskers looked at jack with much care and curiosity finally he shook his head so positively that little waves rippled down his whiskers and then he said   i must take him to his majesty the scarecrow  but what will his majesty the scarecrow do with him asked the guardian of the gates  that is his majesty’s business returned the soldier i have troubles enough of my own all outside troubles must be turned over to his majesty so put the spectacles on this fellow and i’ll take him to the royal palace  so the guardian opened a big box of spectacles and tried to fit a pair to jack’s great round eyes  i haven’t a pair in stock that will really cover those eyes up said the little man with a sigh and your head is so big that i shall be obliged to tie the spectacles on  but why need i wear spectacles asked jack  [illustration  image081]  it’s the fashion here said the soldier and they will keep you from being blinded by the glitter and glare of the gorgeous emerald city  oh exclaimed jack tie them on by all means i don’t wish to be blinded  nor i broke in the saw-horse so a pair of green spectacles was quickly fastened over the bulging knots that served it for eyes  then the soldier with the green whiskers led them through the inner gate and they at once found themselves in the main street of the magnificent emerald city  sparkling green gems ornamented the fronts of the beautiful houses and the towers and turrets were all faced with emeralds even the green marble pavement glittered with precious stones and it was indeed a grand and marvelous sight to one who beheld it for the first time  however the pumpkinhead and the saw-horse knowing nothing of wealth and beauty paid little attention to the wonderful sights they saw through their green spectacles they calmly followed after the green soldier and scarcely noticed the crowds of green people who stared at them in surprise when a green dog ran out and barked at them the saw-horse promptly kicked at it with its wooden leg and sent the little animal howling into one of the houses but nothing more serious than this happened to interrupt their progress to the royal palace  the pumpkinhead wanted to ride up the green marble steps and straight into the scarecrow’s presence but the soldier would not permit that so jack dismounted with much difficulty and a servant led the saw-horse around to the rear while the soldier with the green whiskers escorted the pumpkinhead into the palace by the front entrance  the stranger was left in a handsomely furnished waiting room while the soldier went to announce him it so happened that at this hour his majesty was at leisure and greatly bored for want of something to do so he ordered his visitor to be shown at once into his throne room  jack felt no fear or embarrassment at meeting the ruler of this magnificent city for he was entirely ignorant of all worldly customs but when he entered the room and saw for the first time his majesty the scarecrow seated upon his glittering throne he stopped short in amazement  [illustration  image084]  [illustration  image085]     his majesty the scarecrow   i suppose every reader of this book knows what a scarecrow is but jack pumpkinhead never having seen such a creation was more surprised at meeting the remarkable king of the emerald city than by any other one experience of his brief life  his majesty the scarecrow was dressed in a suit of faded blue clothes and his head was merely a small sack stuffed with straw upon which eyes ears a nose and a mouth had been rudely painted to represent a face the clothes were also stuffed with straw and that so unevenly or carelessly that his majesty’s legs and arms seemed more bumpy than was necessary upon his hands were gloves with long fingers and these were padded with cotton wisps of straw stuck out from the monarch’s coat and also from his neck and boot-tops upon his head he wore a heavy golden crown set thick with sparkling jewels and the weight of this crown caused his brow to sag in wrinkles giving a thoughtful expression to the painted face indeed the crown alone betokened majesty in all else the scarecrow king was but a simple scarecrow—flimsy awkward and unsubstantial  but if the strange appearance of his majesty the scarecrow seemed startling to jack no less wonderful was the form of the pumpkinhead to the scarecrow the purple trousers and pink waistcoat and red shirt hung loosely over the wooden joints tip had manufactured and the carved face on the pumpkin grinned perpetually as if its wearer considered life the jolliest thing imaginable  at first indeed his majesty thought his queer visitor was laughing at him and was inclined to resent such a liberty but it was not without reason that the scarecrow had attained the reputation of being the wisest personage in the land of oz he made a more careful examination of his visitor and soon discovered that jack’s features were carved into a smile and that he could not look grave if he wished to  [illustration  image087]  the king was the first to speak after regarding jack for some minutes he said in a tone of wonder   where on earth did you come from and how do you happen to be alive  i beg your majesty’s pardon returned the pumpkinhead but i do not understand you  what don’t you understand asked the scarecrow  why i don’t understand your language you see i came from the country of the gillikins so that i am a foreigner  ah to be sure exclaimed the scarecrow i myself speak the language of the munchkins which is also the language of the emerald city but you i suppose speak the language of the pumpkinheads  exactly so your majesty replied the other bowing so it will be impossible for us to understand one another  that is unfortunate certainly said the scarecrow thoughtfully we must have an interpreter  what is an interpreter asked jack  a person who understands both my language and your own when i say anything the interpreter can tell you what i mean and when you say anything the interpreter can tell me what you mean for the interpreter can speak both languages as well as understand them  that is certainly clever said jack greatly pleased at finding so simple a way out of the difficulty  so the scarecrow commanded the soldier with the green whiskers to search among his people until he found one who understood the language of the gillikins as well as the language of the emerald city and to bring that person to him at once  when the soldier had departed the scarecrow said   won’t you take a chair while we are waiting  [illustration  image090]  your majesty forgets that i cannot understand you replied the pumpkinhead if you wish me to sit down you must make a sign for me to do so the scarecrow came down from his throne and rolled an armchair to a position behind the pumpkinhead then he gave jack a sudden push that sent him sprawling upon the cushions in so awkward a fashion that he doubled up like a jackknife and had hard work to untangle himself  did you understand that sign asked his majesty politely  perfectly declared jack reaching up his arms to turn his head to the front the pumpkin having twisted around upon the stick that supported it  you seem hastily made remarked the scarecrow watching jack’s efforts to straighten himself  not more so than your majesty was the frank reply  there is this difference between us said the scarecrow that whereas i will bend but not break you will break but not bend  at this moment the soldier returned leading a young girl by the hand she seemed very sweet and modest having a pretty face and beautiful green eyes and hair a dainty green silk skirt reached to her knees showing silk stockings embroidered with pea-pods and green satin slippers with bunches of lettuce for decorations instead of bows or buckles upon her silken waist clover leaves were embroidered and she wore a jaunty little jacket trimmed with sparkling emeralds of a uniform size  why it’s little jellia jamb exclaimed the scarecrow as the green maiden bowed her pretty head before him do you understand the language of the gillikins my dear  yes your majesty she answered for i was born in the north country  then you shall be our interpreter said the scarecrow and explain to this pumpkinhead all that i say and also explain to me all that he says is this arrangement satisfactory he asked turning toward his guest  very satisfactory indeed was the reply  then ask him to begin with resumed the scarecrow turning to jellia what brought him to the emerald city  but instead of this the girl who had been staring at jack said to him   you are certainly a wonderful creature who made you  a boy named tip answered jack  what does he say inquired the scarecrow my ears must have deceived me what did he say  he says that your majesty’s brains seem to have come loose replied the girl demurely  the scarecrow moved uneasily upon his throne and felt of his head with his left hand  what a fine thing it is to understand two different languages he said with a perplexed sigh ask him my dear if he has any objection to being put in jail for insulting the ruler of the emerald city  i didn’t insult you protested jack indignantly  tut—tut cautioned the scarecrow wait until jellia translates my speech what have we got an interpreter for if you break out in this rash way  all right i’ll wait replied the pumpkinhead in a surly tone—although his face smiled as genially as ever translate the speech young woman  his majesty inquires if you are hungry said jellia  oh not at all answered jack more pleasantly for it is impossible for me to eat  it’s the same way with me remarked the scarecrow what did he say jellia my dear  he asked if you were aware that one of your eyes is painted larger than the other said the girl mischievously  [illustration  image093]  don’t you believe her your majesty cried jack  oh i don’t answered the scarecrow calmly then casting a sharp look at the girl he asked   are you quite certain you understand the languages of both the gillikins and the munchkins  quite certain your majesty said jellia jamb trying hard not to laugh in the face of royalty  then how is it that i seem to understand them myself inquired the scarecrow  because they are one and the same declared the girl now laughing merrily does not your majesty know that in all the land of oz but one language is spoken  is it indeed so cried the scarecrow much relieved to hear this then i might easily have been my own interpreter  it was all my fault your majesty said jack looking rather foolish i thought we must surely speak different languages since we came from different countries  this should be a warning to you never to think returned the scarecrow severely for unless one can think wisely it is better to remain a dummy—which you most certainly are  i am—i surely am agreed the pumpkinhead  it seems to me continued the scarecrow more mildly that your manufacturer spoiled some good pies to create an indifferent man  i assure your majesty that i did not ask to be created answered jack  ah it was the same in my case said the king pleasantly and so as we differ from all ordinary people let us become friends  with all my heart exclaimed jack  what have you a heart asked the scarecrow surprised  no that was only imaginative—i might say a figure of speech said the other  well your most prominent figure seems to be a figure of wood so i must beg you to restrain an imagination which having no brains you have no right to exercise suggested the scarecrow warningly  to be sure said jack without in the least comprehending  his majesty then dismissed jellia jamb and the soldier with the green whiskers and when they were gone he took his new friend by the arm and led him into the courtyard to play a game of quoits  [illustration  image097]  [illustration  image098]  [illustration  image099]     gen jinjur’s army of revolt   tip was so anxious to rejoin his man jack and the saw-horse that he walked a full half the distance to the emerald city without stopping to rest then he discovered that he was hungry and the crackers and cheese he had provided for the journey had all been eaten  while wondering what he should do in this emergency he came upon a girl sitting by the roadside she wore a costume that struck the boy as being remarkably brilliant  her silken waist being of emerald green and her skirt of four distinct colors—blue in front yellow at the left side red at the back and purple at the right side fastening the waist in front were four buttons—the top one blue the next yellow a third red and the last purple  [illustration  image100]  the splendor of this dress was almost barbaric so tip was fully justified in staring at the gown for some moments before his eyes were attracted by the pretty face above it yes the face was pretty enough he decided but it wore an expression of discontent coupled to a shade of defiance or audacity  while the boy stared the girl looked upon him calmly a lunch basket stood beside her and she held a dainty sandwich in one hand and a hard-boiled egg in the other eating with an evident appetite that aroused tip’s sympathy  he was just about to ask a share of the luncheon when the girl stood up and brushed the crumbs from her lap  there said she it is time for me to go carry that basket for me and help yourself to its contents if you are hungry  tip seized the basket eagerly and began to eat following for a time the strange girl without bothering to ask questions she walked along before him with swift strides and there was about her an air of decision and importance that led him to suspect she was some great personage  finally when he had satisfied his hunger he ran up beside her and tried to keep pace with her swift footsteps—a very difficult feat for she was much taller than he and evidently in a hurry  thank you very much for the sandwiches said tip as he trotted along may i ask your name  i am general jinjur was the brief reply  oh said the boy surprised what sort of a general  i command the army of revolt in this war answered the general with unnecessary sharpness  oh he again exclaimed i didn’t know there was a war  you were not supposed to know it she returned for we have kept it a secret and considering that our army is composed entirely of girls she added with some pride it is surely a remarkable thing that our revolt is not yet discovered  it is indeed acknowledged tip but where is your army  about a mile from here said general jinjur the forces have assembled from all parts of the land of oz at my express command for this is the day we are to conquer his majesty the scarecrow and wrest from him the throne the army of revolt only awaits my coming to march upon the emerald city  well declared tip drawing a long breath this is certainly a surprising thing may i ask why you wish to conquer his majesty the scarecrow  because the emerald city has been ruled by men long enough for one reason said the girl  moreover the city glitters with beautiful gems which might far better be used for rings bracelets and necklaces and there is enough money in the king’s treasury to buy every girl in our army a dozen new gowns so we intend to conquer the city and run the government to suit ourselves  jinjur spoke these words with an eagerness and decision that proved she was in earnest  but war is a terrible thing said tip thoughtfully  this war will be pleasant replied the girl cheerfully  many of you will be slain continued the boy in an awed voice  oh no said jinjur what man would oppose a girl or dare to harm her and there is not an ugly face in my entire army  tip laughed  perhaps you are right said he but the guardian of the gate is considered a faithful guardian and the king’s army will not let the city be conquered without a struggle  the army is old and feeble replied general jinjur scornfully his strength has all been used to grow whiskers and his wife has such a temper that she has already pulled more than half of them out by the roots when the wonderful wizard reigned the soldier with the green whiskers was a very good royal army for people feared the wizard but no one is afraid of the scarecrow so his royal army don’t count for much in time of war  after this conversation they proceeded some distance in silence and before long reached a large clearing in the forest where fully four hundred young women were assembled these were laughing and talking together as gaily as if they had gathered for a picnic instead of a war of conquest  they were divided into four companies and tip noticed that all were dressed in costumes similar to that worn by general jinjur the only real difference was that while those girls from the munchkin country had the blue strip in front of their skirts those from the country of the quadlings had the red strip in front and those from the country of the winkies had the yellow strip in front and the gillikin girls wore the purple strip in front all had green waists representing the emerald city they intended to conquer and the top button on each waist indicated by its color which country the wearer came from the uniforms were jaunty and becoming and quite effective when massed together  tip thought this strange army bore no weapons whatever but in this he was wrong for each girl had stuck through the knot of her back hair two long glittering knitting-needles  general jinjur immediately mounted the stump of a tree and addressed her army  friends fellow-citizens and girls she said we are about to begin our great revolt against the men of oz we march to conquer the emerald city—to dethrone the scarecrow king—to acquire thousands of gorgeous gems—to rifle the royal treasury—and to obtain power over our former oppressors  [illustration  image105]  [illustration  image106]  hurrah said those who had listened but tip thought most of the army was too much engaged in chattering to pay attention to the words of the general  the command to march was now given and the girls formed themselves into four bands or companies and set off with eager strides toward the emerald city  [illustration  image107]  the boy followed after them carrying several baskets and wraps and packages which various members of the army of revolt had placed in his care it was not long before they came to the green granite walls of the city and halted before the gateway  the guardian of the gate at once came out and looked at them curiously as if a circus had come to town he carried a bunch of keys swung round his neck by a golden chain his hands were thrust carelessly into his pockets and he seemed to have no idea at all that the city was threatened by rebels speaking pleasantly to the girls he said   good morning my dears what can i do for you  surrender instantly answered general jinjur standing before him and frowning as terribly as her pretty face would allow her to  surrender echoed the man astounded why it’s impossible it’s against the law i never heard of such a thing in my life  still you must surrender exclaimed the general fiercely we are revolting  you don’t look it said the guardian gazing from one to another admiringly  but we are cried jinjur stamping her foot impatiently and we mean to conquer the emerald city  good gracious returned the surprised guardian of the gates what a nonsensical idea go home to your mothers my good girls and milk the cows and bake the bread don’t you know it’s a dangerous thing to conquer a city  [illustration  image109]  we are not afraid responded the general and she looked so determined that it made the guardian uneasy  so he rang the bell for the soldier with the green whiskers and the next minute was sorry he had done so for immediately he was surrounded by a crowd of girls who drew the knitting-needles from their hair and began jabbing them at the guardian with the sharp points dangerously near his fat cheeks and blinking eyes  the poor man howled loudly for mercy and made no resistance when jinjur drew the bunch of keys from around his neck  followed by her army the general now rushed to the gateway where she was confronted by the royal army of oz—which was the other name for the soldier with the green whiskers  halt he cried and pointed his long gun full in the face of the leader  some of the girls screamed and ran back but general jinjur bravely stood her ground and said reproachfully   why how now would you shoot a poor defenceless girl  no replied the soldier for my gun isn’t loaded  not loaded  no for fear of accidents and i’ve forgotten where i hid the powder and shot to load it with but if you’ll wait a short time i’ll try to hunt them up  don’t trouble yourself said jinjur cheerfully then she turned to her army and cried   girls the gun isn’t loaded  hooray shrieked the rebels delighted at this good news and they proceeded to rush upon the soldier with the green whiskers in such a crowd that it was a wonder they didn’t stick the knitting-needles into one another  but the royal army of oz was too much afraid of women to meet the onslaught he simply turned about and ran with all his might through the gate and toward the royal palace while general jinjur and her mob flocked into the unprotected city  in this way was the emerald city captured without a drop of blood being spilled the army of revolt had become an army of conquerors  [illustration  image111]  [illustration  image112]  [illustration  image113]     the scarecrow plans an escape   tip slipped away from the girls and followed swiftly after the soldier with the green whiskers the invading army entered the city more slowly for they stopped to dig emeralds out of the walls and paving-stones with the points of their knitting-needles so the soldier and the boy reached the palace before the news had spread that the city was conquered  the scarecrow and jack pumpkinhead were still playing at quoits in the courtyard when the game was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of the royal army of oz who came flying in without his hat or gun his clothes in sad disarray and his long beard floating a yard behind him as he ran  tally one for me said the scarecrow calmly what’s wrong my man he added addressing the soldier  oh your majesty—your majesty the city is conquered gasped the royal army who was all out of breath  this is quite sudden said the scarecrow but please go and bar all the doors and windows of the palace while i show this pumpkinhead how to throw a quoit  the soldier hastened to do this while tip who had arrived at his heels remained in the courtyard to look at the scarecrow with wondering eyes  his majesty continued to throw the quoits as coolly as if no danger threatened his throne but the pumpkinhead having caught sight of tip ambled toward the boy as fast as his wooden legs would go  good afternoon noble parent he cried delightedly i’m glad to see you are here that terrible saw-horse ran away with me  i suspected it said tip did you get hurt are you cracked at all  no i arrived safely answered jack and his majesty has been very kind indeed to me  at this moment the soldier with the green whiskers returned and the scarecrow asked   by the way who has conquered me  a regiment of girls gathered from the four corners of the land of oz replied the soldier still pale with fear  but where was my standing army at the time inquired his majesty looking at the soldier gravely  your standing army was running answered the fellow honestly for no man could face the terrible weapons of the invaders  well said the scarecrow after a moment’s thought i don’t mind much the loss of my throne for it’s a tiresome job to rule over the emerald city and this crown is so heavy that it makes my head ache but i hope the conquerors have no intention of injuring me just because i happen to be the king  i heard them say remarked tip with some hesitation that they intend to make a rag carpet of your outside and stuff their sofa-cushions with your inside  then i am really in danger declared his majesty positively and it will be wise for me to consider a means to escape  [illustration  image116]  where can you go asked jack pumpkinhead  why to my friend the tin woodman who rules over the winkies and calls himself their emperor was the answer i am sure he will protect me  tip was looking out the window  the palace is surrounded by the enemy said he it is too late to escape they would soon tear you to pieces  the scarecrow sighed  in an emergency he announced it is always a good thing to pause and reflect please excuse me while i pause and reflect  but we also are in danger said the pumpkinhead anxiously if any of these girls understand cooking my end is not far off  nonsense exclaimed the scarecrow they’re too busy to cook even if they know how  but should i remain here a prisoner for any length of time protested jack i’m liable to spoil  ah then you would not be fit to associate with returned the scarecrow the matter is more serious than i suspected  you said the pumpkinhead gloomily are liable to live for many years my life is necessarily short so i must take advantage of the few days that remain to me  there there don’t worry answered the scarecrow soothingly if you’ll keep quiet long enough for me to think i’ll try to find some way for us all to escape  so the others waited in patient silence while the scarecrow walked to a corner and stood with his face to the wall for a good five minutes at the end of that time he faced them with a more cheerful expression upon his painted face  where is the saw-horse you rode here he asked the pumpkinhead  why i said he was a jewel and so your man locked him up in the royal treasury said jack  it was the only place i could think of your majesty added the soldier fearing he had made a blunder  it pleases me very much said the scarecrow has the animal been fed  oh yes i gave him a heaping peck of sawdust  excellent cried the scarecrow bring the horse here at once  the soldier hastened away and presently they heard the clattering of the horse’s wooden legs upon the pavement as he was led into the courtyard  his majesty regarded the steed critically he doesn’t seem especially graceful he remarked musingly but i suppose he can run  he can indeed said tip gazing upon the saw-horse admiringly  then bearing us upon his back he must make a dash through the ranks of the rebels and carry us to my friend the tin woodman announced the scarecrow  he can’t carry four objected tip  no but he may be induced to carry three said his majesty i shall therefore leave my royal army behind for from the ease with which he was conquered i have little confidence in his powers  still he can run declared tip laughing  i expected this blow said the soldier sulkily but i can bear it i shall disguise myself by cutting off my lovely green whiskers and after all it is no more dangerous to face those reckless girls than to ride this fiery untamed wooden horse  perhaps you are right observed his majesty but for my part not being a soldier i am fond of danger now my boy you must mount first and please sit as close to the horse’s neck as possible  tip climbed quickly to his place and the soldier and the scarecrow managed to hoist the pumpkinhead to a seat just behind him there remained so little space for the king that he was liable to fall off as soon as the horse started  fetch a clothesline said the king to his army and tie us all together then if one falls off we will all fall off  and while the soldier was gone for the clothesline his majesty continued it is well for me to be careful for my very existence is in danger  i have to be as careful as you do said jack  not exactly replied the scarecrow for if anything happened to me that would be the end of me but if anything happened to you they could use you for seed  the soldier now returned with a long line and tied all three firmly together also lashing them to the body of the saw-horse so there seemed little danger of their tumbling off  now throw open the gates commanded the scarecrow and we will make a dash to liberty or to death  [illustration  image121]  the courtyard in which they were standing was located in the center of the great palace which surrounded it on all sides but in one place a passage led to an outer gateway which the soldier had barred by order of his sovereign it was through this gateway his majesty proposed to escape and the royal army now led the saw-horse along the passage and unbarred the gate which swung backward with a loud crash  now said tip to the horse you must save us all run as fast as you can for the gate of the city and don’t let anything stop you  all right answered the saw-horse gruffly and dashed away so suddenly that tip had to gasp for breath and hold firmly to the post he had driven into the creature’s neck  several of the girls who stood outside guarding the palace were knocked over by the saw-horse’s mad rush others ran screaming out of the way and only one or two jabbed their knitting-needles frantically at the escaping prisoners tip got one small prick in his left arm which smarted for an hour afterward but the needles had no effect upon the scarecrow or jack pumpkinhead who never even suspected they were being prodded  as for the saw-horse he made a wonderful record upsetting a fruit cart overturning several meek looking men and finally bowling over the new guardian of the gate—a fussy little fat woman appointed by general jinjur  nor did the impetuous charger stop then once outside the walls of the emerald city he dashed along the road to the west with fast and violent leaps that shook the breath out of the boy and filled the scarecrow with wonder  jack had ridden at this mad rate once before so he devoted every effort to holding with both hands his pumpkin head upon its stick enduring meantime the dreadful jolting with the courage of a philosopher  slow him up slow him up shouted the scarecrow my straw is all shaking down into my legs  but tip had no breath to speak so the saw-horse continued his wild career unchecked and with unabated speed  presently they came to the banks of a wide river and without a pause the wooden steed gave one final leap and launched them all in mid-air  a second later they were rolling splashing and bobbing about in the water the horse struggling frantically to find a rest for its feet and its riders being first plunged beneath the rapid current and then floating upon the surface like corks  [illustration  image123]  [illustration  image124]  [illustration  image125]     the journey to the tin woodman   tip was well soaked and dripping water from every angle of his body but he managed to lean forward and shout in the ear of the saw-horse   keep still you fool keep still  the horse at once ceased struggling and floated calmly upon the surface its wooden body being as buoyant as a raft  what does that word ‘fool’ mean enquired the horse  it is a term of reproach answered tip somewhat ashamed of the expression i only use it when i am angry  then it pleases me to be able to call you a fool in return said the horse for i did not make the river nor put it in our way so only a term of reproach is fit for one who becomes angry with me for falling into the water  that is quite evident replied tip so i will acknowledge myself in the wrong then he called out to the pumpkinhead  are you all right jack  there was no reply so the boy called to the king are you all right your majesty  the scarecrow groaned  i’m all wrong somehow he said in a weak voice how very wet this water is  tip was bound so tightly by the cord that he could not turn his head to look at his companions so he said to the saw-horse   paddle with your legs toward the shore  the horse obeyed and although their progress was slow they finally reached the opposite river bank at a place where it was low enough to enable the creature to scramble upon dry land  with some difficulty the boy managed to get his knife out of his pocket and cut the cords that bound the riders to one another and to the wooden horse he heard the scarecrow fall to the ground with a mushy sound and then he himself quickly dismounted and looked at his friend jack  the wooden body with its gorgeous clothing still sat upright upon the horse’s back but the pumpkin head was gone and only the sharpened stick that served for a neck was visible as for the scarecrow the straw in his body had shaken down with the jolting and packed itself into his legs and the lower part of his body—which appeared very plump and round while his upper half seemed like an empty sack upon his head the scarecrow still wore the heavy crown which had been sewed on to prevent his losing it but the head was now so damp and limp that the weight of the gold and jewels sagged forward and crushed the painted face into a mass of wrinkles that made him look exactly like a japanese pug dog  tip would have laughed—had he not been so anxious about his man jack but the scarecrow however damaged was all there while the pumpkin head that was so necessary to jack’s existence was missing so the boy seized a long pole that fortunately lay near at hand and anxiously turned again toward the river  [illustration  image128]  far out upon the waters he sighted the golden hue of the pumpkin which gently bobbed up and down with the motion of the waves at that moment it was quite out of tip’s reach but after a time it floated nearer and still nearer until the boy was able to reach it with his pole and draw it to the shore then he brought it to the top of the bank carefully wiped the water from its pumpkin face with his handkerchief and ran with it to jack and replaced the head upon the man’s neck  dear me were jack’s first words what a dreadful experience i wonder if water is liable to spoil pumpkins  tip did not think a reply was necessary for he knew that the scarecrow also stood in need of his help so he carefully removed the straw from the king’s body and legs and spread it out in the sun to dry the wet clothing he hung over the body of the saw-horse  if water spoils pumpkins observed jack with a deep sigh then my days are numbered  i’ve never noticed that water spoils pumpkins returned tip unless the water happens to be boiling if your head isn’t cracked my friend you must be in fairly good condition  oh my head isn’t cracked in the least declared jack more cheerfully  then don’t worry retorted the boy care once killed a cat  then said jack seriously i am very glad indeed that i am not a cat  the sun was fast drying their clothing and tip stirred up his majesty’s straw so that the warm rays might absorb the moisture and make it as crisp and dry as ever when this had been accomplished he stuffed the scarecrow into symmetrical shape and smoothed out his face so that he wore his usual gay and charming expression  thank you very much said the monarch brightly as he walked about and found himself to be well balanced there are several distinct advantages in being a scarecrow for if one has friends near at hand to repair damages nothing very serious can happen to you  i wonder if hot sunshine is liable to crack pumpkins said jack with an anxious ring in his voice  not at all—not at all replied the scarecrow gaily all you need fear my boy is old age when your golden youth has decayed we shall quickly part company—but you needn’t look forward to it we’ll discover the fact ourselves and notify you but come let us resume our journey i am anxious to greet my friend the tin woodman  so they remounted the saw-horse tip holding to the post the pumpkinhead clinging to tip and the scarecrow with both arms around the wooden form of jack  [illustration  image131]  go slowly for now there is no danger of pursuit said tip to his steed  all right responded the creature in a voice rather gruff  aren’t you a little hoarse asked the pumpkinhead politely  the saw-horse gave an angry prance and rolled one knotty eye backward toward tip  see here he growled can’t you protect me from insult  to be sure answered tip soothingly i am sure jack meant no harm and it will not do for us to quarrel you know we must all remain good friends  i’ll have nothing more to do with that pumpkinhead declared the saw-horse viciously he loses his head too easily to suit me  there seemed no fitting reply to this speech so for a time they rode along in silence  after a while the scarecrow remarked   this reminds me of old times it was upon this grassy knoll that i once saved dorothy from the stinging bees of the wicked witch of the west  do stinging bees injure pumpkins asked jack glancing around fearfully  they are all dead so it doesn’t matter replied the scarecrow and here is where nick chopper destroyed the wicked witch’s grey wolves  who was nick chopper asked tip  that is the name of my friend the tin woodman answered his majesty and here is where the winged monkeys captured and bound us and flew away with little dorothy he continued after they had traveled a little way farther  do winged monkeys ever eat pumpkins asked jack with a shiver of fear  i do not know but you have little cause to worry for the winged monkeys are now the slaves of glinda the good who owns the golden cap that commands their services said the scarecrow reflectively  then the stuffed monarch became lost in thought recalling the days of past adventures and the saw-horse rocked and rolled over the flower-strewn fields and carried its riders swiftly upon their way  twilight fell bye and bye and then the dark shadows of night so tip stopped the horse and they all proceeded to dismount  i’m tired out said the boy yawning wearily and the grass is soft and cool let us lie down here and sleep until morning  i can’t sleep said jack  i never do said the scarecrow  i do not even know what sleep is said the saw-horse  still we must have consideration for this poor boy who is made of flesh and blood and bone and gets tired suggested the scarecrow in his usual thoughtful manner i remember it was the same way with little dorothy we always had to sit through the night while she slept  i’m sorry said tip meekly but i can’t help it and i’m dreadfully hungry too  here is a new danger remarked jack gloomily i hope you are not fond of eating pumpkins  not unless they’re stewed and made into pies answered the boy laughing so have no fears of me friend jack  what a coward that pumpkinhead is said the saw-horse scornfully  you might be a coward yourself if you knew you were liable to spoil retorted jack angrily  there—there interrupted the scarecrow don’t let us quarrel we all have our weaknesses dear friends so we must strive to be considerate of one another and since this poor boy is hungry and has nothing whatever to eat let us all remain quiet and allow him to sleep for it is said that in sleep a mortal may forget even hunger  thank you exclaimed tip gratefully your majesty is fully as good as you are wise—and that is saying a good deal  he then stretched himself upon the grass and using the stuffed form of the scarecrow for a pillow was presently fast asleep  [illustration  image135]  [illustration  image136]  [illustration  image137]     a nickel-plated emperor   tip awoke soon after dawn but the scarecrow had already risen and plucked with his clumsy fingers a double-handful of ripe berries from some bushes near by these the boy ate greedily finding them an ample breakfast and afterward the little party resumed its journey  after an hour’s ride they reached the summit of a hill from whence they espied the city of the winkies and noted the tall domes of the emperor’s palace rising from the clusters of more modest dwellings  the scarecrow became greatly animated at this sight and exclaimed   how delighted i shall be to see my old friend the tin woodman again i hope that he rules his people more successfully than i have ruled mine  is the tin woodman the emperor of the winkies asked the horse  yes indeed they invited him to rule over them soon after the wicked witch was destroyed and as nick chopper has the best heart in all the world i am sure he has proved an excellent and able emperor  i thought that ‘emperor’ was the title of a person who rules an empire said tip and the country of the winkies is only a kingdom  don’t mention that to the tin woodman exclaimed the scarecrow earnestly you would hurt his feelings terribly he is a proud man as he has every reason to be and it pleases him to be termed emperor rather than king  i’m sure it makes no difference to me replied the boy  the saw-horse now ambled forward at a pace so fast that its riders had hard work to stick upon its back so there was little further conversation until they drew up beside the palace steps  an aged winkie dressed in a uniform of silver cloth came forward to assist them to alight said the scarecrow to his personage   show us at once to your master the emperor  the man looked from one to another of the party in an embarrassed way and finally answered   i fear i must ask you to wait for a time the emperor is not receiving this morning  how is that enquired the scarecrow anxiously i hope nothing has happened to him  oh no nothing serious returned the man but this is his majesty’s day for being polished and just now his august presence is thickly smeared with putz-pomade  oh i see cried the scarecrow greatly reassured my friend was ever inclined to be a dandy and i suppose he is now more proud than ever of his personal appearance  he is indeed said the man with a polite bow our mighty emperor has lately caused himself to be nickel-plated  good gracious the scarecrow exclaimed at hearing this if his wit bears the same polish how sparkling it must be but show us in—i’m sure the emperor will receive us even in his present state  the emperor’s state is always magnificent said the man but i will venture to tell him of your arrival and will receive his commands concerning you  so the party followed the servant into a splendid ante-room and the saw-horse ambled awkwardly after them having no knowledge that a horse might be expected to remain outside  the travelers were at first somewhat awed by their surroundings and even the scarecrow seemed impressed as he examined the rich hangings of silver cloth caught up into knots and fastened with tiny silver axes upon a handsome center-table stood a large silver oil-can richly engraved with scenes from the past adventures of the tin woodman dorothy the cowardly lion and the scarecrow  the lines of the engraving being traced upon the silver in yellow gold on the walls hung several portraits that of the scarecrow seeming to be the most prominent and carefully executed while a the large painting of the famous wizard of oz in act of presenting the tin woodman with a heart covered almost one entire end of the room  while the visitors gazed at these things in silent admiration they suddenly heard a loud voice in the next room exclaim   well well well what a great surprise  and then the door burst open and nick chopper rushed into their midst and caught the scarecrow in a close and loving embrace that creased him into many folds and wrinkles  [illustration  image141]  my dear old friend my noble comrade cried the tin woodman joyfully how delighted i am to meet you once again  and then he released the scarecrow and held him at arms’ length while he surveyed the beloved painted features  but alas the face of the scarecrow and many portions of his body bore great blotches of putz-pomade for the tin woodman in his eagerness to welcome his friend had quite forgotten the condition of his toilet and had rubbed the thick coating of paste from his own body to that of his comrade  dear me said the scarecrow dolefully what a mess i’m in  never mind my friend returned the tin woodman i’ll send you to my imperial laundry and you’ll come out as good as new  won’t i be mangled asked the scarecrow  no indeed was the reply but tell me how came your majesty here and who are your companions  the scarecrow with great politeness introduced tip and jack pumpkinhead and the latter personage seemed to interest the tin woodman greatly  you are not very substantial i must admit said the emperor but you are certainly unusual and therefore worthy to become a member of our select society  [illustration  image143]  i thank your majesty said jack humbly  i hope you are enjoying good health continued the woodman  at present yes replied the pumpkinhead with a sigh but i am in constant terror of the day when i shall spoil  nonsense said the emperor—but in a kindly sympathetic tone do not i beg of you dampen today’s sun with the showers of tomorrow for before your head has time to spoil you can have it canned and in that way it may be preserved indefinitely  tip during this conversation was looking at the woodman with undisguised amazement and noticed that the celebrated emperor of the winkies was composed entirely of pieces of tin neatly soldered and riveted together into the form of a man he rattled and clanked a little as he moved but in the main he seemed to be most cleverly constructed and his appearance was only marred by the thick coating of polishing-paste that covered him from head to foot  the boy’s intent gaze caused the tin woodman to remember that he was not in the most presentable condition so he begged his friends to excuse him while he retired to his private apartment and allowed his servants to polish him this was accomplished in a short time and when the emperor returned his nickel-plated body shone so magnificently that the scarecrow heartily congratulated him on his improved appearance  that nickel-plate was i confess a happy thought said nick and it was the more necessary because i had become somewhat scratched during my adventurous experiences you will observe this engraved star upon my left breast it not only indicates where my excellent heart lies but covers very neatly the patch made by the wonderful wizard when he placed that valued organ in my breast with his own skillful hands  is your heart then a hand-organ asked the pumpkinhead curiously  by no means responded the emperor with dignity it is i am convinced a strictly orthodox heart although somewhat larger and warmer than most people possess  then he turned to the scarecrow and asked   are your subjects happy and contented my dear friend  i cannot say was the reply for the girls of oz have risen in revolt and driven me out of the emerald city  great goodness cried the tin woodman what a calamity they surely do not complain of your wise and gracious rule  no but they say it is a poor rule that don’t work both ways answered the scarecrow and these females are also of the opinion that men have ruled the land long enough so they have captured my city robbed the treasury of all its jewels and are running things to suit themselves  dear me what an extraordinary idea cried the emperor who was both shocked and surprised  and i heard some of them say said tip that they intend to march here and capture the castle and city of the tin woodman  ah we must not give them time to do that said the emperor quickly we will go at once and recapture the emerald city and place the scarecrow again upon his throne  i was sure you would help me remarked the scarecrow in a pleased voice how large an army can you assemble  we do not need an army replied the woodman we four with the aid of my gleaming axe are enough to strike terror into the hearts of the rebels  we five corrected the pumpkinhead  five repeated the tin woodman  yes the saw-horse is brave and fearless answered jack forgetting his recent quarrel with the quadruped  the tin woodman looked around him in a puzzled way for the saw-horse had until now remained quietly standing in a corner where the emperor had not noticed him tip immediately called the odd-looking creature to them and it approached so awkwardly that it nearly upset the beautiful center-table and the engraved oil-can  i begin to think remarked the tin woodman as he looked earnestly at the saw-horse that wonders will never cease how came this creature alive  i did it with a magic powder modestly asserted the boy and the saw-horse has been very useful to us  he enabled us to escape the rebels added the scarecrow  then we must surely accept him as a comrade declared the emperor a live saw-horse is a distinct novelty and should prove an interesting study does he know anything  well i cannot claim any great experience in life the saw-horse answered for himself but i seem to learn very quickly and often it occurs to me that i know more than any of those around me  perhaps you do said the emperor for experience does not always mean wisdom but time is precious just now so let us quickly make preparations to start upon our journey  [illustration  image146]  the emperor called his lord high chancellor and instructed him how to run the kingdom during his absence meanwhile the scarecrow was taken apart and the painted sack that served him for a head was carefully laundered and restuffed with the brains originally given him by the great wizard his clothes were also cleaned and pressed by the imperial tailors and his crown polished and again sewed upon his head for the tin woodman insisted he should not renounce this badge of royalty the scarecrow now presented a very respectable appearance and although in no way addicted to vanity he was quite pleased with himself and strutted a trifle as he walked while this was being done tip mended the wooden limbs of jack pumpkinhead and made them stronger than before and the saw-horse was also inspected to see if he was in good working order  then bright and early the next morning they set out upon the return journey to the emerald city the tin woodman bearing upon his shoulder a gleaming axe and leading the way while the pumpkinhead rode upon the saw-horse and tip and the scarecrow walked upon either side to make sure that he didn’t fall off or become damaged  [illustration  image149]  [illustration  image150]  [illustration  image152]     mr h m woggle-bug t e   now general jinjur—who you will remember commanded the army of revolt—was rendered very uneasy by the escape of the scarecrow from the emerald city she feared and with good reason that if his majesty and the tin woodman joined forces it would mean danger to her and her entire army for the people of oz had not yet forgotten the deeds of these famous heroes who had passed successfully through so many startling adventures  so jinjur sent post-haste for old mombi the witch and promised her large rewards if she would come to the assistance of the rebel army  mombi was furious at the trick tip had played upon her as well as at his escape and the theft of the precious powder of life so she needed no urging to induce her to travel to the emerald city to assist jinjur in defeating the scarecrow and the tin woodman who had made tip one of their friends  mombi had no sooner arrived at the royal palace than she discovered by means of her secret magic that the adventurers were starting upon their journey to the emerald city so she retired to a small room high up in a tower and locked herself in while she practised such arts as she could command to prevent the return of the scarecrow and his companions  that was why the tin woodman presently stopped and said   something very curious has happened i ought to know by heart and every step of this journey yet i fear we have already lost our way  that is quite impossible protested the scarecrow why do you think my dear friend that we have gone astray  why here before us is a great field of sunflowers—and i never saw this field before in all my life  at these words they all looked around only to find that they were indeed surrounded by a field of tall stalks every stalk bearing at its top a gigantic sunflower and not only were these flowers almost blinding in their vivid hues of red and gold but each one whirled around upon its stalk like a miniature wind-mill completely dazzling the vision of the beholders and so mystifying them that they knew not which way to turn  it’s witchcraft exclaimed tip  while they paused hesitating and wondering the tin woodman uttered a cry of impatience and advanced with swinging axe to cut down the stalks before him but now the sunflowers suddenly stopped their rapid whirling and the travelers plainly saw a girl’s face appear in the center of each flower these lovely faces looked upon the astonished band with mocking smiles and then burst into a chorus of merry laughter at the dismay their appearance caused  stop stop cried tip seizing the woodman’s arm they’re alive they’re girls  at that moment the flowers began whirling again and the faces faded away and were lost in the rapid revolutions  the tin woodman dropped his axe and sat down upon the ground  it would be heartless to chop down those pretty creatures said he despondently and yet i do not know how else we can proceed upon our way  they looked to me strangely like the faces of the army of revolt mused the scarecrow but i cannot conceive how the girls could have followed us here so quickly  i believe it’s magic said tip positively and that someone is playing a trick upon us i’ve known old mombi do things like that before probably it’s nothing more than an illusion and there are no sunflowers here at all  then let us shut our eyes and walk forward suggested the woodman  excuse me replied the scarecrow my eyes are not painted to shut because you happen to have tin eyelids you must not imagine we are all built in the same way  and the eyes of the saw-horse are knot eyes said jack leaning forward to examine them  nevertheless you must ride quickly forward commanded tip and we will follow after you and so try to escape my eyes are already so dazzled that i can scarcely see  so the pumpkinhead rode boldly forward and tip grasped the stub tail of the saw-horse and followed with closed eyes the scarecrow and the tin woodman brought up the rear and before they had gone many yards a joyful shout from jack announced that the way was clear before them  then all paused to look backward but not a trace of the field of sunflowers remained  more cheerfully now they proceeded upon their journey but old mombi had so changed the appearance of the landscape that they would surely have been lost had not the scarecrow wisely concluded to take their direction from the sun for no witch-craft could change the course of the sun and it was therefore a safe guide  however other difficulties lay before them the saw-horse stepped into a rabbit hole and fell to the ground the pumpkinhead was pitched high into the air and his history would probably have ended at that exact moment had not the tin woodman skillfully caught the pumpkin as it descended and saved it from injury  [illustration  image156]  tip soon had it fitted to the neck again and replaced jack upon his feet but the saw-horse did not escape so easily for when his leg was pulled from the rabbit hole it was found to be broken short off and must be replaced or repaired before he could go a step farther  this is quite serious said the tin woodman if there were trees near by i might soon manufacture another leg for this animal but i cannot see even a shrub for miles around  and there are neither fences nor houses in this part of the land of oz added the scarecrow disconsolately  then what shall we do enquired the boy  i suppose i must start my brains working replied his majesty the scarecrow for experience has taught me that i can do anything if i but take time to think it out  let us all think said tip and perhaps we shall find a way to repair the saw-horse  [illustration  image158]  so they sat in a row upon the grass and began to think while the saw-horse occupied itself by gazing curiously upon its broken limb  does it hurt asked the tin woodman in a soft sympathetic voice  not in the least returned the saw-horse but my pride is injured to find that my anatomy is so brittle  for a time the little group remained in silent thought presently the tin woodman raised his head and looked over the fields  what sort of creature is that which approaches us he asked wonderingly  the others followed his gaze and discovered coming toward them the most extraordinary object they had ever beheld it advanced quickly and noiselessly over the soft grass and in a few minutes stood before the adventurers and regarded them with an astonishment equal to their own  [illustration  image159]  the scarecrow was calm under all circumstances  good morning he said politely  the stranger removed his hat with a flourish bowed very low and then responded   good morning one and all i hope you are as an aggregation enjoying excellent health permit me to present my card  with this courteous speech it extended a card toward the scarecrow who accepted it turned it over and over and handed it with a shake of his head to tip  the boy read aloud   mr h m woggle-bug t e  dear me ejaculated the pumpkinhead staring somewhat intently  how very peculiar said the tin woodman  tip’s eyes were round and wondering and the saw-horse uttered a sigh and turned away its head  are you really a woggle-bug enquired the scarecrow  most certainly my dear sir answered the stranger briskly is not my name upon the card  it is said the scarecrow but may i ask what ‘h m’ stands for  ‘h m’ means highly magnified returned the woggle-bug proudly  oh i see the scarecrow viewed the stranger critically and are you in truth highly magnified  sir said the woggle-bug i take you for a gentleman of judgment and discernment does it not occur to you that i am several thousand times greater than any woggle-bug you ever saw before therefore it is plainly evident that i am highly magnified and there is no good reason why you should doubt the fact  pardon me returned the scarecrow my brains are slightly mixed since i was last laundered would it be improper for me to ask also what the ‘te’ at the end of your name stands for  those letters express my degree answered the woggle-bug with a condescending smile to be more explicit the initials mean that i am thoroughly educated  oh said the scarecrow much relieved  tip had not yet taken his eyes off this wonderful personage what he saw was a great round buglike body supported upon two slender legs which ended in delicate feet—the toes curling upward the body of the woggle-bug was rather flat and judging from what could be seen of it was of a glistening dark brown color upon the back while the front was striped with alternate bands of light brown and white blending together at the edges its arms were fully as slender as its legs and upon a rather long neck was perched its head—not unlike the head of a man except that its nose ended in a curling antenna or feeler and its ears from the upper points bore antennae that decorated the sides of its head like two miniature curling pig tails it must be admitted that the round black eyes were rather bulging in appearance but the expression upon the woggle-bug’s face was by no means unpleasant  for dress the insect wore a dark-blue swallowtail coat with a yellow silk lining and a flower in the button-hole a vest of white duck that stretched tightly across the wide body knickerbockers of fawn-colored plush fastened at the knees with gilt buckles and perched upon its small head was jauntily set a tall silk hat  standing upright before our amazed friends the woggle-bug appeared to be fully as tall as the tin woodman and surely no bug in all the land of oz had ever before attained so enormous a size  i confess said the scarecrow that your abrupt appearance has caused me surprise and no doubt has startled my companions i hope however that this circumstance will not distress you we shall probably get used to you in time  do not apologize i beg of you returned the woggle-bug earnestly it affords me great pleasure to surprise people for surely i cannot be classed with ordinary insects and am entitled to both curiosity and admiration from those i meet  you are indeed agreed his majesty  if you will permit me to seat myself in your august company continued the stranger i will gladly relate my history so that you will be better able to comprehend my unusual—may i say remarkable—appearance  you may say what you please answered the tin woodman briefly  so the woggle-bug sat down upon the grass facing the little group of wanderers and told them the following story   [illustration  image164]  [illustration  image165]     a highly magnified history   it is but honest that i should acknowledge at the beginning of my recital that i was born an ordinary woggle-bug began the creature in a frank and friendly tone knowing no better i used my arms as well as my legs for walking and crawled under the edges of stones or hid among the roots of grasses with no thought beyond finding a few insects smaller than myself to feed upon  the chill nights rendered me stiff and motionless for i wore no clothing but each morning the warm rays of the sun gave me new life and restored me to activity a horrible existence is this but you must remember it is the regular ordained existence of woggle-bugs as well as of many other tiny creatures that inhabit the earth  but destiny had singled me out humble though i was for a grander fate one day i crawled near to a country school house and my curiosity being excited by the monotonous hum of the students within i made bold to enter and creep along a crack between two boards until i reached the far end where in front of a hearth of glowing embers sat the master at his desk  no one noticed so small a creature as a woggle-bug and when i found that the hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine i resolved to establish my future home beside it so i found a charming nest between two bricks and hid myself therein for many many months  professor nowitall is doubtless the most famous scholar in the land of oz and after a few days i began to listen to the lectures and discourses he gave his pupils not one of them was more attentive than the humble unnoticed woggle-bug and i acquired in this way a fund of knowledge that i will myself confess is simply marvelous that is why i place ‘te’ thoroughly educated upon my cards for my greatest pride lies in the fact that the world cannot produce another woggle-bug with a tenth part of my own culture and erudition  i do not blame you said the scarecrow education is a thing to be proud of i’m educated myself the mess of brains given me by the great wizard is considered by my friends to be unexcelled  nevertheless interrupted the tin woodman a good heart is i believe much more desirable than education or brains  to me said the saw-horse a good leg is more desirable than either  could seeds be considered in the light of brains enquired the pumpkinhead abruptly  keep quiet commanded tip sternly  very well dear father answered the obedient jack  the woggle-bug listened patiently—even respectfully—to these remarks and then resumed his story  i must have lived fully three years in that secluded school-house hearth said he drinking thirstily of the ever-flowing fount of limpid knowledge before me  quite poetical commented the scarecrow nodding his head approvingly  but one day continued the bug a marvelous circumstance occurred that altered my very existence and brought me to my present pinnacle of greatness the professor discovered me in the act of crawling across the hearth and before i could escape he had caught me between his thumb and forefinger  [illustration  image167]  ‘my dear children’ said he ‘i have captured a woggle-bug—a very rare and interesting specimen do any of you know what a woggle-bug is’  ‘no’ yelled the scholars in chorus  ‘then’ said the professor ‘i will get out my famous magnifying-glass and throw the insect upon a screen in a highly-magnified condition that you may all study carefully its peculiar construction and become acquainted with its habits and manner of life’  he then brought from a cupboard a most curious instrument and before i could realize what had happened i found myself thrown upon a screen in a highly-magnified state—even as you now behold me  [illustration  image169]  the students stood up on their stools and craned their heads forward to get a better view of me and two little girls jumped upon the sill of an open window where they could see more plainly  ‘behold’ cried the professor in a loud voice ‘this highly-magnified woggle-bug one of the most curious insects in existence’  being thoroughly educated and knowing what is required of a cultured gentleman at this juncture i stood upright and placing my hand upon my bosom made a very polite bow my action being unexpected must have startled them for one of the little girls perched upon the window-sill gave a scream and fell backward out the window drawing her companion with her as she disappeared  the professor uttered a cry of horror and rushed away through the door to see if the poor children were injured by the fall the scholars followed after him in a wild mob and i was left alone in the school-room still in a highly-magnified state and free to do as i pleased  it immediately occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to escape i was proud of my great size and realized that now i could safely travel anywhere in the world while my superior culture would make me a fit associate for the most learned person i might chance to meet  so while the professor picked the little girls—who were more frightened than hurt—off the ground and the pupils clustered around him closely grouped i calmly walked out of the school-house turned a corner and escaped unnoticed to a grove of trees that stood near  wonderful exclaimed the pumpkinhead admiringly  it was indeed agreed the woggle-bug i have never ceased to congratulate myself for escaping while i was highly magnified for even my excessive knowledge would have proved of little use to me had i remained a tiny insignificant insect  [illustration  image171]  i didn’t know before said tip looking at the woggle-bug with a puzzled expression that insects wore clothes  nor do they in their natural state returned the stranger but in the course of my wanderings i had the good fortune to save the ninth life of a tailor—tailors having like cats nine lives as you probably know the fellow was exceedingly grateful for had he lost that ninth life it would have been the end of him so he begged permission to furnish me with the stylish costume i now wear it fits very nicely does it not and the woggle-bug stood up and turned himself around slowly that all might examine his person  he must have been a good tailor said the scarecrow somewhat enviously  he was a good-hearted tailor at any rate observed nick chopper  but where were you going when you met us tip asked the woggle-bug  nowhere in particular was the reply although it is my intention soon to visit the emerald city and arrange to give a course of lectures to select audiences on the ‘advantages of magnification’  we are bound for the emerald city now said the tin woodman so if it pleases you to do so you are welcome to travel in our company  the woggle-bug bowed with profound grace  it will give me great pleasure said he to accept your kind invitation for nowhere in the land of oz could i hope to meet with so congenial a company  that is true acknowledged the pumpkinhead we are quite as congenial as flies and honey  but—pardon me if i seem inquisitive—are you not all rather—ahem rather unusual asked the woggle-bug looking from one to another with unconcealed interest  not more so than yourself answered the scarecrow everything in life is unusual until you get accustomed to it  what rare philosophy exclaimed the woggle-bug admiringly  yes my brains are working well today admitted the scarecrow an accent of pride in his voice  then if you are sufficiently rested and refreshed let us bend our steps toward the emerald city suggested the magnified one  we can’t said tip the saw-horse has broken a leg so he can’t bend his steps and there is no wood around to make him a new limb from and we can’t leave the horse behind because the pumpkinhead is so stiff in his joints that he has to ride  how very unfortunate cried the woggle-bug then he looked the party over carefully and said   if the pumpkinhead is to ride why not use one of his legs to make a leg for the horse that carries him i judge that both are made of wood  now that is what i call real cleverness said the scarecrow approvingly i wonder my brains did not think of that long ago get to work my dear nick and fit the pumpkinhead’s leg to the saw-horse  jack was not especially pleased with this idea but he submitted to having his left leg amputated by the tin woodman and whittled down to fit the left leg of the saw-horse nor was the saw-horse especially pleased with the operation either for he growled a good deal about being butchered as he called it and afterward declared that the new leg was a disgrace to a respectable saw-horse  i beg you to be more careful in your speech said the pumpkinhead sharply remember if you please that it is my leg you are abusing  i cannot forget it retorted the saw-horse for it is quite as flimsy as the rest of your person  flimsy me flimsy cried jack in a rage how dare you call me flimsy  because you are built as absurdly as a jumping-jack sneered the horse rolling his knotty eyes in a vicious manner even your head won’t stay straight and you never can tell whether you are looking backwards or forwards  friends i entreat you not to quarrel pleaded the tin woodman anxiously as a matter of fact we are none of us above criticism so let us bear with each others’ faults  an excellent suggestion said the woggle-bug approvingly you must have an excellent heart my metallic friend  i have returned nick well pleased my heart is quite the best part of me but now let us start upon our journey  they perched the one-legged pumpkinhead upon the saw-horse and tied him to his seat with cords so that he could not possibly fall off  and then following the lead of the scarecrow they all advanced in the direction of the emerald city  [illustration  image175]  [illustration  image176]  [illustration  image177]     old mombi indulges in witchcraft   they soon discovered that the saw-horse limped for his new leg was a trifle too long so they were obliged to halt while the tin woodman chopped it down with his axe after which the wooden steed paced along more comfortably but the saw-horse was not entirely satisfied even yet  it was a shame that i broke my other leg it growled  on the contrary airily remarked the woggle-bug who was walking alongside you should consider the accident most fortunate for a horse is never of much use until he has been broken  i beg your pardon said tip rather provoked for he felt a warm interest in both the saw-horse and his man jack but permit me to say that your joke is a poor one and as old as it is poor  still it is a joke declared the woggle-bug firmly and a joke derived from a play upon words is considered among educated people to be eminently proper  what does that mean enquired the pumpkinhead stupidly  it means my dear friend explained the woggle-bug that our language contains many words having a double meaning and that to pronounce a joke that allows both meanings of a certain word proves the joker a person of culture and refinement who has moreover a thorough command of the language  i don’t believe that said tip plainly anybody can make a pun  not so rejoined the woggle-bug stiffly it requires education of a high order are you educated young sir  not especially admitted tip  then you cannot judge the matter i myself am thoroughly educated and i say that puns display genius for instance were i to ride upon this saw-horse he would not only be an animal he would become an equipage for he would then be a horse-and-buggy  at this the scarecrow gave a gasp and the tin woodman stopped short and looked reproachfully at the woggle-bug at the same time the saw-horse loudly snorted his derision and even the pumpkinhead put up his hand to hide the smile which because it was carved upon his face he could not change to a frown  but the woggle-bug strutted along as if he had made some brilliant remark and the scarecrow was obliged to say   i have heard my dear friend that a person can become over-educated and although i have a high respect for brains no matter how they may be arranged or classified i begin to suspect that yours are slightly tangled in any event i must beg you to restrain your superior education while in our society  we are not very particular added the tin woodman and we are exceedingly kind hearted but if your superior culture gets leaky again— he did not complete the sentence but he twirled his gleaming axe so carelessly that the woggle-bug looked frightened and shrank away to a safe distance  the others marched on in silence and the highly magnified one after a period of deep thought said in an humble voice   i will endeavor to restrain myself  that is all we can expect returned the scarecrow pleasantly and good nature being thus happily restored to the party they proceeded upon their way  when they again stopped to allow tip to rest—the boy being the only one that seemed to tire—the tin woodman noticed many small round holes in the grassy meadow  this must be a village of the field mice he said to the scarecrow i wonder if my old friend the queen of the mice is in this neighborhood  if she is she may be of great service to us answered the scarecrow who was impressed by a sudden thought see if you can call her my dear nick  so the tin woodman blew a shrill note upon a silver whistle that hung around his neck and presently a tiny grey mouse popped from a near-by hole and advanced fearlessly toward them for the tin woodman had once saved her life and the queen of the field mice knew he was to be trusted  good day your majesty said nick politely addressing the mouse i trust you are enjoying good health  thank you i am quite well answered the queen demurely as she sat up and displayed the tiny golden crown upon her head can i do anything to assist my old friends  you can indeed replied the scarecrow eagerly let me i intreat you take a dozen of your subjects with me to the emerald city  will they be injured in any way asked the queen doubtfully  i think not replied the scarecrow i will carry them hidden in the straw which stuffs my body and when i give them the signal by unbuttoning my jacket they have only to rush out and scamper home again as fast as they can by doing this they will assist me to regain my throne which the army of revolt has taken from me  in that case said the queen i will not refuse your request whenever you are ready i will call twelve of my most intelligent subjects  i am ready now returned the scarecrow then he lay flat upon the ground and unbuttoned his jacket displaying the mass of straw with which he was stuffed  the queen uttered a little piping call and in an instant a dozen pretty field mice had emerged from their holes and stood before their ruler awaiting her orders  [illustration  image181]  what the queen said to them none of our travelers could understand for it was in the mouse language but the field mice obeyed without hesitation running one after the other to the scarecrow and hiding themselves in the straw of his breast  when all of the twelve mice had thus concealed themselves the scarecrow buttoned his jacket securely and then arose and thanked the queen for her kindness  one thing more you might do to serve us suggested the tin woodman and that is to run ahead and show us the way to the emerald city for some enemy is evidently trying to prevent us from reaching it  i will do that gladly returned the queen are you ready  the tin woodman looked at tip  i’m rested said the boy let us start  then they resumed their journey the little grey queen of the field mice running swiftly ahead and then pausing until the travelers drew near when away she would dart again  without this unerring guide the scarecrow and his comrades might never have gained the emerald city for many were the obstacles thrown in their way by the arts of old mombi yet not one of the obstacles really existed—all were cleverly contrived deceptions for when they came to the banks of a rushing river that threatened to bar their way the little queen kept steadily on passing through the seeming flood in safety and our travelers followed her without encountering a single drop of water  again a high wall of granite towered high above their heads and opposed their advance but the grey field mouse walked straight through it and the others did the same the wall melting into mist as they passed it  afterward when they had stopped for a moment to allow tip to rest they saw forty roads branching off from their feet in forty different directions and soon these forty roads began whirling around like a mighty wheel first in one direction and then in the other completely bewildering their vision  but the queen called for them to follow her and darted off in a straight line and when they had gone a few paces the whirling pathways vanished and were seen no more  mombi’s last trick was the most fearful of all she sent a sheet of crackling flame rushing over the meadow to consume them and for the first time the scarecrow became afraid and turned to fly  if that fire reaches me i will be gone in no time said he trembling until his straw rattled it’s the most dangerous thing i ever encountered  i’m off too cried the saw-horse turning and prancing with agitation for my wood is so dry it would burn like kindlings  is fire dangerous to pumpkins asked jack fearfully  you’ll be baked like a tart—and so will i answered the woggle-bug getting down on all fours so he could run the faster  but the tin woodman having no fear of fire averted the stampede by a few sensible words  look at the field mouse he shouted the fire does not burn her in the least in fact it is no fire at all but only a deception  indeed to watch the little queen march calmly through the advancing flames restored courage to every member of the party and they followed her without being even scorched  this is surely a most extraordinary adventure said the woggle-bug who was greatly amazed for it upsets all the natural laws that i heard professor nowitall teach in the school-house  of course it does said the scarecrow wisely all magic is unnatural and for that reason is to be feared and avoided but i see before us the gates of the emerald city so i imagine we have now overcome all the magical obstacles that seemed to oppose us  indeed the walls of the city were plainly visible and the queen of the field mice who had guided them so faithfully came near to bid them good-bye  we are very grateful to your majesty for your kind assistance said the tin woodman bowing before the pretty creature  i am always pleased to be of service to my friends answered the queen and in a flash she had darted away upon her journey home  [illustration  image188]  [illustration  image189]     the prisoners of the queen   approaching the gateway of the emerald city the travelers found it guarded by two girls of the army of revolt who opposed their entrance by drawing the knitting-needles from their hair and threatening to prod the first that came near  but the tin woodman was not afraid  at the worst they can but scratch my beautiful nickel-plate he said but there will be no ‘worst’ for i think i can manage to frighten these absurd soldiers very easily follow me closely all of you  then swinging his axe in a great circle to right and left before him he advanced upon the gate and the others followed him without hesitation  the girls who had expected no resistance whatever were terrified by the sweep of the glittering axe and fled screaming into the city so that our travelers passed the gates in safety and marched down the green marble pavement of the wide street toward the royal palace  at this rate we will soon have your majesty upon the throne again said the tin woodman laughing at his easy conquest of the guards  thank you friend nick returned the scarecrow gratefully nothing can resist your kind heart and your sharp axe  as they passed the rows of houses they saw through the open doors that men were sweeping and dusting and washing dishes while the women sat around in groups gossiping and laughing  what has happened the scarecrow asked a sad-looking man with a bushy beard who wore an apron and was wheeling a baby-carriage along the sidewalk  why we’ve had a revolution your majesty as you ought to know very well replied the man and since you went away the women have been running things to suit themselves i’m glad you have decided to come back and restore order for doing housework and minding the children is wearing out the strength of every man in the emerald city  hm said the scarecrow thoughtfully if it is such hard work as you say how did the women manage it so easily  i really do not know replied the man with a deep sigh perhaps the women are made of castiron  no movement was made as they passed along the street to oppose their progress several of the women stopped their gossip long enough to cast curious looks upon our friends but immediately they would turn away with a laugh or a sneer and resume their chatter and when they met with several girls belonging to the army of revolt those soldiers instead of being alarmed or appearing surprised merely stepped out of the way and allowed them to advance without protest  this action rendered the scarecrow uneasy  i’m afraid we are walking into a trap said he  nonsense returned nick chopper confidently the silly creatures are conquered already  but the scarecrow shook his head in a way that expressed doubt and tip said   [illustration  image192]  it’s too easy altogether look out for trouble ahead  i will returned his majesty unopposed they reached the royal palace and marched up the marble steps which had once been thickly crusted with emeralds but were now filled with tiny holes where the jewels had been ruthlessly torn from their settings by the army of revolt and so far not a rebel barred their way  through the arched hallways and into the magnificent throne room marched the tin woodman and his followers and here when the green silken curtains fell behind them they saw a curious sight  seated within the glittering throne was general jinjur with the scarecrow’s second-best crown upon her head and the royal sceptre in her right hand a box of caramels from which she was eating rested in her lap and the girl seemed entirely at ease in her royal surroundings  the scarecrow stepped forward and confronted her while the tin woodman leaned upon his axe and the others formed a half-circle back of his majesty’s person  how dare you sit in my throne demanded the scarecrow sternly eyeing the intruder don’t you know you are guilty of treason and that there is a law against treason  the throne belongs to whoever is able to take it answered jinjur as she slowly ate another caramel i have taken it as you see so just now i am the queen and all who oppose me are guilty of treason and must be punished by the law you have just mentioned  this view of the case puzzled the scarecrow  how is it friend nick he asked turning to the tin woodman  why when it comes to law i have nothing to say answered that personage for laws were never meant to be understood and it is foolish to make the attempt  then what shall we do asked the scarecrow in dismay  why don’t you marry the queen and then you can both rule suggested the woggle-bug  jinjur glared at the insect fiercely why don’t you send her back to her mother where she belongs asked jack pumpkinhead  jinjur frowned  why don’t you shut her up in a closet until she behaves herself and promises to be good enquired tip jinjur’s lip curled scornfully  or give her a good shaking added the saw-horse  no said the tin woodman we must treat the poor girl with gentleness let us give her all the jewels she can carry and send her away happy and contented  [illustration  image195]  at this queen jinjur laughed aloud and the next minute clapped her pretty hands together thrice as if for a signal  you are very absurd creatures said she but i am tired of your nonsense and have no time to bother with you longer  while the monarch and his friends listened in amazement to this impudent speech a startling thing happened the tin woodman’s axe was snatched from his grasp by some person behind him and he found himself disarmed and helpless at the same instant a shout of laughter rang in the ears of the devoted band and turning to see whence this came they found themselves surrounded by the army of revolt the girls bearing in either hand their glistening knitting-needles the entire throne room seemed to be filled with the rebels and the scarecrow and his comrades realized that they were prisoners  you see how foolish it is to oppose a woman’s wit said jinjur gaily and this event only proves that i am more fit to rule the emerald city than a scarecrow i bear you no ill will i assure you but lest you should prove troublesome to me in the future i shall order you all to be destroyed that is all except the boy who belongs to old mombi and must be restored to her keeping the rest of you are not human and therefore it will not be wicked to demolish you the saw-horse and the pumpkinhead’s body i will have chopped up for kindling-wood and the pumpkin shall be made into tarts the scarecrow will do nicely to start a bonfire and the tin man can be cut into small pieces and fed to the goats as for this immense woggle-bug—  highly magnified if you please interrupted the insect  i think i will ask the cook to make green-turtle soup of you continued the queen reflectively  the woggle-bug shuddered  or if that won’t do we might use you for a hungarian goulash stewed and highly spiced she added cruelly  this programme of extermination was so terrible that the prisoners looked upon one another in a panic of fear the scarecrow alone did not give way to despair he stood quietly before the queen and his brow was wrinkled in deep thought as he strove to find some means to escape  while thus engaged he felt the straw within his breast move gently at once his expression changed from sadness to joy and raising his hand he quickly unbuttoned the front of his jacket  this action did not pass unnoticed by the crowd of girls clustering about him but none of them suspected what he was doing until a tiny grey mouse leaped from his bosom to the floor and scampered away between the feet of the army of revolt another mouse quickly followed then another and another in rapid succession and suddenly such a scream of terror went up from the army that it might easily have filled the stoutest heart with consternation the flight that ensued turned to a stampede and the stampede to a panic  for while the startled mice rushed wildly about the room the scarecrow had only time to note a whirl of skirts and a twinkling of feet as the girls disappeared from the palace—pushing and crowding one another in their mad efforts to escape  the queen at the first alarm stood up on the cushions of the throne and began to dance frantically upon her tiptoes then a mouse ran up the cushions and with a terrified leap poor jinjur shot clear over the head of the scarecrow and escaped through an archway—never pausing in her wild career until she had reached the city gates  so in less time than i can explain the throne room was deserted by all save the scarecrow and his friends and the woggle-bug heaved a deep sigh of relief as he exclaimed   thank goodness we are saved  for a time yes answered the tin woodman but the enemy will soon return i fear  let us bar all the entrances to the palace said the scarecrow then we shall have time to think what is best to be done  so all except jack pumpkinhead who was still tied fast to the saw-horse ran to the various entrances of the royal palace and closed the heavy doors bolting and locking them securely then knowing that the army of revolt could not batter down the barriers in several days the adventurers gathered once more in the throne room for a council of war  [illustration  image201]  [illustration  image202]  [illustration  image203]     the scarecrow takes time to think   it seems to me began the scarecrow when all were again assembled in the throne room that the girl jinjur is quite right in claiming to be queen and if she is right then i am wrong and we have no business to be occupying her palace  but you were the king until she came said the woggle-bug strutting up and down with his hands in his pockets so it appears to me that she is the interloper instead of you  especially as we have just conquered her and put her to flight added the pumpkinhead as he raised his hands to turn his face toward the scarecrow  have we really conquered her asked the scarecrow quietly look out of the window and tell me what you see  tip ran to the window and looked out  the palace is surrounded by a double row of girl soldiers he announced  i thought so returned the scarecrow we are as truly their prisoners as we were before the mice frightened them from the palace  my friend is right said nick chopper who had been polishing his breast with a bit of chamois-leather jinjur is still the queen and we are her prisoners  but i hope she cannot get at us exclaimed the pumpkinhead with a shiver of fear she threatened to make tarts of me you know  don’t worry said the tin woodman it cannot matter greatly if you stay shut up here you will spoil in time anyway a good tart is far more admirable than a decayed intellect  very true agreed the scarecrow  oh dear moaned jack what an unhappy lot is mine why dear father did you not make me out of tin—or even out of straw—so that i would keep indefinitely  shucks returned tip indignantly you ought to be glad that i made you at all then he added reflectively everything has to come to an end some time  but i beg to remind you broke in the woggle-bug who had a distressed look in his bulging round eyes that this terrible queen jinjur suggested making a goulash of me—me the only highly magnified and thoroughly educated woggle-bug in the wide wide world  i think it was a brilliant idea remarked the scarecrow approvingly  don’t you imagine he would make a better soup asked the tin woodman turning toward his friend  well perhaps acknowledged the scarecrow  the woggle-bug groaned  i can see in my mind’s eye said he mournfully the goats eating small pieces of my dear comrade the tin woodman while my soup is being cooked on a bonfire built of the saw-horse and jack pumpkinhead’s body and queen jinjur watches me boil while she feeds the flames with my friend the scarecrow  [illustration  image205]  this morbid picture cast a gloom over the entire party making them restless and anxious  it can’t happen for some time said the tin woodman trying to speak cheerfully for we shall be able to keep jinjur out of the palace until she manages to break down the doors  and in the meantime i am liable to starve to death and so is the woggle-bug announced tip  as for me said the woggle-bug i think that i could live for some time on jack pumpkinhead not that i prefer pumpkins for food but i believe they are somewhat nutritious and jack’s head is large and plump  how heartless exclaimed the tin woodman greatly shocked are we cannibals let me ask or are we faithful friends  i see very clearly that we cannot stay shut up in this palace said the scarecrow with decision so let us end this mournful talk and try to discover a means to escape  at this suggestion they all gathered eagerly around the throne wherein was seated the scarecrow and as tip sat down upon a stool there fell from his pocket a pepper-box which rolled upon the floor  what is this asked nick chopper picking up the box  be careful cried the boy that’s my powder of life don’t spill it for it is nearly gone  and what is the powder of life enquired the scarecrow as tip replaced the box carefully in his pocket  it’s some magical stuff old mombi got from a crooked sorcerer explained the boy she brought jack to life with it and afterward i used it to bring the saw-horse to life i guess it will make anything live that is sprinkled with it but there’s only about one dose left  then it is very precious said the tin woodman  indeed it is agreed the scarecrow it may prove our best means of escape from our difficulties i believe i will think for a few minutes so i will thank you friend tip to get out your knife and rip this heavy crown from my forehead  tip soon cut the stitches that had fastened the crown to the scarecrow’s head and the former monarch of the emerald city removed it with a sigh of relief and hung it on a peg beside the throne  [illustration  image209]  that is my last memento of royalty said he and i’m glad to get rid of it the former king of this city who was named pastoria lost the crown to the wonderful wizard who passed it on to me now the girl jinjur claims it and i sincerely hope it will not give her a headache  a kindly thought which i greatly admire said the tin woodman nodding approvingly  and now i will indulge in a quiet think continued the scarecrow lying back in the throne  the others remained as silent and still as possible so as not to disturb him for all had great confidence in the extraordinary brains of the scarecrow  and after what seemed a very long time indeed to the anxious watchers the thinker sat up looked upon his friends with his most whimsical expression and said   my brains work beautifully today i’m quite proud of them now listen if we attempt to escape through the doors of the palace we shall surely be captured and as we can’t escape through the ground there is only one other thing to be done we must escape through the air  he paused to note the effect of these words but all his hearers seemed puzzled and unconvinced  the wonderful wizard escaped in a balloon he continued we don’t know how to make a balloon of course but any sort of thing that can fly through the air can carry us easily so i suggest that my friend the tin woodman who is a skillful mechanic shall build some sort of a machine with good strong wings to carry us and our friend tip can then bring the thing to life with his magical powder  bravo cried nick chopper  what splendid brains murmured jack  really quite clever said the educated woggle-bug  i believe it can be done declared tip that is if the tin woodman is equal to making the thing  i’ll do my best said nick cheerily and as a matter of fact i do not often fail in what i attempt but the thing will have to be built on the roof of the palace so it can rise comfortably into the air  [illustration  image211]  to be sure said the scarecrow  then let us search through the palace continued the tin woodman and carry all the material we can find to the roof where i will begin my work  first however said the pumpkinhead i beg you will release me from this horse and make me another leg to walk with for in my present condition i am of no use to myself or to anyone else  so the tin woodman knocked a mahogany center-table to pieces with his axe and fitted one of the legs which was beautifully carved on to the body of jack pumpkinhead who was very proud of the acquisition  it seems strange said he as he watched the tin woodman work that my left leg should be the most elegant and substantial part of me  that proves you are unusual returned the scarecrow and i am convinced that the only people worthy of consideration in this world are the unusual ones for the common folks are like the leaves of a tree and live and die unnoticed  spoken like a philosopher cried the woggle-bug as he assisted the tin woodman to set jack upon his feet  how do you feel now asked tip watching the pumpkinhead stump around to try his new leg  as good as new answered jack joyfully and quite ready to assist you all to escape  then let us get to work said the scarecrow in a business-like tone  so glad to be doing anything that might lead to the end of their captivity the friends separated to wander over the palace in search of fitting material to use in the construction of their aerial machine  [illustration  image213]  [illustration  image214]  [illustration  image215]     the astonishing flight of the gump   when the adventurers reassembled upon the roof it was found that a remarkably queer assortment of articles had been selected by the various members of the party no one seemed to have a very clear idea of what was required but all had brought something  the woggle-bug had taken from its position over the mantle-piece in the great hallway the head of a gump which was adorned with wide-spreading antlers and this with great care and greater difficulty the insect had carried up the stairs to the roof this gump resembled an elk’s head only the nose turned upward in a saucy manner and there were whiskers upon its chin like those of a billy-goat why the woggle-bug selected this article he could not have explained except that it had aroused his curiosity  tip with the aid of the saw-horse had brought a large upholstered sofa to the roof it was an oldfashioned piece of furniture with high back and ends and it was so heavy that even by resting the greatest weight upon the back of the saw-horse the boy found himself out of breath when at last the clumsy sofa was dumped upon the roof  [illustration  image217]  the pumpkinhead had brought a broom which was the first thing he saw the scarecrow arrived with a coil of clothes-lines and ropes which he had taken from the courtyard and in his trip up the stairs he had become so entangled in the loose ends of the ropes that both he and his burden tumbled in a heap upon the roof and might have rolled off if tip had not rescued him  the tin woodman appeared last he also had been to the courtyard where he had cut four great spreading leaves from a huge palm-tree that was the pride of all the inhabitants of the emerald city  my dear nick exclaimed the scarecrow seeing what his friend had done you have been guilty of the greatest crime any person can commit in the emerald city if i remember rightly the penalty for chopping leaves from the royal palm-tree is to be killed seven times and afterward imprisoned for life  it cannot be helped now answered the tin woodman throwing down the big leaves upon the roof but it may be one more reason why it is necessary for us to escape and now let us see what you have found for me to work with  many were the doubtful looks cast upon the heap of miscellaneous material that now cluttered the roof and finally the scarecrow shook his head and remarked   well if friend nick can manufacture from this mess of rubbish a thing that will fly through the air and carry us to safety then i will acknowledge him to be a better mechanic than i suspected  but the tin woodman seemed at first by no means sure of his powers and only after polishing his forehead vigorously with the chamois-leather did he resolve to undertake the task  the first thing required for the machine said he is a body big enough to carry the entire party this sofa is the biggest thing we have and might be used for a body but should the machine ever tip sideways we would all slide off and fall to the ground  why not use two sofas asked tip there’s another one just like this down stairs  that is a very sensible suggestion exclaimed the tin woodman you must fetch the other sofa at once  so tip and the saw-horse managed with much labor to get the second sofa to the roof and when the two were placed together edge to edge the backs and ends formed a protecting rampart all around the seats  excellent cried the scarecrow we can ride within this snug nest quite at our ease  the two sofas were now bound firmly together with ropes and clothes-lines and then nick chopper fastened the gump’s head to one end  that will show which is the front end of the thing said he greatly pleased with the idea and really if you examine it critically the gump looks very well as a figure-head these great palm-leaves for which i have endangered my life seven times must serve us as wings  are they strong enough asked the boy  they are as strong as anything we can get answered the woodman and although they are not in proportion to the thing’s body we are not in a position to be very particular  so he fastened the palm-leaves to the sofas two on each side  said the woggle-bug with considerable admiration   the thing is now complete and only needs to be brought to life  stop a moment exclaimed jack are you not going to use my broom  what for asked the scarecrow  why it can be fastened to the back end for a tail answered the pumpkinhead surely you would not call the thing complete without a tail  hm said the tin woodman i do not see the use of a tail we are not trying to copy a beast or a fish or a bird all we ask of the thing is to carry us through the air  perhaps after the thing is brought to life it can use a tail to steer with suggested the scarecrow for if it flies through the air it will not be unlike a bird and i’ve noticed that all birds have tails which they use for a rudder while flying  very well answered nick the broom shall be used for a tail and he fastened it firmly to the back end of the sofa body  tip took the pepper-box from his pocket  the thing looks very big said he anxiously and i am not sure there is enough powder left to bring all of it to life but i’ll make it go as far as possible  put most on the wings said nick chopper for they must be made as strong as possible  and don’t forget the head exclaimed the woggle-bug  or the tail added jack pumpkinhead  do be quiet said tip nervously you must give me a chance to work the magic charm in the proper manner  very carefully he began sprinkling the thing with the precious powder each of the four wings was first lightly covered with a layer then the sofas were sprinkled and the broom given a slight coating  the head the head don’t i beg of you forget the head cried the woggle-bug excitedly  there’s only a little of the powder left announced tip looking within the box and it seems to me it is more important to bring the legs of the sofas to life than the head  not so decided the scarecrow every thing must have a head to direct it and since this creature is to fly and not walk it is really unimportant whether its legs are alive or not  so tip abided by this decision and sprinkled the gump’s head with the remainder of the powder  now said he keep silence while i work the charm  having heard old mombi pronounce the magic words and having also succeeded in bringing the saw-horse to life tip did not hesitate an instant in speaking the three cabalistic words each accompanied by the peculiar gesture of the hands  it was a grave and impressive ceremony  as he finished the incantation the thing shuddered throughout its huge bulk the gump gave the screeching cry that is familiar to those animals and then the four wings began flopping furiously  [illustration  image222]  tip managed to grasp a chimney else he would have been blown off the roof by the terrible breeze raised by the wings the scarecrow being light in weight was caught up bodily and borne through the air until tip luckily seized him by one leg and held him fast the woggle-bug lay flat upon the roof and so escaped harm and the tin woodman whose weight of tin anchored him firmly threw both arms around jack pumpkinhead and managed to save him the saw-horse toppled over upon his back and lay with his legs waving helplessly above him  and now while all were struggling to recover themselves the thing rose slowly from the roof and mounted into the air  here come back cried tip in a frightened voice as he clung to the chimney with one hand and the scarecrow with the other come back at once i command you  it was now that the wisdom of the scarecrow in bringing the head of the thing to life instead of the legs was proved beyond a doubt for the gump already high in the air turned its head at tip’s command and gradually circled around until it could view the roof of the palace  come back shouted the boy again  and the gump obeyed slowly and gracefully waving its four wings in the air until the thing had settled once more upon the roof and become still  [illustration  image224]  [illustration  image225]     in the jackdaw’s nest   this said the gump in a squeaky voice not at all proportioned to the size of its great body is the most novel experience i ever heard of the last thing i remember distinctly is walking through the forest and hearing a loud noise something probably killed me then and it certainly ought to have been the end of me yet here i am alive again with four monstrous wings and a body which i venture to say would make any respectable animal or fowl weep with shame to own what does it all mean am i a gump or am i a juggernaut the creature as it spoke wiggled its chin whiskers in a very comical manner  you’re just a thing answered tip with a gump’s head on it and we have made you and brought you to life so that you may carry us through the air wherever we wish to go  very good said the thing as i am not a gump i cannot have a gump’s pride or independent spirit so i may as well become your servant as anything else my only satisfaction is that i do not seem to have a very strong constitution and am not likely to live long in a state of slavery  don’t say that i beg of you cried the tin woodman whose excellent heart was strongly affected by this sad speech are you not feeling well today  oh as for that returned the gump it is my first day of existence so i cannot judge whether i am feeling well or ill and it waved its broom tail to and fro in a pensive manner  come come said the scarecrow kindly do try to be more cheerful and take life as you find it we shall be kind masters and will strive to render your existence as pleasant as possible are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go  certainly answered the gump i greatly prefer to navigate the air for should i travel on the earth and meet with one of my own species my embarrassment would be something awful  i can appreciate that said the tin woodman sympathetically  and yet continued the thing when i carefully look you over my masters none of you seems to be constructed much more artistically than i am  appearances are deceitful said the woggle-bug earnestly i am both highly magnified and thoroughly educated  indeed murmured the gump indifferently  and my brains are considered remarkably rare specimens added the scarecrow proudly  how strange remarked the gump  although i am of tin said the woodman i own a heart altogether the warmest and most admirable in the whole world  i’m delighted to hear it replied the gump with a slight cough  my smile said jack pumpkinhead is worthy your best attention it is always the same  semper idem explained the woggle-bug pompously and the gump turned to stare at him  and i declared the saw-horse filling in an awkward pause am only remarkable because i can’t help it  i am proud indeed to meet with such exceptional masters said the gump in a careless tone if i could but secure so complete an introduction to myself i would be more than satisfied  that will come in time remarked the scarecrow to ‘know thyself’ is considered quite an accomplishment which it has taken us who are your elders months to perfect but now he added turning to the others let us get aboard and start upon our journey  where shall we go asked tip as he clambered to a seat on the sofas and assisted the pumpkinhead to follow him  in the south country rules a very delightful queen called glinda the good who i am sure will gladly receive us said the scarecrow getting into the thing clumsily let us go to her and ask her advice  that is cleverly thought of declared nick chopper giving the woggle-bug a boost and then toppling the saw-horse into the rear end of the cushioned seats i know glinda the good and believe she will prove a friend indeed  are we all ready asked the boy  yes announced the tin woodman seating himself beside the scarecrow  then said tip addressing the gump be kind enough to fly with us to the southward and do not go higher than to escape the houses and trees for it makes me dizzy to be up so far  all right answered the gump briefly  it flopped its four huge wings and rose slowly into the air and then while our little band of adventurers clung to the backs and sides of the sofas for support the gump turned toward the south and soared swiftly and majestically away  [illustration  image229]  the scenic effect from this altitude is marvelous commented the educated woggle-bug as they rode along  never mind the scenery said the scarecrow hold on tight or you may get a tumble the thing seems to rock badly  it will be dark soon said tip observing that the sun was low on the horizon perhaps we should have waited until morning i wonder if the gump can fly in the night  i’ve been wondering that myself returned the gump quietly you see this is a new experience to me i used to have legs that carried me swiftly over the ground but now my legs feel as if they were asleep  they are said tip we didn’t bring ’em to life  you’re expected to fly explained the scarecrow not to walk  we can walk ourselves said the woggle-bug  i begin to understand what is required of me remarked the gump so i will do my best to please you and he flew on for a time in silence  presently jack pumpkinhead became uneasy  i wonder if riding through the air is liable to spoil pumpkins he said  not unless you carelessly drop your head over the side answered the woggle-bug in that event your head would no longer be a pumpkin for it would become a squash  have i not asked you to restrain these unfeeling jokes demanded tip looking at the woggle-bug with a severe expression  you have and i’ve restrained a good many of them replied the insect but there are opportunities for so many excellent puns in our language that to an educated person like myself the temptation to express them is almost irresistible  people with more or less education discovered those puns centuries ago said tip  are you sure asked the woggle-bug with a startled look  of course i am answered the boy an educated woggle-bug may be a new thing but a woggle-bug education is as old as the hills judging from the display you make of it  the insect seemed much impressed by this remark and for a time maintained a meek silence  the scarecrow in shifting his seat saw upon the cushions the pepper-box which tip had cast aside and began to examine it  throw it overboard said the boy it’s quite empty now and there’s no use keeping it  is it really empty asked the scarecrow looking curiously into the box  of course it is answered tip i shook out every grain of the powder  then the box has two bottoms announced the scarecrow for the bottom on the inside is fully an inch away from the bottom on the outside  let me see said the tin woodman taking the box from his friend yes he declared after looking it over the thing certainly has a false bottom now i wonder what that is for  can’t you get it apart and find out enquired tip now quite interested in the mystery  why yes the lower bottom unscrews said the tin woodman my fingers are rather stiff please see if you can open it  he handed the pepper-box to tip who had no difficulty in unscrewing the bottom and in the cavity below were three silver pills with a carefully folded paper lying underneath them  this paper the boy proceeded to unfold taking care not to spill the pills and found several lines clearly written in red ink  read it aloud said the scarecrow so tip read as follows   dr nikidik’s celebrated wishing pills  directions for use  swallow one pill count seventeen by twos then make a wish the wish will immediately be granted  caution  keep in a dry and dark place  why this is a very valuable discovery cried the scarecrow  it is indeed replied tip gravely these pills may be of great use to us i wonder if old mombi knew they were in the bottom of the pepper-box i remember hearing her say that she got the powder of life from this same nikidik  he must be a powerful sorcerer exclaimed the tin woodman and since the powder proved a success we ought to have confidence in the pills  but how asked the scarecrow can anyone count seventeen by twos seventeen is an odd number  that is true replied tip greatly disappointed no one can possibly count seventeen by twos  then the pills are of no use to us wailed the pumpkinhead and this fact overwhelms me with grief for i had intended wishing that my head would never spoil  nonsense said the scarecrow sharply if we could use the pills at all we would make far better wishes than that  i do not see how anything could be better protested poor jack if you were liable to spoil at any time you could understand my anxiety  for my part said the tin woodman i sympathize with you in every respect but since we cannot count seventeen by twos sympathy is all you are liable to get  by this time it had become quite dark and the voyagers found above them a cloudy sky through which the rays of the moon could not penetrate  the gump flew steadily on and for some reason the huge sofa-body rocked more and more dizzily every hour  the woggle-bug declared he was sea-sick and tip was also pale and somewhat distressed but the others clung to the backs of the sofas and did not seem to mind the motion as long as they were not tipped out  darker and darker grew the night and on and on sped the gump through the black heavens the travelers could not even see one another and an oppressive silence settled down upon them  after a long time tip who had been thinking deeply spoke  how are we to know when we come to the pallace of glinda the good he asked  it’s a long way to glinda’s palace answered the woodman i’ve traveled it  but how are we to know how fast the gump is flying persisted the boy we cannot see a single thing down on the earth and before morning we may be far beyond the place we want to reach  that is all true enough the scarecrow replied a little uneasily but i do not see how we can stop just now for we might alight in a river or on the top of a steeple and that would be a great disaster  so they permitted the gump to fly on with regular flops of its great wings and waited patiently for morning  then tip’s fears were proven to be well founded for with the first streaks of gray dawn they looked over the sides of the sofas and discovered rolling plains dotted with queer villages where the houses instead of being dome-shaped—as they all are in the land of oz—had slanting roofs that rose to a peak in the center odd looking animals were also moving about upon the open plains and the country was unfamiliar to both the tin woodman and the scarecrow who had formerly visited glinda the good’s domain and knew it well  we are lost said the scarecrow dolefully the gump must have carried us entirely out of the land of oz and over the sandy deserts and into the terrible outside world that dorothy told us about  we must get back exclaimed the tin woodman earnestly we must get back as soon as possible  turn around cried tip to the gump turn as quickly as you can  if i do i shall upset answered the gump i’m not at all used to flying and the best plan would be for me to alight in some place and then i can turn around and take a fresh start  just then however there seemed to be no stopping-place that would answer their purpose they flew over a village so big that the woggle-bug declared it was a city and then they came to a range of high mountains with many deep gorges and steep cliffs showing plainly  now is our chance to stop said the boy finding they were very close to the mountain tops then he turned to the gump and commanded  stop at the first level place you see  very well answered the gump and settled down upon a table of rock that stood between two cliffs  but not being experienced in such matters the gump did not judge his speed correctly and instead of coming to a stop upon the flat rock he missed it by half the width of his body breaking off both his right wings against the sharp edge of the rock and then tumbling over and over down the cliff  our friends held on to the sofas as long as they could but when the gump caught on a projecting rock the thing stopped suddenly—bottom side up—and all were immediately dumped out  [illustration  image239]  by good fortune they fell only a few feet for underneath them was a monster nest built by a colony of jackdaws in a hollow ledge of rock so none of them—not even the pumpkinhead—was injured by the fall for jack found his precious head resting on the soft breast of the scarecrow which made an excellent cushion and tip fell on a mass of leaves and papers which saved him from injury the woggle-bug had bumped his round head against the saw-horse but without causing him more than a moment’s inconvenience  the tin woodman was at first much alarmed but finding he had escaped without even a scratch upon his beautiful nickle-plate he at once regained his accustomed cheerfulness and turned to address his comrades  our journey had ended rather suddenly said he and we cannot justly blame our friend the gump for our accident because he did the best he could under the circumstances but how we are ever to escape from this nest i must leave to someone with better brains than i possess  here he gazed at the scarecrow who crawled to the edge of the nest and looked over below them was a sheer precipice several hundred feet in depth above them was a smooth cliff unbroken save by the point of rock where the wrecked body of the gump still hung suspended from the end of one of the sofas there really seemed to be no means of escape and as they realized their helpless plight the little band of adventurers gave way to their bewilderment  this is a worse prison than the palace sadly remarked the woggle-bug  i wish we had stayed there moaned jack  i’m afraid the mountain air isn’t good for pumpkins  it won’t be when the jackdaws come back growled the saw-horse which lay waving its legs in a vain endeavor to get upon its feet again jackdaws are especially fond of pumpkins  do you think the birds will come here asked jack much distressed  of course they will said tip for this is their nest and there must be hundreds of them he continued for see what a lot of things they have brought here  indeed the nest was half filled with a most curious collection of small articles for which the birds could have no use but which the thieving jackdaws had stolen during many years from the homes of men and as the nest was safely hidden where no human being could reach it this lost property would never be recovered  [illustration  image242]  the woggle-bug searching among the rubbish—for the jackdaws stole useless things as well as valuable ones—turned up with his foot a beautiful diamond necklace this was so greatly admired by the tin woodman that the woggle-bug presented it to him with a graceful speech after which the woodman hung it around his neck with much pride rejoicing exceedingly when the big diamonds glittered in the sun’s rays  but now they heard a great jabbering and flopping of wings and as the sound grew nearer to them tip exclaimed   the jackdaws are coming and if they find us here they will surely kill us in their anger  i was afraid of this moaned the pumpkinhead my time has come  and mine also said the woggle-bug for jackdaws are the greatest enemies of my race  the others were not at all afraid but the scarecrow at once decided to save those of the party who were liable to be injured by the angry birds so he commanded tip to take off jack’s head and lie down with it in the bottom of the nest and when this was done he ordered the woggle-bug to lie beside tip nick chopper who knew from past experience just what to do then took the scarecrow to pieces all except his head and scattered the straw over tip and the woggle-bug completely covering their bodies  hardly had this been accomplished when the flock of jackdaws reached them perceiving the intruders in their nest the birds flew down upon them with screams of rage  [illustration  image244]  [illustration  image245]     dr nikidik’s famous wishing pills   the tin woodman was usually a peaceful man but when occasion required he could fight as fiercely as a roman gladiator so when the jackdaws nearly knocked him down in their rush of wings and their sharp beaks and claws threatened to damage his brilliant plating the woodman picked up his axe and made it whirl swiftly around his head  but although many were beaten off in this way the birds were so numerous and so brave that they continued the attack as furiously as before some of them pecked at the eyes of the gump which hung over the nest in a helpless condition but the gump’s eyes were of glass and could not be injured others of the jackdaws rushed at the saw-horse but that animal being still upon his back kicked out so viciously with his wooden legs that he beat off as many assailants as did the woodman’s axe  finding themselves thus opposed the birds fell upon the scarecrow’s straw which lay at the center of the nest covering tip and the woggle-bug and jack’s pumpkin head and began tearing it away and flying off with it only to let it drop straw by straw into the great gulf beneath  [illustration  image247]  the scarecrow’s head noting with dismay this wanton destruction of his interior cried to the tin woodman to save him and that good friend responded with renewed energy his axe fairly flashed among the jackdaws and fortunately the gump began wildly waving the two wings remaining on the left side of its body the flutter of these great wings filled the jackdaws with terror and when the gump by its exertions freed itself from the peg of rock on which it hung and sank flopping into the nest the alarm of the birds knew no bounds and they fled screaming over the mountains  when the last foe had disappeared tip crawled from under the sofas and assisted the woggle-bug to follow him  we are saved shouted the boy delightedly  we are indeed responded the educated insect fairly hugging the stiff head of the gump in his joy and we owe it all to the flopping of the thing and the good axe of the woodman  if i am saved get me out of here called jack whose head was still beneath the sofas and tip managed to roll the pumpkin out and place it upon its neck again he also set the saw-horse upright and said to it   we owe you many thanks for the gallant fight you made  i really think we have escaped very nicely remarked the tin woodman in a tone of pride  not so exclaimed a hollow voice  at this they all turned in surprise to look at the scarecrow’s head which lay at the back of the nest  i am completely ruined declared the scarecrow as he noted their astonishment for where is the straw that stuffs my body  the awful question startled them all they gazed around the nest with horror for not a vestige of straw remained the jackdaws had stolen it to the last wisp and flung it all into the chasm that yawned for hundreds of feet beneath the nest  [illustration  image249]  my poor poor friend said the tin woodman taking up the scarecrow’s head and caressing it tenderly whoever could imagine you would come to this untimely end  i did it to save my friends returned the head and i am glad that i perished in so noble and unselfish a manner  but why are you all so despondent inquired the woggle-bug the scarecrow’s clothing is still safe  yes answered the tin woodman but our friend’s clothes are useless without stuffing  why not stuff him with money asked tip  money they all cried in an amazed chorus  to be sure said the boy in the bottom of the nest are thousands of dollar bills—and two-dollar bills—and five-dollar bills—and tens and twenties and fifties there are enough of them to stuff a dozen scarecrows why not use the money  the tin woodman began to turn over the rubbish with the handle of his axe and sure enough what they had first thought only worthless papers were found to be all bills of various denominations which the mischievous jackdaws had for years been engaged in stealing from the villages and cities they visited  there was an immense fortune lying in that inaccessible nest and tip’s suggestion was with the scarecrow’s consent quickly acted upon  they selected all the newest and cleanest bills and assorted them into various piles the scarecrow’s left leg and boot were stuffed with five-dollar bills his right leg was stuffed with ten-dollar bills and his body so closely filled with fifties one-hundreds and one-thousands that he could scarcely button his jacket with comfort  [illustration  image251]  you are now said the woggle-bug impressively when the task had been completed the most valuable member of our party and as you are among faithful friends there is little danger of your being spent  thank you returned the scarecrow gratefully i feel like a new man and although at first glance i might be mistaken for a safety deposit vault i beg you to remember that my brains are still composed of the same old material and these are the possessions that have always made me a person to be depended upon in an emergency  well the emergency is here observed tip and unless your brains help us out of it we shall be compelled to pass the remainder of our lives in this nest  how about these wishing pills enquired the scarecrow taking the box from his jacket pocket can’t we use them to escape  not unless we can count seventeen by twos answered the tin woodman but our friend the woggle-bug claims to be highly educated so he ought easily to figure out how that can be done  it isn’t a question of education returned the insect it’s merely a question of mathematics i’ve seen the professor work lots of sums on the blackboard and he claimed anything could be done with x’s and y’s and a’s and such things by mixing them up with plenty of plusses and minuses and equals and so forth but he never said anything so far as i can remember about counting up to the odd number of seventeen by the even numbers of twos  stop stop cried the pumpkinhead you’re making my head ache  and mine added the scarecrow your mathematics seem to me very like a bottle of mixed pickles the more you fish for what you want the less chance you have of getting it i am certain that if the thing can be accomplished at all it is in a very simple manner  yes said tip old mombi couldn’t use x’s and minuses for she never went to school  why not start counting at a half of one asked the saw-horse abruptly then anyone can count up to seventeen by twos very easily  they looked at each other in surprise for the saw-horse was considered the most stupid of the entire party  you make me quite ashamed of myself said the scarecrow bowing low to the saw-horse  nevertheless the creature is right declared the woggle-bug for twice one-half is one and if you get to one it is easy to count from one up to seventeen by twos  i wonder i didn’t think of that myself said the pumpkinhead  i don’t returned the scarecrow you’re no wiser than the rest of us are you but let us make a wish at once who will swallow the first pill  suppose you do it suggested tip  i can’t said the scarecrow  why not you’ve a mouth haven’t you asked the boy  yes but my mouth is painted on and there’s no swallow connected with it answered the scarecrow in fact he continued looking from one to another critically i believe the boy and the woggle-bug are the only ones in our party that are able to swallow  observing the truth of this remark tip said   then i will undertake to make the first wish give me one of the silver pills  this the scarecrow tried to do but his padded gloves were too clumsy to clutch so small an object and he held the box toward the boy while tip selected one of the pills and swallowed it  count cried the scarecrow  one-half one three five seven nine eleven counted tip thirteen fifteen seventeen  now wish said the tin woodman anxiously   but just then the boy began to suffer such fearful pains that he became alarmed  the pill has poisoned me he gasped o—h o-o-o-o-o ouch murder fire o-o-h and here he rolled upon the bottom of the nest in such contortions that he frightened them all  what can we do for you speak i beg entreated the tin woodman tears of sympathy running down his nickel cheeks  i—i don’t know answered tip o—h i wish i’d never swallowed that pill  then at once the pain stopped and the boy rose to his feet again and found the scarecrow looking with amazement at the end of the pepper-box  what’s happened asked the boy a little ashamed of his recent exhibition  why the three pills are in the box again said the scarecrow  of course they are the woggle-bug declared didn’t tip wish that he’d never swallowed one of them well the wish came true and he didn’t swallow one of them so of course they are all three in the box  that may be but the pill gave me a dreadful pain just the same said the boy  impossible declared the woggle-bug if you have never swallowed it the pill can not have given you a pain and as your wish being granted proves you did not swallow the pill it is also plain that you suffered no pain  [illustration  image255]  then it was a splendid imitation of a pain retorted tip angrily suppose you try the next pill yourself we’ve wasted one wish already  oh no we haven’t protested the scarecrow here are still three pills in the box and each pill is good for a wish  now you’re making my head ache said tip i can’t understand the thing at all but i won’t take another pill i promise you and with this remark he retired sulkily to the back of the nest  well said the woggle-bug it remains for me to save us in my most highly magnified and thoroughly educated manner for i seem to be the only one able and willing to make a wish let me have one of the pills  he swallowed it without hesitation and they all stood admiring his courage while the insect counted seventeen by twos in the same way that tip had done and for some reason—perhaps because woggle-bugs have stronger stomachs than boys—the silver pellet caused it no pain whatever  i wish the gump’s broken wings mended and as good as new said the woggle-bug in a slow impressive voice  all turned to look at the thing and so quickly had the wish been granted that the gump lay before them in perfect repair and as well able to fly through the air as when it had first been brought to life on the roof of the palace  [illustration  image257]  [illustration  image258]  [illustration  image259]     the scarecrow appeals to glinda the good   hooray shouted the scarecrow gaily we can now leave this miserable jackdaws’ nest whenever we please  but it is nearly dark said the tin woodman and unless we wait until morning to make our flight we may get into more trouble i don’t like these night trips for one never knows what will happen  so it was decided to wait until daylight and the adventurers amused themselves in the twilight by searching the jackdaws’ nest for treasures  the woggle-bug found two handsome bracelets of wrought gold which fitted his slender arms very well the scarecrow took a fancy for rings of which there were many in the nest before long he had fitted a ring to each finger of his padded gloves and not being content with that display he added one more to each thumb as he carefully chose those rings set with sparkling stones such as rubies amethysts and sapphires the scarecrow’s hands now presented a most brilliant appearance  this nest would be a picnic for queen jinjur said he musingly for as nearly as i can make out she and her girls conquered me merely to rob my city of its emeralds  the tin woodman was content with his diamond necklace and refused to accept any additional decorations but tip secured a fine gold watch which was attached to a heavy fob and placed it in his pocket with much pride he also pinned several jeweled brooches to jack pumpkinhead’s red waistcoat and attached a lorgnette by means of a fine chain to the neck of the saw-horse  it’s very pretty said the creature regarding the lorgnette approvingly but what is it for  none of them could answer that question however so the saw-horse decided it was some rare decoration and became very fond of it  that none of the party might be slighted they ended by placing several large seal rings upon the points of the gump’s antlers although that odd personage seemed by no means gratified by the attention  darkness soon fell upon them and tip and the woggle-bug went to sleep while the others sat down to wait patiently for the day  next morning they had cause to congratulate themselves upon the useful condition of the gump for with daylight a great flock of jackdaws approached to engage in one more battle for the possession of the nest  but our adventurers did not wait for the assault they tumbled into the cushioned seats of the sofas as quickly as possible and tip gave the word to the gump to start  at once it rose into the air the great wings flopping strongly and with regular motions and in a few moments they were so far from the nest that the chattering jackdaws took possession without any attempt at pursuit  the thing flew due north going in the same direction from whence it had come at least that was the scarecrow’s opinion and the others agreed that the scarecrow was the best judge of direction after passing over several cities and villages the gump carried them high above a broad plain where houses became more and more scattered until they disappeared altogether next came the wide sandy desert separating the rest of the world from the land of oz and before noon they saw the dome-shaped houses that proved they were once more within the borders of their native land  but the houses and fences are blue said the tin woodman and that indicates we are in the land of the munchkins and therefore a long distance from glinda the good  what shall we do asked the boy turning to their guide  i don’t know replied the scarecrow frankly if we were at the emerald city we could then move directly southward and so reach our destination but we dare not go to the emerald city and the gump is probably carrying us further in the wrong direction with every flop of its wings  then the woggle-bug must swallow another pill said tip decidedly and wish us headed in the right direction  very well returned the highly magnified one i’m willing  but when the scarecrow searched in his pocket for the pepper-box containing the two silver wishing pills it was not to be found filled with anxiety the voyagers hunted throughout every inch of the thing for the precious box but it had disappeared entirely  and still the gump flew onward carrying them they knew not where  i must have left the pepper-box in the jackdaws’ nest said the scarecrow at length  it is a great misfortune the tin woodman declared but we are no worse off than before we discovered the wishing pills  we are better off replied tip for the one pill we used has enabled us to escape from that horrible nest  yet the loss of the other two is serious and i deserve a good scolding for my carelessness the scarecrow rejoined penitently for in such an unusual party as this accidents are liable to happen any moment and even now we may be approaching a new danger  no one dared contradict this and a dismal silence ensued  the gump flew steadily on  suddenly tip uttered an exclamation of surprise we must have reached the south country he cried for below us everything is red  immediately they all leaned over the backs of the sofas to look—all except jack who was too careful of his pumpkin head to risk its slipping off his neck sure enough the red houses and fences and trees indicated they were within the domain of glinda the good and presently as they glided rapidly on the tin woodman recognized the roads and buildings they passed and altered slightly the flight of the gump so that they might reach the palace of the celebrated sorceress  [illustration  image264]  good cried the scarecrow delightedly we do not need the lost wishing pills now for we have arrived at our destination  gradually the thing sank lower and nearer to the ground until at length it came to rest within the beautiful gardens of glinda settling upon a velvety green lawn close by a fountain which sent sprays of flashing gems instead of water high into the air whence they fell with a soft tinkling sound into the carved marble basin placed to receive them  everything was very gorgeous in glinda’s gardens and while our voyagers gazed about with admiring eyes a company of soldiers silently appeared and surrounded them but these soldiers of the great sorceress were entirely different from those of jinjur’s army of revolt although they were likewise girls for glinda’s soldiers wore neat uniforms and bore swords and spears and they marched with a skill and precision that proved them well trained in the arts of war  the captain commanding this troop—which was glinda’s private body guard—recognized the scarecrow and the tin woodman at once and greeted them with respectful salutations  good day said the scarecrow gallantly removing his hat while the woodman gave a soldierly salute we have come to request an audience with your fair ruler  glinda is now within her palace awaiting you returned the captain for she saw you coming long before you arrived  that is strange said tip wondering  not at all answered the scarecrow for glinda the good is a mighty sorceress and nothing that goes on in the land of oz escapes her notice i suppose she knows why we came as well as we do ourselves  then what was the use of our coming asked jack stupidly  to prove you are a pumpkinhead retorted the scarecrow but if the sorceress expects us we must not keep her waiting  so they all clambered out of the sofas and followed the captain toward the palace—even the saw-horse taking his place in the queer procession  upon her throne of finely wrought gold sat glinda and she could scarcely repress a smile as her peculiar visitors entered and bowed before her both the scarecrow and the tin woodman she knew and liked but the awkward pumpkinhead and highly magnified woggle-bug were creatures she had never seen before and they seemed even more curious than the others as for the saw-horse he looked to be nothing more than an animated chunk of wood and he bowed so stiffly that his head bumped against the floor causing a ripple of laughter among the soldiers in which glinda frankly joined  [illustration  image266]  i beg to announce to your glorious highness began the scarecrow in a solemn voice that my emerald city has been overrun by a crowd of impudent girls with knitting-needles who have enslaved all the men robbed the streets and public buildings of all their emerald jewels and usurped my throne  i know it said glinda  they also threatened to destroy me as well as all the good friends and allies you see before you continued the scarecrow and had we not managed to escape their clutches our days would long since have ended  i know it repeated glinda  therefore i have come to beg your assistance resumed the scarecrow for i believe you are always glad to succor the unfortunate and oppressed  that is true replied the sorceress slowly but the emerald city is now ruled by general jinjur w queen what right have i to oppose her  why she stole the throne from me said the scarecrow  and how came you to possess the throne asked glinda  i got it from the wizard of oz and by the choice of the people returned the scarecrow uneasy at such questioning  and where did the wizard get it she continued gravely  i am told he took it from pastoria the former king said the scarecrow becoming confused under the intent look of the sorceress  then declared glinda the throne of the emerald city belongs neither to you nor to jinjur but to this pastoria from whom the wizard usurped it  that is true acknowledged the scarecrow humbly but pastoria is now dead and gone and some one must rule in his place  pastoria had a daughter who is the rightful heir to the throne of the emerald city did you know that questioned the sorceress  no replied the scarecrow but if the girl still lives i will not stand in her way it will satisfy me as well to have jinjur turned out as an impostor as to regain the throne myself in fact it isn’t much fun to be king especially if one has good brains i have known for some time that i am fitted to occupy a far more exalted position but where is the girl who owns the throne and what is her name  her name is ozma answered glinda but where she is i have tried in vain to discover for the wizard of oz when he stole the throne from ozma’s father hid the girl in some secret place and by means of a magical trick with which i am not familiar he also managed to prevent her being discovered—even by so experienced a sorceress as myself  that is strange interrupted the woggle-bug pompously i have been informed that the wonderful wizard of oz was nothing more than a humbug  nonsense exclaimed the scarecrow much provoked by this speech didn’t he give me a wonderful set of brains  there’s no humbug about my heart announced the tin woodman glaring indignantly at the woggle-bug  perhaps i was misinformed stammered the insect shrinking back i never knew the wizard personally  well we did retorted the scarecrow and he was a very great wizard i assure you it is true he was guilty of some slight impostures but unless he was a great wizard how—let me ask—could he have hidden this girl ozma so securely that no one can find her  i—i give it up replied the woggle-bug meekly  that is the most sensible speech you’ve made said the tin woodman  i must really make another effort to discover where this girl is hidden resumed the sorceress thoughtfully i have in my library a book in which is inscribed every action of the wizard while he was in our land of oz—or at least every action that could be observed by my spies this book i will read carefully tonight and try to single out the acts that may guide us in discovering the lost ozma in the meantime pray amuse yourselves in my palace and command my servants as if they were your own i will grant you another audience tomorrow  [illustration  image271]  with this gracious speech glinda dismissed the adventurers and they wandered away through the beautiful gardens where they passed several hours enjoying all the delightful things with which the queen of the southland had surrounded her royal palace  on the following morning they again appeared before glinda who said to them   i have searched carefully through the records of the wizard’s actions and among them i can find but three that appear to have been suspicious he ate beans with a knife made three secret visits to old mombi and limped slightly on his left foot  ah that last is certainly suspicious exclaimed the pumpkinhead  not necessarily said the scarecrow he may have had corns now it seems to me his eating beans with a knife is more suspicious  perhaps it is a polite custom in omaha from which great country the wizard originally came suggested the tin woodman  it may be admitted the scarecrow  but why asked glinda did he make three secret visits to old mombi  ah why indeed echoed the woggle-bug impressively  we know that the wizard taught the old woman many of his tricks of magic continued glinda and this he would not have done had she not assisted him in some way so we may suspect with good reason that mombi aided him to hide the girl ozma who was the real heir to the throne of the emerald city and a constant danger to the usurper for if the people knew that she lived they would quickly make her their queen and restore her to her rightful position  an able argument cried the scarecrow i have no doubt that mombi was mixed up in this wicked business but how does that knowledge help us  we must find mombi replied glinda and force her to tell where the girl is hidden  mombi is now with queen jinjur in the emerald city said tip it was she who threw so many obstacles in our pathway and made jinjur threaten to destroy my friends and give me back into the old witch’s power  then decided glinda i will march with my army to the emerald city and take mombi prisoner after that we can perhaps force her to tell the truth about ozma  she is a terrible old woman remarked tip with a shudder at the thought of mombi’s black kettle and obstinate too  i am quite obstinate myself returned the sorceress with a sweet smile so i do not fear mombi in the least today i will make all necessary preparations and we will march upon the emerald city at daybreak tomorrow  [illustration  image275]  [illustration  image276]  [illustration  image277]     the tin-woodman plucks a rose   the army of glinda the good looked very grand and imposing when it assembled at daybreak before the palace gates the uniforms of the girl soldiers were pretty and of gay colors and their silver-tipped spears were bright and glistening the long shafts being inlaid with mother-of-pearl all the officers wore sharp gleaming swords and shields edged with peacock-feathers and it really seemed that no foe could by any possibility defeat such a brilliant army  the sorceress rode in a beautiful palanquin which was like the body of a coach having doors and windows with silken curtains but instead of wheels which a coach has the palanquin rested upon two long horizontal bars which were borne upon the shoulders of twelve servants  the scarecrow and his comrades decided to ride in the gump in order to keep up with the swift march of the army so as soon as glinda had started and her soldiers had marched away to the inspiring strains of music played by the royal band our friends climbed into the sofas and followed the gump flew along slowly at a point directly over the palanquin in which rode the sorceress  [illustration  image278]  be careful said the tin woodman to the scarecrow who was leaning far over the side to look at the army below you might fall  it wouldn’t matter remarked the educated woggle-bug he can’t get broke so long as he is stuffed with money  didn’t i ask you began tip in a reproachful voice  you did said the woggle-bug promptly and i beg your pardon i will really try to restrain myself  you’d better declared the boy that is if you wish to travel in our company  ah i couldn’t bear to part with you now murmured the insect feelingly so tip let the subject drop  the army moved steadily on but night had fallen before they came to the walls of the emerald city by the dim light of the new moon however glinda’s forces silently surrounded the city and pitched their tents of scarlet silk upon the greensward the tent of the sorceress was larger than the others and was composed of pure white silk with scarlet banners flying above it a tent was also pitched for the scarecrow’s party and when these preparations had been made with military precision and quickness the army retired to rest  great was the amazement of queen jinjur next morning when her soldiers came running to inform her of the vast army surrounding them she at once climbed to a high tower of the royal palace and saw banners waving in every direction and the great white tent of glinda standing directly before the gates  we are surely lost cried jinjur in despair for how can our knitting-needles avail against the long spears and terrible swords of our foes  the best thing we can do said one of the girls is to surrender as quickly as possible before we get hurt  not so returned jinjur more bravely the enemy is still outside the walls so we must try to gain time by engaging them in parley go you with a flag of truce to glinda and ask her why she has dared to invade my dominions and what are her demands  so the girl passed through the gates bearing a white flag to show she was on a mission of peace and came to glinda’s tent tell your queen said the sorceress to the girl that she must deliver up to me old mombi to be my prisoner if this is done i will not molest her farther  [illustration  image280]  now when this message was delivered to the queen it filled her with dismay for mombi was her chief counsellor and jinjur was terribly afraid of the old hag but she sent for mombi and told her what glinda had said  i see trouble ahead for all of us muttered the old witch after glancing into a magic mirror she carried in her pocket but we may even yet escape by deceiving this sorceress clever as she thinks herself  don’t you think it will be safer for me to deliver you into her hands asked jinjur nervously  if you do it will cost you the throne of the emerald city answered the witch positively but if you will let me have my own way i can save us both very easily  then do as you please replied jinjur for it is so aristocratic to be a queen that i do not wish to be obliged to return home again to make beds and wash dishes for my mother  so mombi called jellia jamb to her and performed a certain magical rite with which she was familiar as a result of the enchantment jellia took on the form and features of mombi while the old witch grew to resemble the girl so closely that it seemed impossible anyone could guess the deception  now said old mombi to the queen let your soldiers deliver up this girl to glinda she will think she has the real mombi in her power and so will return immediately to her own country in the south  [illustration  image282]  therefore jellia hobbling along like an aged woman was led from the city gates and taken before glinda  here is the person you demanded said one of the guards and our queen now begs you will go away as you promised and leave us in peace  that i will surely do replied glinda much pleased if this is really the person she seems to be  it is certainly old mombi said the guard who believed she was speaking the truth and then jinjur’s soldiers returned within the city’s gates  the sorceress quickly summoned the scarecrow and his friends to her tent and began to question the supposed mombi about the lost girl ozma but jellia knew nothing at all of this affair and presently she grew so nervous under the questioning that she gave way and began to weep to glinda’s great astonishment  here is some foolish trickery said the sorceress her eyes flashing with anger this is not mombi at all but some other person who has been made to resemble her tell me she demanded turning to the trembling girl what is your name  this jellia dared not tell having been threatened with death by the witch if she confessed the fraud but glinda sweet and fair though she was understood magic better than any other person in the land of oz so by uttering a few potent words and making a peculiar gesture she quickly transformed the girl into her proper shape while at the same time old mombi far away in jinjur’s palace suddenly resumed her own crooked form and evil features  why it’s jellia jamb cried the scarecrow recognizing in the girl one of his old friends  it’s our interpreter said the pumpkinhead smiling pleasantly  [illustration  image284]  then jellia was forced to tell of the trick mombi had played and she also begged glinda’s protection which the sorceress readily granted but glinda was now really angry and sent word to jinjur that the fraud was discovered and she must deliver up the real mombi or suffer terrible consequences jinjur was prepared for this message for the witch well understood when her natural form was thrust upon her that glinda had discovered her trickery but the wicked old creature had already thought up a new deception and had made jinjur promise to carry it out so the queen said to glinda’s messenger   tell your mistress that i cannot find mombi anywhere but that glinda is welcome to enter the city and search herself for the old woman she may also bring her friends with her if she likes but if she does not find mombi by sundown the sorceress must promise to go away peaceably and bother us no more  glinda agreed to these terms well knowing that mombi was somewhere within the city walls so jinjur caused the gates to be thrown open and glinda marched in at the head of a company of soldiers followed by the scarecrow and the tin woodman while jack pumpkinhead rode astride the saw-horse and the educated highly magnified woggle-bug sauntered behind in a dignified manner tip walked by the side of the sorceress for glinda had conceived a great liking for the boy  of course old mombi had no intention of being found by glinda so while her enemies were marching up the street the witch transformed herself into a red rose growing upon a bush in the garden of the palace it was a clever idea and a trick glinda did not suspect so several precious hours were spent in a vain search for mombi  as sundown approached the sorceress realized she had been defeated by the superior cunning of the aged witch so she gave the command to her people to march out of the city and back to their tents  the scarecrow and his comrades happened to be searching in the garden of the palace just then and they turned with disappointment to obey glinda’s command but before they left the garden the tin woodman who was fond of flowers chanced to espy a big red rose growing upon a bush so he plucked the flower and fastened it securely in the tin buttonhole of his tin bosom  [illustration  image285]  as he did this he fancied he heard a low moan proceed from the rose but he paid no attention to the sound and mombi was thus carried out of the city and into glinda’s camp without anyone having a suspicion that they had succeeded in their quest  [illustration  image288]  [illustration  image289]     the transformation of old mombi   the witch was at first frightened at finding herself captured by the enemy but soon she decided that she was exactly as safe in the tin woodman’s button-hole as growing upon the bush for no one knew the rose and mombi to be one and now that she was without the gates of the city her chances of escaping altogether from glinda were much improved  but there is no hurry thought mombi i will wait awhile and enjoy the humiliation of this sorceress when she finds i have outwitted her so throughout the night the rose lay quietly on the woodman’s bosom and in the morning when glinda summoned our friends to a consultation nick chopper carried his pretty flower with him to the white silk tent  for some reason said glinda we have failed to find this cunning old mombi so i fear our expedition will prove a failure and for that i am sorry because without our assistance little ozma will never be rescued and restored to her rightful position as queen of the emerald city  do not let us give up so easily said the pumpkinhead let us do something else  something else must really be done replied glinda with a smile yet i cannot understand how i have been defeated so easily by an old witch who knows far less of magic than i do myself  while we are on the ground i believe it would be wise for us to conquer the emerald city for princess ozma and find the girl afterward said the scarecrow and while the girl remains hidden i will gladly rule in her place for i understand the business of ruling much better than jinjur does  but i have promised not to molest jinjur objected glinda  [illustration  image290]  suppose you all return with me to my kingdom—or empire rather said the tin woodman politely including the entire party in a royal wave of his arm it will give me great pleasure to entertain you in my castle where there is room enough and to spare and if any of you wish to be nickel-plated my valet will do it free of all expense  while the woodman was speaking glinda’s eyes had been noting the rose in his button-hole and now she imagined she saw the big red leaves of the flower tremble slightly this quickly aroused her suspicions and in a moment more the sorceress had decided that the seeming rose was nothing else than a transformation of old mombi at the same instant mombi knew she was discovered and must quickly plan an escape and as transformations were easy to her she immediately took the form of a shadow and glided along the wall of the tent toward the entrance thinking thus to disappear  but glinda had not only equal cunning but far more experience than the witch so the sorceress reached the opening of the tent before the shadow and with a wave of her hand closed the entrance so securely that mombi could not find a crack big enough to creep through the scarecrow and his friends were greatly surprised at glinda’s actions for none of them had noted the shadow but the sorceress said to them   remain perfectly quiet all of you for the old witch is even now with us in this tent and i hope to capture her  these words so alarmed mombi that she quickly transformed herself from a shadow to a black ant in which shape she crawled along the ground seeking a crack or crevice in which to hide her tiny body  [illustration  image293]  fortunately the ground where the tent had been pitched being just before the city gates was hard and smooth and while the ant still crawled about glinda discovered it and ran quickly forward to effect its capture but just as her hand was descending the witch now fairly frantic with fear made her last transformation and in the form of a huge griffin sprang through the wall of the tent—tearing the silk asunder in her rush—and in a moment had darted away with the speed of a whirlwind  glinda did not hesitate to follow she sprang upon the back of the saw-horse and cried   now you shall prove that you have a right to be alive run—run—run  the saw-horse ran like a flash he followed the griffin his wooden legs moving so fast that they twinkled like the rays of a star before our friends could recover from their surprise both the griffin and the saw-horse had dashed out of sight  come let us follow cried the scarecrow  they ran to the place where the gump was lying and quickly tumbled aboard  fly commanded tip eagerly  where to asked the gump in its calm voice  i don’t know returned tip who was very nervous at the delay but if you will mount into the air i think we can discover which way glinda has gone  very well returned the gump quietly and it spread its great wings and mounted high into the air  [illustration  image295]  far away across the meadows they could now see two tiny specks speeding one after the other and they knew these specks must be the griffin and the saw-horse so tip called the gump’s attention to them and bade the creature try to overtake the witch and the sorceress but swift as was the gump’s flight the pursued and pursuer moved more swiftly yet and within a few moments were blotted out against the dim horizon  let us continue to follow them nevertheless said the scarecrow for the land of oz is of small extent and sooner or later they must both come to a halt  old mombi had thought herself very wise to choose the form of a griffin for its legs were exceedingly fleet and its strength more enduring than that of other animals but she had not reckoned on the untiring energy of the saw-horse whose wooden limbs could run for days without slacking their speed therefore after an hour’s hard running the griffin’s breath began to fail and it panted and gasped painfully and moved more slowly than before then it reached the edge of the desert and began racing across the deep sands but its tired feet sank far into the sand and in a few minutes the griffin fell forward completely exhausted and lay still upon the desert waste  glinda came up a moment later riding the still vigorous saw-horse and having unwound a slender golden thread from her girdle the sorceress threw it over the head of the panting and helpless griffin and so destroyed the magical power of mombi’s transformation  for the animal with one fierce shudder disappeared from view while in its place was discovered the form of the old witch glaring savagely at the serene and beautiful face of the sorceress  [illustration  image297]  [illustration  image298]  [illustration  image299]     princess ozma of oz   you are my prisoner and it is useless for you to struggle any longer said glinda in her soft sweet voice lie still a moment and rest yourself and then i will carry you back to my tent  why do you seek me asked mombi still scarce able to speak plainly for lack of breath what have i done to you to be so persecuted  you have done nothing to me answered the gentle sorceress but i suspect you have been guilty of several wicked actions and if i find it is true that you have so abused your knowledge of magic i intend to punish you severely  i defy you croaked the old hag you dare not harm me  just then the gump flew up to them and alighted upon the desert sands beside glinda our friends were delighted to find that mombi had finally been captured and after a hurried consultation it was decided they should all return to the camp in the gump so the saw-horse was tossed aboard and then glinda still holding an end of the golden thread that was around mombi’s neck forced her prisoner to climb into the sofas the others now followed and tip gave the word to the gump to return  the journey was made in safety mombi sitting in her place with a grim and sullen air for the old hag was absolutely helpless so long as the magical thread encircled her throat the army hailed glinda’s return with loud cheers and the party of friends soon gathered again in the royal tent which had been neatly repaired during their absence  now said the sorceress to mombi i want you to tell us why the wonderful wizard of oz paid you three visits and what became of the child ozma which so curiously disappeared  the witch looked at glinda defiantly but said not a word  answer me cried the sorceress  but still mombi remained silent  perhaps she doesn’t know remarked jack  i beg you will keep quiet said tip you might spoil everything with your foolishness  very well dear father returned the pumpkinhead meekly  how glad i am to be a woggle-bug murmured the highly magnified insect softly no one can expect wisdom to flow from a pumpkin  well said the scarecrow what shall we do to make mombi speak unless she tells us what we wish to know her capture will do us no good at all  suppose we try kindness suggested the tin woodman i’ve heard that anyone can be conquered with kindness no matter how ugly they may be  at this the witch turned to glare upon him so horribly that the tin woodman shrank back abashed  glinda had been carefully considering what to do and now she turned to mombi and said   you will gain nothing i assure you by thus defying us for i am determined to learn the truth about the girl ozma and unless you tell me all that you know i will certainly put you to death  oh no don’t do that exclaimed the tin woodman it would be an awful thing to kill anyone—even old mombi  but it is merely a threat returned glinda i shall not put mombi to death because she will prefer to tell me the truth  oh i see said the tin man much relieved  suppose i tell you all that you wish to know said mombi speaking so suddenly that she startled them all what will you do with me then  in that case replied glinda i shall merely ask you to drink a powerful draught which will cause you to forget all the magic you have ever learned  then i would become a helpless old woman  but you would be alive suggested the pumpkinhead consolingly  do try to keep silent said tip nervously  i’ll try responded jack but you will admit that it’s a good thing to be alive  especially if one happens to be thoroughly educated added the woggle-bug nodding approval  you may make your choice glinda said to old mombi between death if you remain silent and the loss of your magical powers if you tell me the truth but i think you will prefer to live  mombi cast an uneasy glance at the sorceress and saw that she was in earnest and not to be trifled with so she replied slowly   i will answer your questions  that is what i expected said glinda pleasantly you have chosen wisely i assure you  she then motioned to one of her captains who brought her a beautiful golden casket from this the sorceress drew an immense white pearl attached to a slender chain which she placed around her neck in such a way that the pearl rested upon her bosom directly over her heart  now said she i will ask my first question  why did the wizard pay you three visits  because i would not come to him answered mombi  that is no answer said glinda sternly tell me the truth  well returned mombi with downcast eyes he visited me to learn the way i make tea-biscuits  look up commanded the sorceress  mombi obeyed  what is the color of my pearl demanded glinda  why—it is black replied the old witch in a tone of wonder  then you have told me a falsehood cried glinda angrily only when the truth is spoken will my magic pearl remain a pure white in color  mombi now saw how useless it was to try to deceive the sorceress so she said meanwhile scowling at her defeat   the wizard brought to me the girl ozma who was then no more than a baby and begged me to conceal the child  that is what i thought declared glinda calmly what did he give you for thus serving him  he taught me all the magical tricks he knew some were good tricks and some were only frauds but i have remained faithful to my promise  what did you do with the girl asked glinda and at this question everyone bent forward and listened eagerly for the reply  i enchanted her answered mombi  in what way  i transformed her into—into—  into what demanded glinda as the witch hesitated  into a boy said mombi in a low tone  a boy echoed every voice and then because they knew that this old woman had reared tip from childhood all eyes were turned to where the boy stood  yes said the old witch nodding her head that is the princess ozma—the child brought to me by the wizard who stole her father’s throne that is the rightful ruler of the emerald city and she pointed her long bony finger straight at the boy  i cried tip in amazement why i’m no princess ozma—i’m not a girl  glinda smiled and going to tip she took his small brown hand within her dainty white one  you are not a girl just now said she gently because mombi transformed you into a boy but you were born a girl and also a princess so you must resume your proper form that you may become queen of the emerald city  oh let jinjur be the queen exclaimed tip ready to cry i want to stay a boy and travel with the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the woggle-bug and jack—yes and my friend the saw-horse—and the gump i don’t want to be a girl  never mind old chap said the tin woodman soothingly it don’t hurt to be a girl i’m told and we will all remain your faithful friends just the same and to be honest with you i’ve always considered girls nicer than boys  they’re just as nice anyway added the scarecrow patting tip affectionately upon the head  and they are equally good students proclaimed the woggle-bug i should like to become your tutor when you are transformed into a girl again  but—see here said jack pumpkinhead with a gasp  if you become a girl you can’t be my dear father any more  no answered tip laughing in spite of his anxiety and i shall not be sorry to escape the relationship then he added hesitatingly as he turned to glinda  i might try it for awhile-just to see how it seems you know but if i don’t like being a girl you must promise to change me into a boy again  really said the sorceress that is beyond my magic i never deal in transformations for they are not honest and no respectable sorceress likes to make things appear to be what they are not only unscrupulous witches use the art and therefore i must ask mombi to effect your release from her charm and restore you to your proper form it will be the last opportunity she will have to practice magic  now that the truth about princes ozma had been discovered mombi did not care what became of tip but she feared glinda’s anger and the boy generously promised to provide for mombi in her old age if he became the ruler of the emerald city so the witch consented to effect the transformation and preparations for the event were at once made  glinda ordered her own royal couch to be placed in the center of the tent it was piled high with cushions covered with rose-colored silk and from a golden railing above hung many folds of pink gossamer completely concealing the interior of the couch  the first act of the witch was to make the boy drink a potion which quickly sent him into a deep and dreamless sleep then the tin woodman and the woggle-bug bore him gently to the couch placed him upon the soft cushions and drew the gossamer hangings to shut him from all earthly view  the witch squatted upon the ground and kindled a tiny fire of dried herbs which she drew from her bosom when the blaze shot up and burned clearly old mombi scattered a handful of magical powder over the fire which straightway gave off a rich violet vapor filling all the tent with its fragrance and forcing the saw-horse to sneeze—although he had been warned to keep quiet  then while the others watched her curiously the hag chanted a rhythmical verse in words which no one understood and bent her lean body seven times back and forth over the fire and now the incantation seemed complete for the witch stood upright and cried the one word yeowa in a loud voice  the vapor floated away the atmosphere became clear again a whiff of fresh air filled the tent and the pink curtains of the couch trembled slightly as if stirred from within  glinda walked to the canopy and parted the silken hangings then she bent over the cushions reached out her hand and from the couch arose the form of a young girl fresh and beautiful as a may morning her eyes sparkled as two diamonds and her lips were tinted like a tourmaline all adown her back floated tresses of ruddy gold with a slender jeweled circlet confining them at the brow her robes of silken gauze floated around her like a cloud and dainty satin slippers shod her feet  at this exquisite vision tip’s old comrades stared in wonder for the space of a full minute and then every head bent low in honest admiration of the lovely princess ozma the girl herself cast one look into glinda’s bright face which glowed with pleasure and satisfaction and then turned upon the others speaking the words with sweet diffidence she said   i hope none of you will care less for me than you did before i’m just the same tip you know only—only—  only you’re different said the pumpkinhead and everyone thought it was the wisest speech he had ever made  [illustration  image303]     the riches of content   when the wonderful tidings reached the ears of queen jinjur—how mombi the witch had been captured how she had confessed her crime to glinda and how the long-lost princess ozma had been discovered in no less a personage than the boy tip—she wept real tears of grief and despair  to think she moaned that after having ruled as queen and lived in a palace i must go back to scrubbing floors and churning butter again it is too horrible to think of i will never consent  so when her soldiers who spent most of their time making fudge in the palace kitchens counseled jinjur to resist she listened to their foolish prattle and sent a sharp defiance to glinda the good and the princess ozma the result was a declaration of war and the very next day glinda marched upon the emerald city with pennants flying and bands playing and a forest of shining spears sparkling brightly beneath the sun’s rays  but when it came to the walls this brave assembly made a sudden halt for jinjur had closed and barred every gateway and the walls of the emerald city were builded high and thick with many blocks of green marble finding her advance thus baffled glinda bent her brows in deep thought while the woggle-bug said in his most positive tone   we must lay siege to the city and starve it into submission it is the only thing we can do  not so answered the scarecrow we still have the gump and the gump can still fly  the sorceress turned quickly at this speech and her face now wore a bright smile  you are right she exclaimed and certainly have reason to be proud of your brains let us go to the gump at once  so they passed through the ranks of the army until they came to the place near the scarecrow’s tent where the gump lay glinda and princess ozma mounted first and sat upon the sofas then the scarecrow and his friends climbed aboard and still there was room for a captain and three soldiers which glinda considered sufficient for a guard  [illustration  image305]  now at a word from the princess the queer thing they had called the gump flopped its palm-leaf wings and rose into the air carrying the party of adventurers high above the walls they hovered over the palace and soon perceived jinjur reclining in a hammock in the courtyard where she was comfortably reading a novel with a green cover and eating green chocolates confident that the walls would protect her from her enemies obeying a quick command the gump alighted safely in this very courtyard and before jinjur had time to do more than scream the captain and three soldiers leaped out and made the former queen a prisoner locking strong chains upon both her wrists  that act really ended the war for the army of revolt submitted as soon as they knew jinjur to be a captive and the captain marched in safety through the streets and up to the gates of the city which she threw wide open then the bands played their most stirring music while glinda’s army marched into the city and heralds proclaimed the conquest of the audacious jinjur and the accession of the beautiful princess ozma to the throne of her royal ancestors  [illustration  image306]  at once the men of the emerald city cast off their aprons and it is said that the women were so tired eating of their husbands’ cooking that they all hailed the conquest of jinjur with joy certain it is that rushing one and all to the kitchens of their houses the good wives prepared so delicious a feast for the weary men that harmony was immediately restored in every family  ozma’s first act was to oblige the army of revolt to return to her every emerald or other gem stolen from the public streets and buildings and so great was the number of precious stones picked from their settings by these vain girls that every one of the royal jewelers worked steadily for more than a month to replace them in their settings  meanwhile the army of revolt was disbanded and the girls sent home to their mothers on promise of good behavior jinjur was likewise released  ozma made the loveliest queen the emerald city had ever known and although she was so young and inexperienced she ruled her people with wisdom and justice for glinda gave her good advice on all occasions and the woggle-bug who was appointed to the important post of public educator was quite helpful to ozma when her royal duties grew perplexing  the girl in her gratitude to the gump for its services offered the creature any reward it might name  then replied the gump please take me to pieces i did not wish to be brought to life and i am greatly ashamed of my conglomerate personality once i was a monarch of the forest as my antlers fully prove but now in my present upholstered condition of servitude i am compelled to fly through the air—my legs being of no use to me whatever therefore i beg to be dispersed  so ozma ordered the gump taken apart the antlered head was again hung over the mantle-piece in the hall and the sofas were untied and placed in the reception parlors the broom tail resumed its accustomed duties in the kitchen and finally the scarecrow replaced all the clotheslines and ropes on the pegs from which he had taken them on the eventful day when the thing was constructed  you might think that was the end of the gump and so it was as a flying-machine but the head over the mantle-piece continued to talk whenever it took a notion to do so and it frequently startled with its abrupt questions the people who waited in the hall for an audience with the queen  the saw-horse being ozma’s personal property was tenderly cared for and often she rode the queer creature along the streets of the emerald city she had its wooden legs shod with gold to keep them from wearing out and the tinkle of these golden shoes upon the pavement always filled the queen’s subjects with awe as they thought upon this evidence of her magical powers  the wonderful wizard was never so wonderful as queen ozma the people said to one another in whispers for he claimed to do many things he could not do whereas our new queen does many things no one would ever expect her to accomplish  jack pumpkinhead remained with ozma to the end of his days and he did not spoil as soon as he had feared although he always remained as stupid as ever the woggle-bug tried to teach him several arts and sciences but jack was so poor a student that any attempt to educate him was soon abandoned  after glinda’s army had marched back home and peace was restored to the emerald city the tin woodman announced his intention to return to his own kingdom of the winkies  it isn’t a very big kingdom said he to ozma but for that very reason it is easier to rule and i have called myself an emperor because i am an absolute monarch and no one interferes in any way with my conduct of public or personal affairs when i get home i shall have a new coat of nickel plate for i have become somewhat marred and scratched lately and then i shall be glad to have you pay me a visit  thank you replied ozma some day i may accept the invitation but what is to become of the scarecrow  i shall return with my friend the tin woodman said the stuffed one seriously we have decided never to be parted in the future  [illustration  image309]  and i have made the scarecrow my royal treasurer explained the tin woodman for it has occurred to me that it is a good thing to have a royal treasurer who is made of money what do you think  i think said the little queen smiling that your friend must be the richest man in all the world  i am returned the scarecrow but not on account of my money for i consider brains far superior to money in every way you may have noticed that if one has money without brains he cannot use it to advantage but if one has brains without money they will enable him to live comfortably to the end of his days  at the same time declared the tin woodman you must acknowledge that a good heart is a thing that brains can not create and that money can not buy perhaps after all it is i who am the richest man in all the world  you are both rich my friends said ozma gently and your riches are the only riches worth having—the riches of content  [illustration  image313]  [illustration  image318]"@"The Marvelous Land of Oz"@"L.Frank Baum"

   [illustration  ozma]       to my readers   i know that some of you have been waiting for this story of the tin woodman because many of my correspondents have asked me time and again what ever became of the pretty munchkin girl whom nick chopper was engaged to marry before the wicked witch enchanted his axe and he traded his flesh for tin i too have wondered what became of her but until woot the wanderer interested himself in the matter the tin woodman knew no more than we did however he found her after many thrilling adventures as you will discover when you have read this story  i am delighted at the continued interest of both young and old in the oz stories a learned college professor recently wrote me to ask  for readers of what age are your books intended it puzzled me to answer that properly until i had looked over some of the letters i have received one says  i'm a little boy 5 years old and i just love your oz stories my sister who is writing this for me reads me the oz books but i wish i could read them myself another letter says  i'm a great girl 13 years old so you'll be surprised when i tell you i am not too old yet for the oz stories here's another letter  since i was a young girl i've never missed getting a baum book for christmas i'm married now but am as eager to get and read the oz stories as ever and still another writes  my good wife and i both more than 70 years of age believe that we find more real enjoyment in your oz books than in any other books we read considering these statements i wrote the college professor that my books are intended for all those whose hearts are young no matter what their ages may be  and while on this subject of letters i am reminded that a good many of my correspondents neglect to slip a 3-cent postage-stamp into their letters for the answer you are sending but one letter you know while i get so many hundreds of letters that to prepay postage on all the answers to them would be no small

285     [illustration  woot in court dress]     woot the wanderer    chapter 1   the tin woodman sat on his glittering tin throne in the handsome tin hall of his splendid tin castle in the winkie country of the land of oz beside him in a chair of woven straw sat his best friend the scarecrow of oz at times they spoke to one another of curious things they had seen and strange adventures they had known since first they two had met and become comrades but at times they were silent for these things had been talked over many times between them and they found themselves contented in merely being together speaking now and then a brief sentence to prove they were wide awake and attentive but then these two quaint persons never slept why should they sleep when they never tired  and now as the brilliant sun sank low over the winkie country of oz tinting the glistening tin towers and tin minarets of the tin castle with glorious sunset hues there approached along a winding pathway woot the wanderer who met at the castle entrance a winkie servant  the servants of the tin woodman all wore tin helmets and tin breastplates and uniforms covered with tiny tin discs sewed closely together on silver cloth so that their bodies sparkled as beautifully as did the tin castle and almost as beautifully as did the tin woodman himself  woot the wanderer looked at the man servant all bright and glittering and at the magnificent castle all bright and glittering and as he looked his eyes grew big with wonder for woot was not very big and not very old and wanderer though he was this proved the most gorgeous sight that had ever met his boyish gaze  who lives here he asked  the emperor of the winkies who is the famous tin woodman of oz replied the servant who had been trained to treat all strangers with courtesy  a tin woodman how queer exclaimed the little wanderer  well perhaps our emperor is queer admitted the servant but he is a kind master and as honest and true as good tin can make him so we who gladly serve him are apt to forget that he is not like other people  may i see him asked woot the wanderer after a moment's thought  if it please you to wait a moment i will go and ask him said the servant and then he went into the hall where the tin woodman sat with his friend the scarecrow both were glad to learn that a stranger had arrived at the castle for this would give them something new to talk about so the servant was asked to admit the boy at once  by the time woot the wanderer had passed through the grand corridors all lined with ornamental tin and under stately tin archways and through the many tin rooms all set with beautiful tin furniture his eyes had grown bigger than ever and his whole little body thrilled with amazement but astonished though he was he was able to make a polite bow before the throne and to say in a respectful voice  i salute your illustrious majesty and offer you my humble services  very good answered the tin woodman in his accustomed cheerful manner tell me who you are and whence you come  i am known as woot the wanderer answered the boy and i have come through many travels and by roundabout ways from my former home in a far corner of the gillikin country of oz  to wander from one's home remarked the scarecrow is to encounter dangers and hardships especially if one is made of meat and bone had you no friends in that corner of the gillikin country was it not homelike and comfortable  to hear a man stuffed with straw speak and speak so well quite startled woot and perhaps he stared a bit rudely at the scarecrow but after a moment he replied   i had home and friends your honorable strawness but they were so quiet and happy and comfortable that i found them dismally stupid nothing in that corner of oz interested me but i believed that in other parts of the country i would find strange people and see new sights and so i set out upon my wandering journey i have been a wanderer for nearly a full year and now my wanderings have brought me to this splendid castle  i suppose said the tin woodman that in this year you have seen so much that you have become very wise  no replied woot thoughtfully i am not at all wise i beg to assure your majesty the more i wander the less i find that i know for in the land of oz much wisdom and many things may be learned  to learn is simple don't you ask questions inquired the scarecrow  yes i ask as many questions as i dare but some people refuse to answer questions  that is not kind of them declared the tin woodman if one does not ask for information he seldom receives it so i for my part make it a rule to answer any civil question that is asked me  so do i added the scarecrow nodding  i am glad to hear this said the wanderer for it makes me bold to ask for something to eat    bless the boy cried the emperor of the winkies how careless of me not to remember that wanderers are usually hungry i will have food brought you at once  saying this he blew upon a tin whistle that was suspended from his tin neck and at the summons a servant appeared and bowed low the tin woodman ordered food for the stranger and in a few minutes the servant brought in a tin tray heaped with a choice array of good things to eat all neatly displayed on tin dishes that were polished till they shone like mirrors the tray was set upon a tin table drawn before the throne and the servant placed a tin chair before the table for the boy to seat himself  eat friend wanderer said the emperor cordially and i trust the feast will be to your liking i myself do not eat being made in such manner that i require no food to keep me alive neither does my friend the scarecrow but all my winkie people eat being formed of flesh as you are and so my tin cupboard is never bare and strangers are always welcome to whatever it contains  the boy ate in silence for a time being really hungry but after his appetite was somewhat satisfied he said   how happened your majesty to be made of tin and still be alive  that replied the tin man is a long story    the longer the better said the boy won't you please tell me the story  if you desire it promised the tin woodman leaning back in his tin throne and crossing his tin legs i haven't related my history in a long while because everyone here knows it nearly as well as i do but you being a stranger are no doubt curious to learn how i became so beautiful and prosperous so i will recite for your benefit my strange adventures  thank you said woot the wanderer still eating  i was not always made of tin began the emperor for in the beginning i was a man of flesh and bone and blood and lived in the munchkin country of oz there i was by trade a woodchopper and contributed my share to the comfort of the oz people by chopping up the trees of the forest to make firewood with which the women would cook their meals while the children warmed themselves about the fires for my home i had a little hut by the edge of the forest and my life was one of much content until i fell in love with a beautiful munchkin girl who lived not far away  what was the munchkin girl's name asked woot  nimmie amee this girl so fair that the sunsets blushed when their rays fell upon her lived with a powerful witch who wore silver shoes and who had made the poor child her slave nimmie amee was obliged to work from morning till night for the old witch of the east scrubbing and sweeping her hut and cooking her meals and washing her dishes she had to cut firewood too until i found her one day in the forest and fell in love with her after that i always brought plenty of firewood to nimmie amee and we became very friendly finally i asked her to marry me and she agreed to do so but the witch happened to overhear our conversation and it made her very angry for she did not wish her slave to be taken away from her the witch commanded me never to come near nimmie amee again but i told her i was my own master and would do as i pleased not realizing that this was a careless way to speak to a witch  the next day as i was cutting wood in the forest the cruel witch enchanted my axe so that it slipped and cut off my right leg  how dreadful cried woot the wanderer  yes it was a seeming misfortune agreed the tin man for a one-legged woodchopper is of little use in his trade but i would not allow the witch to conquer me so easily i knew a very skillful mechanic at the other side of the forest who was my friend so i hopped on one leg to him and asked him to help me he soon made me a new leg out of tin and fastened it cleverly to my meat body it had joints at the knee and at the ankle and was almost as comfortable as the leg i had lost  your friend must have been a wonderful workman exclaimed woot  he was indeed admitted the emperor he was a tinsmith by trade and could make anything out of tin when i returned to nimmie amee the girl was delighted and threw her arms around my neck and kissed me declaring she was proud of me the witch saw the kiss and was more angry than before when i went to work in the forest next day my axe being still enchanted slipped and cut off my other leg again i hopped on my tin leg to my friend the tinsmith who kindly made me another tin leg and fastened it to my body so i returned joyfully to nimmie amee who was much pleased with my glittering legs and promised that when we were wed she would always keep them oiled and polished but the witch was more furious than ever and as soon as i raised my axe to chop it twisted around and cut off one of my arms the tinsmith made me a tin arm and i was not much worried because nimmie amee declared she still loved me       the heart of the tin woodman    chapter 2   the emperor of the winkies paused in his story to reach for an oil-can with which he carefully oiled the joints in his tin throat for his voice had begun to squeak a little woot the wanderer having satisfied his hunger watched this oiling process with much curiosity but begged the tin man to go on with his tale  the witch with the silver shoes hated me for having defied her resumed the emperor his voice now sounding clear as a bell and she insisted that nimmie amee should never marry me therefore she made the enchanted axe cut off my other arm and the tinsmith also replaced that member with tin including these finely-jointed hands that you see me using but alas after that the axe still enchanted by the cruel witch cut my body in two so that i fell to the ground then the witch who was watching from a near-by bush rushed up and seized the axe and chopped my body into several small pieces after which thinking that at last she had destroyed me she ran away laughing in wicked glee  but nimmie amee found me she picked up my arms and legs and head and made a bundle of them and carried them to the tinsmith who set to work and made me a fine body of pure tin when he had joined the arms and legs to the body and set my head in the tin collar i was a much better man than ever for my body could not ache or pain me and i was so beautiful and bright that i had no need of clothing clothing is always a nuisance because it soils and tears and has to be replaced but my tin body only needs to be oiled and polished    nimmie amee still declared she would marry me as she still loved me in spite of the witch's evil deeds the girl declared i would make the brightest husband in all the world which was quite true however the wicked witch was not yet defeated when i returned to my work the axe slipped and cut off my head which was the only meat part of me then remaining moreover the old woman grabbed up my severed head and carried it away with her and hid it but nimmie amee came into the forest and found me wandering around helplessly because i could not see where to go and she led me to my friend the tinsmith the faithful fellow at once set to work to make me a tin head and he had just completed it when nimmie amee came running up with my old head which she had stolen from the witch but on reflection i considered the tin head far superior to the meat one i am wearing it yet so you can see its beauty and grace of outline and the girl agreed with me that a man all made of tin was far more perfect than one formed of different materials the tinsmith was as proud of his workmanship as i was and for three whole days all admired me and praised my beauty  being now completely formed of tin i had no more fear of the wicked witch for she was powerless to injure me nimmie amee said we must be married at once for then she could come to my cottage and live with me and keep me bright and sparkling  'i am sure my dear nick' said the brave and beautiful girl my name was then nick chopper you should be told 'that you will make the best husband any girl could have i shall not be obliged to cook for you for now you do not eat i shall not have to make your bed for tin does not tire or require sleep when we go to a dance you will not get weary before the music stops and say you want to go home all day long while you are chopping wood in the forest i shall be able to amuse myself in my own way a privilege few wives enjoy there is no temper in your new head so you will not get angry with me finally i shall take pride in being the wife of the only live tin woodman in all the world' which shows that nimmie amee was as wise as she was brave and beautiful  i think she was a very nice girl said woot the wanderer but tell me please why were you not killed when you were chopped to pieces  in the land of oz replied the emperor no one can ever be killed a man with a wooden leg or a tin leg is still the same man and as i lost parts of my meat body by degrees i always remained the same person as in the beginning even though in the end i was all tin and no meat  i see said the boy thoughtfully and did you marry nimmie amee  no answered the tin woodman i did not she said she still loved me but i found that i no longer loved her my tin body contained no heart and without a heart no one can love so the wicked witch conquered in the end and when i left the munchkin country of oz the poor girl was still the slave of the witch and had to do her bidding day and night  where did you go asked woot  well i first started out to find a heart so i could love nimmie amee again but hearts are more scarce than one would think one day in a big forest that was strange to me my joints suddenly became rusted because i had forgotten to oil them there i stood unable to move hand or foot and there i continued to stand while days came and went until dorothy and the scarecrow came along and rescued me they oiled my joints and set me free and i've taken good care never to rust again  who was this dorothy questioned the wanderer  a little girl who happened to be in a house when it was carried by a cyclone all the way from kansas to the land of oz when the house fell in the munchkin country it fortunately landed on the wicked witch and smashed her flat it was a big house and i think the witch is under it yet  no said the scarecrow correcting him dorothy says the witch turned to dust and the wind scattered the dust in every direction  well continued the tin woodman after meeting the scarecrow and dorothy i went with them to the emerald city where the wizard of oz gave me a heart but the wizard's stock of hearts was low and he gave me a kind heart instead of a loving heart so that i could not love nimmie amee any more than i did when i was heartless  couldn't the wizard give you a heart that was both kind and loving asked the boy  no that was what i asked for but he said he was so short on hearts just then that there was but one in stock and i could take that or none at all so i accepted it and i must say that for its kind it is a very good heart indeed  it seems to me said woot musingly that the wizard fooled you it can't be a very kind heart you know  why not demanded the emperor  because it was unkind of you to desert the girl who loved you and who had been faithful and true to you when you were in trouble had the heart the wizard gave you been a kind heart you would have gone back home and made the beautiful munchkin girl your wife and then brought her here to be an empress and live in your splendid tin castle  the tin woodman was so surprised at this frank speech that for a time he did nothing but stare hard at the boy wanderer but the scarecrow wagged his stuffed head and said in a positive tone   this boy is right i've often wondered myself why you didn't go back and find that poor munchkin girl  then the tin woodman stared hard at his friend the scarecrow but finally he said in a serious tone of voice   i must admit that never before have i thought of such a thing as finding nimmie amee and making her empress of the winkies but it is surely not too late even now to do this for the girl must still be living in the munchkin country and since this strange wanderer has reminded me of nimmie amee i believe it is my duty to set out and find her surely it is not the girl's fault that i no longer love her and so if i can make her happy it is proper that i should do so and in this way reward her for her faithfulness    quite right my friend agreed the scarecrow  will you accompany me on this errand asked the tin emperor  of course said the scarecrow  and will you take me along pleaded woot the wanderer in an eager voice  to be sure said the tin woodman if you care to join our party it was you who first told me it was my duty to find and marry nimmie amee and i'd like you to know that nick chopper the tin emperor of the winkies is a man who never shirks his duty once it is pointed out to him  it ought to be a pleasure as well as a duty if the girl is so beautiful said woot well pleased with the idea of the adventure  beautiful things may be admired if not loved asserted the tin man flowers are beautiful for instance but we are not inclined to marry them duty on the contrary is a bugle call to action whether you are inclined to act or not in this case i obey the bugle call of duty  when shall we start inquired the scarecrow who was always glad to embark upon a new adventure i don't hear any bugle but when do we go  as soon as we can get ready answered the emperor i'll call my servants at once and order them to make preparations for our journey     roundabout    chapter 3   woot the wanderer slept that night in the tin castle of the emperor of the winkies and found his tin bed quite comfortable early the next morning he rose and took a walk through the gardens where there were tin fountains and beds of curious tin flowers and where tin birds perched upon the branches of tin trees and sang songs that sounded like the notes of tin whistles all these wonders had been made by the clever winkie tinsmiths who wound the birds up every morning so that they would move about and sing  after breakfast the boy went into the throne room where the emperor was having his tin joints carefully oiled by a servant while other servants were stuffing sweet fresh straw into the body of the scarecrow  woot watched this operation with much interest for the scarecrow's body was only a suit of clothes filled with straw the coat was buttoned tight to keep the packed straw from falling out and a rope was tied around the waist to hold it in shape and prevent the straw from sagging down the scarecrow's head was a gunnysack filled with bran on which the eyes nose and mouth had been painted his hands were white cotton gloves stuffed with fine straw woot noticed that even when carefully stuffed and patted into shape the straw man was awkward in his movements and decidedly wobbly on his feet so the boy wondered if the scarecrow would be able to travel with them all the way to the forests of the munchkin country of oz  the preparations made for this important journey were very simple a knapsack was filled with food and given woot the wanderer to carry upon his back for the food was for his use alone the tin woodman shouldered an axe which was sharp and brightly polished and the scarecrow put the emperor's oil-can in his pocket that he might oil his friend's joints should they need it  [illustration  i don't hear any bugle]  who will govern the winkie country during your absence asked the boy  why the country will run itself answered the emperor as a matter of fact my people do not need an emperor for ozma of oz watches over the welfare of all her subjects including the winkies like a good many kings and emperors i have a grand title but very little real power which allows me time to amuse myself in my own way the people of oz have but one law to obey which is  'behave yourself' so it is easy for them to abide by this law and you'll notice they behave very well but it is time for us to be off and i am eager to start because i suppose that that poor munchkin girl is anxiously awaiting my coming  she's waited a long time already seems to me remarked the scarecrow as they left the grounds of the castle and followed a path that led eastward  true replied the tin woodman but i've noticed that the last end of a wait however long it has been is the hardest to endure so i must try to make nimmie amee happy as soon as possible  ah that proves you have a kind heart remarked the scarecrow approvingly  it's too bad he hasn't a loving heart said woot this tin man is going to marry a nice girl through kindness and not because he loves her and somehow that doesn't seem quite right  even so i am not sure it isn't best for the girl said the scarecrow who seemed very intelligent for a straw man for a loving husband is not always kind while a kind husband is sure to make any girl content  nimmie amee will become an empress announced the tin woodman proudly i shall have a tin gown made for her with tin ruffles and tucks on it and she shall have tin slippers and tin earrings and bracelets and wear a tin crown on her head i am sure that will delight nimmie amee for all girls are fond of finery  are we going to the munchkin country by way of the emerald city inquired the scarecrow who looked upon the tin woodman as the leader of the party  i think not was the reply we are engaged upon a rather delicate adventure for we are seeking a girl who fears her former lover has forgotten her it will be rather hard for me you must admit when i confess to nimmie amee that i have come to marry her because it is my duty to do so and therefore the fewer witnesses there are to our meeting the better for both of us after i have found nimmie amee and she has managed to control her joy at our reunion i shall take her to the emerald city and introduce her to ozma and dorothy and to betsy bobbin and tiny trot and all our other friends but if i remember rightly poor nimmie amee has a sharp tongue when angry and she may be a trifle angry with me at first because i have been so long in coming to her  i can understand that said woot gravely but how can we get to that part of the munchkin country where you once lived without passing through the emerald city  why that is easy the tin man assured him  i have a map of oz in my pocket persisted the boy and it shows that the winkie country where we now are is at the west of oz and the munchkin country at the east while directly between them lies the emerald city  true enough but we shall go toward the north first of all into the gillikin country and so pass around the emerald city explained the tin woodman  that may prove a dangerous journey replied the boy i used to live in one of the top corners of the gillikin country near to oogaboo and i have been told that in this northland country are many people whom it is not pleasant to meet i was very careful to avoid them during my journey south  a wanderer should have no fear observed the scarecrow who was wabbling along in a funny haphazard manner but keeping pace with his friends    fear does not make one a coward returned woot growing a little red in the face but i believe it is more easy to avoid danger than to overcome it the safest way is the best way even for one who is brave and determined  do not worry for we shall not go far to the north said the emperor my one idea is to avoid the emerald city without going out of our way more than is necessary once around the emerald city we will turn south into the munchkin country where the scarecrow and i are well acquainted and have many friends  i have traveled some in the gillikin country remarked the scarecrow and while i must say i have met some strange people there at times i have never yet been harmed by them  well it's all the same to me said woot with assumed carelessness dangers when they cannot be avoided are often quite interesting and i am willing to go wherever you two venture to go  so they left the path they had been following and began to travel toward the northeast and all that day they were in the pleasant winkie country and all the people they met saluted the emperor with great respect and wished him good luck on his journey at night they stopped at a house where they were well entertained and where woot was given a comfortable bed to sleep in  were the scarecrow and i alone said the tin woodman we would travel by night as well as by day but with a meat person in our party we must halt at night to permit him to rest    meat tires after a day's travel added the scarecrow while straw and tin never tire at all which proves said he that we are somewhat superior to people made in the common way  woot could not deny that he was tired and he slept soundly until morning when he was given a good breakfast smoking hot  you two miss a great deal by not eating he said to his companions  it is true responded the scarecrow we miss suffering from hunger when food cannot be had and we miss a stomach-ache now and then  as he said this the scarecrow glanced at the tin woodman who nodded his assent  all that second day they traveled steadily entertaining one another the while with stories of adventures they had formerly met and listening to the scarecrow recite poetry he had learned a great many poems from professor wogglebug and loved to repeat them whenever anybody would listen to him of course woot and the tin woodman now listened because they could not do otherwise unless they rudely ran away from their stuffed comrade  one of the scarecrow's recitations was like this         what sound is so sweet       as the straw from the wheat     when it crunkles so tender and low       it is yellow and bright       so it gives me delight     to crunkle wherever i go        sweet fresh golden straw       there is surely no flaw     in a stuffing so clean and compact       it creaks when i walk       and it thrills when i talk     and its fragrance is fine for a fact        to cut me don't hurt       for i've no blood to squirt     and i therefore can suffer no pain       the straw that i use       doesn't lump up or bruise     though it's pounded again and again        i know it is said       that my beautiful head     has brains of mixed wheat-straw and bran       but my thoughts are so good       i'd not change if i could     for the brains of a common meat man        content with my lot       i'm glad that i'm not     like others i meet day by day       if my insides get musty       or mussed-up or dusty     i get newly stuffed right away       the loons of loonville    chapter 4   toward evening the travelers found there was no longer a path to guide them and the purple hues of the grass and trees warned them that they were now in the country of the gillikins where strange peoples dwelt in places that were quite unknown to the other inhabitants of oz the fields were wild and uncultivated and there were no houses of any sort to be seen but our friends kept on walking even after the sun went down hoping to find a good place for woot the wanderer to sleep but when it grew quite dark and the boy was weary with his long walk they halted right in the middle of a field and allowed woot to get his supper from the food he carried in his knapsack then the scarecrow laid himself down so that woot could use his stuffed body as a pillow and the tin woodman stood up beside them all night so the dampness of the ground might not rust his joints or dull his brilliant polish whenever the dew settled on his body he carefully wiped it off with a cloth and so in the morning the emperor shone as brightly as ever in the rays of the rising sun  they wakened the boy at daybreak the scarecrow saying to him   we have discovered something queer and therefore we must counsel together what to do about it  what have you discovered asked woot rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his knuckles and giving three wide yawns to prove he was fully awake  a sign said the tin woodman a sign and another path  what does the sign say inquired the boy  it says that 'all strangers are warned not to follow this path to loonville' answered the scarecrow who could read very well when his eyes had been freshly painted  [illustration  all strangers are warned not to follow this path to loonville]  in that case said the boy opening his knapsack to get some breakfast let us travel in some other direction  but this did not seem to please either of his companions  i'd like to see what loonville looks like remarked the tin woodman  when one travels it is foolish to miss any interesting sight added the scarecrow  but a warning means danger protested woot the wanderer and i believe it sensible to keep out of danger whenever we can  they made no reply to this speech for a while then said the scarecrow   i have escaped so many dangers during my lifetime that i am not much afraid of anything that can happen  nor am i exclaimed the tin woodman swinging his glittering axe around his tin head in a series of circles few things can injure tin and my axe is a powerful weapon to use against a foe but our boy friend he continued looking solemnly at woot might perhaps be injured if the people of loonville are really dangerous so i propose he waits here while you and i friend scarecrow visit the forbidden city of loonville  don't worry about me advised woot calmly wherever you wish to go i will go and share your dangers during my wanderings i have found it more wise to keep out of danger than to venture in but at that time i was alone and now i have two powerful friends to protect me  so when he had finished his breakfast they all set out along the path that led to loonville  it is a place i have never heard of before remarked the scarecrow as they approached a dense forest the inhabitants may be people of some sort or they may be animals but whatever they prove to be we will have an interesting story to relate to dorothy and ozma on our return  the path led into the forest but the big trees grew so closely together and the vines and underbrush were so thick and matted that they had to clear a path at each step in order to proceed in one or two places the tin man who went first to clear the way cut the branches with a blow of his axe woot followed next and last of the three came the scarecrow who could not have kept the path at all had not his comrades broken the way for his straw-stuffed body  presently the tin woodman pushed his way through some heavy underbrush and almost tumbled headlong into a vast cleared space in the forest the clearing was circular big and roomy yet the top branches of the tall trees reached over and formed a complete dome or roof for it strangely enough it was not dark in this immense natural chamber in the woodland for the place glowed with a soft white light that seemed to come from some unseen source  in the chamber were grouped dozens of queer creatures and these so astonished the tin man that woot had to push his metal body aside that he might see too and the scarecrow pushed woot aside so that the three travelers stood in a row staring with all their eyes  the creatures they beheld were round and ball-like round in body round in legs and arms round in hands and feet and round of head the only exception to the roundness was a slight hollow on the top of each head making it saucer-shaped instead of dome-shaped they wore no clothes on their puffy bodies nor had they any hair their skins were all of a light gray color and their eyes were mere purple spots their noses were as puffy as the rest of them  are they rubber do you think asked the scarecrow who noticed that the creatures bounded as they moved and seemed almost as light as air  it is difficult to tell what they are answered woot they seem to be covered with warts  the loons for so these folks were called had been doing many things some playing together some working at tasks and some gathered in groups to talk but at the sound of strange voices which echoed rather loudly through the clearing all turned in the direction of the intruders then in a body they all rushed forward running and bounding with tremendous speed  the tin woodman was so surprised by this sudden dash that he had no time to raise his axe before the loons were on them the creatures swung their puffy hands which looked like boxing-gloves and pounded the three travelers as hard as they could on all sides the blows were quite soft and did not hurt our friends at all but the onslaught quite bewildered them so that in a brief period all three were knocked over and fell flat upon the ground once down many of the loons held them to prevent their getting up again while others wound long tendrils of vines about them binding their arms and legs to their bodies and so rendering them helpless  aha cried the biggest loon of all we've got 'em safe so let's carry 'em to king bal and have 'em tried and condemned and perforated  they had to drag their captives to the center of the domed chamber for their weight as compared with that of the loons prevented their being carried even the scarecrow was much heavier than the puffy loons but finally the party halted before a raised platform on which stood a sort of throne consisting of a big wide chair with a string tied to one arm of it this string led upward to the roof of the dome  arranged before the platform the prisoners were allowed to sit up facing the empty throne  good said the big loon who had commanded the party now to get king bal to judge these terrible creatures we have so bravely captured  as he spoke he took hold of the string and began to pull as hard as he could one or two of the others helped him and pretty soon as they drew in the cord the leaves above them parted and a loon appeared at the other end of the string it didn't take long to draw him down to the throne where he seated himself and was tied in so he wouldn't float upward again  hello said the king blinking his purple eyes at his followers what's up now  strangers your majesty strangers and captives replied the big loon pompously  dear me i see 'em i see 'em very plainly exclaimed the king his purple eyes bulging out as he looked at the three prisoners what curious animals are they dangerous do you think my good panta  i'm 'fraid so your majesty of course they may not be dangerous but we mustn't take chances enough accidents happen to us poor loons as it is and my advice is to condemn and perforate 'em as quickly as possible  keep your advice to yourself said the monarch in a peeved tone who's king here anyhow you or me  we made you our king because you have less common sense than the rest of us answered panta loon indignantly i could have been king myself had i wanted to but i didn't care for the hard work and responsibility  as he said this the big loon strutted back and forth in the space between the throne of king bal and the prisoners and the other loons seemed much impressed by his defiance but suddenly there came a sharp report and panta loon instantly disappeared to the great astonishment of the scarecrow the tin woodman and woot the wanderer who saw on the spot where the big fellow had stood a little heap of flabby wrinkled skin that looked like a collapsed rubber balloon  there exclaimed the king i expected that would happen the conceited rascal wanted to puff himself up until he was bigger than the rest of you and this is the result of his folly get the pump working some of you and blow him up again  we will have to mend the puncture first your majesty suggested one of the loons and the prisoners noticed that none of them seemed surprised or shocked at the sad accident to panta  all right grumbled the king fetch til to mend him  one or two ran away and presently returned followed by a lady loon wearing huge puffed-up rubber skirts also she had a purple feather fastened to a wart on the top of her head and around her waist was a sash of fibre-like vines dried and tough that looked like strings  get to work til commanded king bal panta has just exploded  the lady loon picked up the bunch of skin and examined it carefully until she discovered a hole in one foot then she pulled a strand of string from her sash and drawing the edges of the hole together she tied them fast with the string thus making one of those curious warts which the strangers had noticed on so many loons having done this til loon tossed the bit of skin to the other loons and was about to go away when she noticed the prisoners and stopped to inspect them  dear me said til what dreadful creatures where did they come from  we captured them replied one of the loons  and what are we going to do with them inquired the girl loon  perhaps we'll condemn 'em and puncture 'em answered the king  well said she still eyeing the captives i'm not sure they'll puncture let's try it and see  one of the loons ran to the forest's edge and quickly returned with a long sharp thorn he glanced at the king who nodded his head in assent and then he rushed forward and stuck the thorn into the leg of the scarecrow the scarecrow merely smiled and said nothing for the thorn didn't hurt him at all  then the loon tried to prick the tin woodman's leg but the tin only blunted the point of the thorn    just as i thought said til blinking her purple eyes and shaking her puffy head but just then the loon stuck the thorn into the leg of woot the wanderer and while it had been blunted somewhat it was still sharp enough to hurt  ouch yelled woot and kicked out his leg with so much energy that the frail bonds that tied him burst apart his foot caught the loon who was leaning over him full on his puffy stomach and sent him shooting up into the air when he was high over their heads he exploded with a loud pop and his skin fell to the ground  i really believe said the king rolling his spot-like eyes in a frightened way that panta was right in claiming these prisoners are dangerous is the pump ready  some of the loons had wheeled a big machine in front of the throne and now took panta's skin and began to pump air into it slowly it swelled out until the king cried stop  no no yelled panta i'm not big enough yet  you're as big as you're going to be declared the king before you exploded you were bigger than the rest of us and that caused you to be proud and overbearing now you're a little smaller than the rest and you will last longer and be more humble  pump me up pump me up wailed panta if you don't you'll break my heart  if we do we'll break your skin replied the king  so the loons stopped pumping air into panta and pushed him away from the pump he was certainly more humble than before his accident for he crept into the background and said nothing more    now pump up the other one ordered the king til had already mended him and the loons set to work to pump him full of air  during these last few moments none had paid much attention to the prisoners so woot finding his legs free crept over to the tin woodman and rubbed the bonds that were still around his arms and body against the sharp edge of the axe which quickly cut them  the boy was now free and the thorn which the loon had stuck into his leg was lying unnoticed on the ground where the creature had dropped it when he exploded woot leaned forward and picked up the thorn and while the loons were busy watching the pump the boy sprang to his feet and suddenly rushed upon the group  pop pop pop went three of the loons when the wanderer pricked them with his thorn and at the sounds the others looked around and saw their danger with yells of fear they bounded away in all directions scattering about the clearing with woot the wanderer in full chase while they could run much faster than the boy they often stumbled and fell or got in one another's way so he managed to catch several and prick them with his thorn  it astonished him to see how easily the loons exploded when the air was let out of them they were quite helpless til loon was one of those who ran against his thorn and many others suffered the same fate the creatures could not escape from the enclosure but in their fright many bounded upward and caught branches of the trees and then climbed out of reach of the dreaded thorn  woot was getting pretty tired chasing them so he stopped and came over panting to where his friends were sitting still bound  very well done my wanderer said the tin woodman it is evident that we need fear these puffed-up creatures no longer so be kind enough to unfasten our bonds and we will proceed upon our journey  woot untied the bonds of the scarecrow and helped him to his feet then he freed the tin woodman who got up without help looking around them they saw that the only loon now remaining within reach was bal loon the king who had remained seated in his throne watching the punishment of his people with a bewildered look in his purple eyes  shall i puncture the king the boy asked his companions    king bal must have overheard the question for he fumbled with the cord that fastened him to the throne and managed to release it then he floated upward until he reached the leafy dome and parting the branches he disappeared from sight but the string that was tied to his body was still connected with the arm of the throne and they knew they could pull his majesty down again if they wanted to  let him alone suggested the scarecrow he seems a good enough king for his peculiar people and after we are gone the loons will have something of a job to pump up all those whom woot has punctured  every one of them ought to be exploded declared woot who was angry because his leg still hurt him  no said the tin woodman that would not be just fair they were quite right to capture us because we had no business to intrude here having been warned to keep away from loonville this is their country not ours and since the poor things can't get out of the clearing they can harm no one save those who venture here out of curiosity as we did  well said my friend agreed the scarecrow we really had no right to disturb their peace and comfort so let us go away  they easily found the place where they had forced their way into the enclosure so the tin woodman pushed aside the underbrush and started first along the path the scarecrow followed next and last came woot who looked back and saw that the loons were still clinging to their perches on the trees and watching their former captives with frightened eyes  i guess they're glad to see the last of us remarked the boy and laughing at the happy ending of the adventure he followed his comrades along the path       mrs yoop the giantess    chapter 5   when they had reached the end of the path where they had first seen the warning sign they set off across the country in an easterly direction before long they reached rolling lands which were a succession of hills and valleys where constant climbs and descents were required and their journey now became tedious because on climbing each hill they found before them nothing in the valley below it except grass or weeds or stones  up and down they went for hours with nothing to relieve the monotony of the landscape until finally when they had topped a higher hill than usual they discovered a cup-shaped valley before them in the center of which stood an enormous castle built of purple stone the castle was high and broad and long but had no turrets and towers so far as they could see there was but one small window and one big door on each side of the great building  this is strange mused the scarecrow i'd no idea such a big castle existed in this gillikin country i wonder who lives here  it seems to me from this distance remarked the tin woodman that it's the biggest castle i ever saw it is really too big for any use and no one could open or shut those big doors without a stepladder  perhaps if we go nearer we shall find out whether anybody lives there or not suggested woot looks to me as if nobody lived there  on they went and when they reached the center of the valley where the great stone castle stood it was beginning to grow dark so they hesitated as to what to do  if friendly people happen to live here said woot i shall be glad of a bed but should enemies occupy the place i prefer to sleep upon the ground  and if no one at all lives here added the scarecrow we can enter and take possession and make ourselves at home  while speaking he went nearer to one of the great doors which was three times as high and broad as any he had ever seen in a house before and then he discovered engraved in big letters upon a stone over the doorway the words   yoop castle  oho he exclaimed i know the place now this was probably the home of mr yoop a terrible giant whom i have seen confined in a cage a long way from here therefore this castle is likely to be empty and we may use it in any way we please  yes yes said the tin emperor nodding i also remember mr yoop but how are we to get into his deserted castle the latch of the door is so far above our heads that none of us can reach it  they considered this problem for a while and then woot said to the tin man     if i stand upon your shoulders i think i can unlatch the door  climb up then was the reply and when the boy was perched upon the tin shoulders of nick chopper he was just able to reach the latch and raise it  at once the door swung open its great hinges making a groaning sound as if in protest so woot leaped down and followed his companions into a big bare hallway scarcely were the three inside however when they heard the door slam shut behind them and this astonished them because no one had touched it it had closed of its own accord as if by magic moreover the latch was on the outside and the thought occurred to each one of them that they were now prisoners in this unknown castle  however mumbled the scarecrow we are not to blame for what cannot be helped so let us push bravely ahead and see what may be seen  it was quite dark in the hallway now that the outside door was shut so as they stumbled along a stone passage they kept close together not knowing what danger was likely to befall them  suddenly a soft glow enveloped them it grew brighter until they could see their surroundings distinctly they had reached the end of the passage and before them was another huge door this noiselessly swung open before them without the help of anyone and through the doorway they observed a big chamber the walls of which were lined with plates of pure gold highly polished  this room was also lighted although they could discover no lamps and in the center of it was a great table at which sat an immense woman she was clad in silver robes embroidered with gay floral designs and wore over this splendid raiment a short apron of elaborate lace-work such an apron was no protection and was not in keeping with the handsome gown but the huge woman wore it nevertheless the table at which she sat was spread with a white cloth and had golden dishes upon it so the travelers saw that they had surprised the giantess while she was eating her supper  she had her back toward them and did not even turn around but taking a biscuit from a dish she began to butter it and said in a voice that was big and deep but not especially unpleasant   why don't you come in and allow the door to shut you're causing a draught and i shall catch cold and sneeze when i sneeze i get cross and when i get cross i'm liable to do something wicked come in you foolish strangers come in  being thus urged they entered the room and approached the table until they stood where they faced the great giantess she continued eating but smiled in a curious way as she looked at them woot noticed that the door had closed silently after they had entered and that didn't please him at all  well said the giantess what excuse have you to offer  we didn't know anyone lived here madam explained the scarecrow so being travelers and strangers in these parts and wishing to find a place for our boy friend to sleep we ventured to enter your castle  you knew it was private property i suppose said she buttering another biscuit  we saw the words 'yoop castle' over the door but we knew that mr yoop is a prisoner in a cage in a far-off part of the land of oz so we decided there was no one now at home and that we might use the castle for the night  i see remarked the giantess nodding her head and smiling again in that curious way a way that made woot shudder you didn't know that mr yoop was married or that after he was cruelly captured his wife still lived in his castle and ran it to suit herself  who captured mr yoop asked woot looking gravely at the big woman  wicked enemies people who selfishly objected to yoop's taking their cows and sheep for his food i must admit however that yoop had a bad temper and had the habit of knocking over a few houses now and then when he was angry so one day the little folks came in a great crowd and captured mr yoop and carried him away to a cage somewhere in the mountains i don't know where it is and i don't care for my husband treated me badly at times forgetting the respect a giant owes to a giantess often he kicked me on my shins when i wouldn't wait on him so i'm glad he is gone  it's a wonder the people didn't capture you too remarked woot  well i was too clever for them said she giving a sudden laugh that caused such a breeze that the wobbly scarecrow was almost blown off his feet and had to grab his friend nick chopper to steady himself i saw the people coming continued mrs yoop and knowing they meant mischief i transformed myself into a mouse and hid in a cupboard after they had gone away carrying my shin-kicking husband with them i transformed myself back to my former shape again and here i've lived in peace and comfort ever since  are you a witch then inquired woot  well not exactly a witch she replied but i'm an artist in transformations in other words i'm more of a yookoohoo than a witch and of course you know that the yookoohoos are the cleverest magic-workers in the world  the travelers were silent for a time uneasily considering this statement and the effect it might have on their future no doubt the giantess had wilfully made them her prisoners yet she spoke so cheerfully in her big voice that until now they had not been alarmed in the least  by and by the scarecrow whose mixed brains had been working steadily asked the woman   are we to consider you our friend mrs yoop or do you intend to be our enemy  i never have friends she said in a matter-of-fact tone because friends get too familiar and always forget to mind their own business but i am not your enemy not yet anyhow indeed i'm glad you've come for my life here is rather lonely i've had no one to talk to since i transformed polychrome the daughter of the rainbow into a canary-bird  how did you manage to do that asked the tin woodman in amazement polychrome is a powerful fairy  she was said the giantess but now she's a canary-bird one day after a rain polychrome danced off the rainbow and fell asleep on a little mound in this valley not far from my castle the sun came out and drove the rainbow away and before poly wakened i stole out and transformed her into a canary-bird in a gold cage studded with diamonds the cage was so she couldn't fly away i expected she'd sing and talk and we'd have good times together but she has proved no company for me at all ever since the moment of her transformation she has refused to speak a single word  where is she now inquired woot who had heard tales of lovely polychrome and was much interested in her  the cage is hanging up in my bedroom said the giantess eating another biscuit  the travelers were now more uneasy and suspicious of the giantess than before if polychrome the rainbow's daughter who was a real fairy had been transformed and enslaved by this huge woman who claimed to be a yookoohoo what was liable to happen to them said the scarecrow twisting his stuffed head around in mrs yoop's direction   do you know ma'am who we are  of course said she a straw man a tin man and a boy  we are very important people declared the tin woodman  all the better she replied i shall enjoy your society the more on that account for i mean to keep you here as long as i live to amuse me when i get lonely and she added slowly in this valley no one ever dies  they didn't like this speech at all so the scarecrow frowned in a way that made mrs yoop smile while the tin woodman looked so fierce that mrs yoop laughed the scarecrow suspected she was going to laugh so he slipped behind his friends to escape the wind from her breath from this safe position he said warningly   we have powerful friends who will soon come to rescue us    let them come she returned with an accent of scorn when they get here they will find neither a boy nor a tin man nor a scarecrow for tomorrow morning i intend to transform you all into other shapes so that you cannot be recognized  this threat filled them with dismay the good-natured giantess was more terrible than they had imagined she could smile and wear pretty clothes and at the same time be even more cruel than her wicked husband had been  both the scarecrow and the tin woodman tried to think of some way to escape from the castle before morning but she seemed to read their thoughts and shook her head  don't worry your poor brains said she you can't escape me however hard you try but why should you wish to escape i shall give you new forms that are much better than the ones you now have be contented with your fate for discontent leads to unhappiness and unhappiness in any form is the greatest evil that can befall you  what forms do you intend to give us asked woot earnestly  i haven't decided as yet i'll dream over it tonight so in the morning i shall have made up my mind how to transform you perhaps you'd prefer to choose your own transformations  no said woot i prefer to remain as i am  that's funny she retorted you are little and you're weak as you are you're not much account anyhow the best thing about you is that you're alive for i shall be able to make of you some sort of live creature which will be a great improvement on your present form    she took another biscuit from a plate and dipped it in a pot of honey and calmly began eating it  the scarecrow watched her thoughtfully  there are no fields of grain in your valley said he where then did you get the flour to make your biscuits  mercy me do you think i'd bother to make biscuits out of flour she replied that is altogether too tedious a process for a yookoohoo i set some traps this afternoon and caught a lot of field-mice but as i do not like to eat mice i transformed them into hot biscuits for my supper the honey in this pot was once a wasp's nest but since being transformed it has become sweet and delicious all i need do when i wish to eat is to take something i don't care to keep and transform it into any sort of food i like and eat it are you hungry  i don't eat thank you said the scarecrow  nor do i said the tin woodman  i have still a little natural food in my knapsack said woot the wanderer and i'd rather eat that than any wasp's nest  every one to his taste said the giantess carelessly and having now finished her supper she rose to her feet clapped her hands together and the supper table at once disappeared     the magic of a yookoohoo    chapter 6   woot had seen very little of magic during his wanderings while the scarecrow and the tin woodman had seen a great deal of many sorts in their lives yet all three were greatly impressed by mrs yoop's powers she did not affect any mysterious airs or indulge in chants or mystic rites as most witches do nor was the giantess old and ugly or disagreeable in face or manner nevertheless she frightened her prisoners more than any witch could have done  please be seated she said to them as she sat herself down in a great arm-chair and spread her beautiful embroidered skirts for them to admire but all the chairs in the room were so high that our friends could not climb to the seats of them mrs yoop observed this and waved her hand when instantly a golden ladder appeared leaning against a chair opposite her own  climb up said she and they obeyed the tin man and the boy assisting the more clumsy scarecrow when they were all seated in a row on the cushion of the chair the giantess continued  now tell me how you happened to travel in this direction and where you came from and what your errand is  so the tin woodman told her all about nimmie amee and how he had decided to find her and marry her although he had no loving heart the story seemed to amuse the big woman who then began to ask the scarecrow questions and for the first time in her life heard of ozma of oz and of dorothy and jack pumpkinhead and dr pipt and tik-tok and many other oz people who are well known in the emerald city also woot had to tell his story which was very simple and did not take long the giantess laughed heartily when the boy related their adventure at loonville but said she knew nothing of the loons because she never left her valley  there are wicked people who would like to capture me as they did my giant husband mr yoop said she so i stay at home and mind my own business  if ozma knew that you dared to work magic without her consent she would punish you severely declared the scarecrow for this castle is in the land of oz and no persons in the land of oz are permitted to work magic except glinda the good and the little wizard who lives with ozma in the emerald city  that for your ozma exclaimed the giantess snapping her fingers in derision what do i care for a girl whom i have never seen and who has never seen me  but ozma is a fairy said the tin woodman and therefore she is very powerful also we are under ozma's protection and to injure us in any way would make her extremely angry  what i do here in my own private castle in this secluded valley where no one comes but fools like you can never be known to your fairy ozma returned the giantess do not seek to frighten me from my purpose and do not allow yourselves to be frightened for it is best to meet bravely what cannot be avoided i am now going to bed and in the morning i will give you all new forms such as will be more interesting to me than the ones you now wear good night and pleasant dreams  saying this mrs yoop rose from her chair and walked through a doorway into another room so heavy was the tread of the giantess that even the walls of the big stone castle trembled as she stepped she closed the door of her bedroom behind her and then suddenly the light went out and the three prisoners found themselves in total darkness  the tin woodman and the scarecrow didn't mind the dark at all but woot the wanderer felt worried to be left in this strange place in this strange manner without being able to see any danger that might threaten  the big woman might have given me a bed anyhow he said to his companions and scarcely had he spoken when he felt something press against his legs which were then dangling from the seat of the chair leaning down he put out his hand and found that a bedstead had appeared with mattress sheets and covers all complete he lost no time in slipping down upon the bed and was soon fast asleep  during the night the scarecrow and the emperor talked in low tones together and they got out of the chair and moved all about the room feeling for some hidden spring that might open a door or window and permit them to escape  morning found them still unsuccessful in the quest and as soon as it was daylight woot's bed suddenly disappeared and he dropped to the floor with a thump that quickly wakened him and after a time the giantess came from her bedroom wearing another dress that was quite as elaborate as the one in which she had been attired the evening before and also wearing the pretty lace apron having seated herself in a chair she said   i'm hungry so i'll have breakfast at once  she clapped her hands together and instantly the table appeared before her spread with snowy linen and laden with golden dishes but there was no food upon the table nor anything else except a pitcher of water a bundle of weeds and a handful of pebbles but the giantess poured some water into her coffee-pot patted it once or twice with her hand and then poured out a cupful of steaming hot coffee  would you like some she asked woot  he was suspicious of magic coffee but it smelled so good that he could not resist it so he answered  if you please madam  the giantess poured out another cup and set it on the floor for woot it was as big as a tub and the golden spoon in the saucer beside the cup was so heavy the boy could scarcely lift it but woot managed to get a sip of the coffee and found it delicious  mrs yoop next transformed the weeds into a dish of oatmeal which she ate with good appetite  now then said she picking up the pebbles i'm wondering whether i shall have fish-balls or lamb-chops to complete my meal which would you prefer woot the wanderer  if you please i'll eat the food in my knapsack answered the boy your magic food might taste good but i'm afraid of it  the woman laughed at his fears and transformed the pebbles into fish-balls    i suppose you think that after you had eaten this food it would turn to stones again and make you sick she remarked but that would be impossible nothing i transform ever gets back to its former shape again so these fish-balls can never more be pebbles that is why i have to be careful of my transformations she added busily eating while she talked for while i can change forms at will i can never change them back again which proves that even the powers of a clever yookoohoo are limited when i have transformed you three people you must always wear the shapes that i have given you  then please don't transform us begged woot for we are quite satisfied to remain as we are  i am not expecting to satisfy you but intend to please myself she declared and my pleasure is to give you new shapes for if by chance your friends came in search of you not one of them would be able to recognize you  her tone was so positive that they knew it would be useless to protest the woman was not unpleasant to look at her face was not cruel her voice was big but gracious in tone but her words showed that she possessed a merciless heart and no pleadings would alter her wicked purpose  mrs yoop took ample time to finish her breakfast and the prisoners had no desire to hurry her but finally the meal was concluded and she folded her napkin and made the table disappear by clapping her hands together then she turned to her captives and said   the next thing on the programme is to change your forms  have you decided what forms to give us asked the scarecrow uneasily  yes i dreamed it all out while i was asleep this tin man seems a very solemn person indeed the tin woodman was looking solemn just then for he was greatly disturbed so i shall change him into an owl  all she did was to point one finger at him as she spoke but immediately the form of the tin woodman began to change and in a few seconds nick chopper the emperor of the winkies had been transformed into an owl with eyes as big as saucers and a hooked beak and strong claws but he was still tin he was a tin owl with tin legs and beak and eyes and feathers when he flew to the back of a chair and perched upon it his tin feathers rattled against one another with a tinny clatter  the giantess seemed much amused by the tin owl's appearance for her laugh was big and jolly  you're not liable to get lost said she for your wings and feathers will make a racket wherever you go and on my word a tin owl is so rare and pretty that it is an improvement on the ordinary bird i did not intend to make you tin but i forgot to wish you to be meat however tin you were and tin you are and as it's too late to change you that settles it  until now the scarecrow had rather doubted the possibility of mrs yoop's being able to transform him or his friend the tin woodman for they were not made as ordinary people are he had worried more over what might happen to woot than to himself but now he began to worry about himself  madam he said hastily i consider this action very impolite it may even be called rude considering we are your guests  you are not guests for i did not invite you here she replied  perhaps not but we craved hospitality we threw ourselves upon your mercy so to speak and we now find you have no mercy therefore if you will excuse the expression i must say it is downright wicked to take our proper forms away from us and give us others that we do not care for  are you trying to make me angry she asked frowning  by no means said the scarecrow i'm just trying to make you act more ladylike    oh indeed in my opinion mr scarecrow you are now acting like a bear so a bear you shall be  again the dreadful finger pointed this time in the scarecrow's direction and at once his form began to change in a few seconds he had become a small brown bear but he was stuffed with straw as he had been before and when the little brown bear shuffled across the floor he was just as wobbly as the scarecrow had been and moved just as awkwardly  woot was amazed but he was also thoroughly frightened  did it hurt he asked the little brown bear  no of course not growled the scarecrow in the bear's form but i don't like walking on four legs it's undignified  consider my humiliation chirped the tin owl trying to settle its tin feathers smoothly with its tin beak and i can't see very well either the light seems to hurt my eyes  that's because you are an owl said woot i think you will see better in the dark  well remarked the giantess i'm very well pleased with these new forms for my part and i'm sure you will like them better when you get used to them so now she added turning to the boy it is your turn  don't you think you'd better leave me as i am asked woot in a trembling voice  no she replied i'm going to make a monkey of you i love monkeys they're so cute and i think a green monkey will be lots of fun and amuse me when i am sad  woot shivered for again the terrible magic finger pointed and pointed directly his way he felt himself changing not so very much however and it didn't hurt him a bit he looked down at his limbs and body and found that his clothes were gone and his skin covered with a fine silk-like green fur his hands and feet were now those of a monkey he realized he really was a monkey and his first feeling was one of anger he began to chatter as monkeys do he bounded to the seat of a giant chair and then to its back and with a wild leap sprang upon the laughing giantess his idea was to seize her hair and pull it out by the roots and so have revenge for her wicked transformations but she raised her hand and said   gently my dear monkey gently you're not angry you're happy as can be  woot stopped short no he wasn't a bit angry now he felt as good-humored and gay as ever he did when a boy instead of pulling mrs yoop's hair he perched on her shoulder and smoothed her soft cheek with his hairy paw in return she smiled at the funny green animal and patted his head  very good said the giantess let us all become friends and be happy together how is my tin owl feeling  quite comfortable said the owl i don't like it to be sure but i'm not going to allow my new form to make me unhappy but tell me please  what is a tin owl good for  you are only good to make me laugh replied the giantess  will a stuffed bear also make you laugh inquired the scarecrow sitting back on his haunches to look up at her  of course declared the giantess and i have added a little magic to your transformations to make you all contented with wearing your new forms i'm sorry i didn't think to do that when i transformed polychrome into a canary-bird but perhaps when she sees how cheerful you are she will cease to be silent and sullen and take to singing i will go get the bird and let you see her  with this mrs yoop went into the next room and soon returned bearing a golden cage in which sat upon a swinging perch a lovely yellow canary    polychrome said the giantess permit me to introduce to you a green monkey which used to be a boy called woot the wanderer and a tin owl which used to be a tin woodman named nick chopper and a straw-stuffed little brown bear which used to be a live scarecrow  we already know one another declared the scarecrow the bird is polychrome the rainbow's daughter and she and i used to be good friends  are you really my old friend the scarecrow asked the bird in a sweet low voice  there cried mrs yoop that's the first time she has spoken since she was transformed  i am really your old friend answered the scarecrow but you must pardon me for appearing just now in this brutal form  i am a bird as you are dear poly said the tin woodman but alas a tin owl is not as beautiful as a canary-bird  how dreadful it all is sighed the canary couldn't you manage to escape from this terrible yookoohoo  no answered the scarecrow we tried to escape but failed she first made us her prisoners and then transformed us but how did she manage to get you polychrome  i was asleep and she took unfair advantage of me answered the bird sadly had i been awake i could easily have protected myself  tell me said the green monkey earnestly as he came close to the cage what must we do daughter of the rainbow to escape from these transformations can't you help us being a fairy    at present i am powerless to help even myself replied the canary  that's the exact truth exclaimed the giantess who seemed pleased to hear the bird talk even though it complained you are all helpless and in my power so you may as well make up your minds to accept your fate and be content remember that you are transformed for good since no magic on earth can break your enchantments i am now going out for my morning walk for each day after breakfast i walk sixteen times around my castle for exercise amuse yourselves while i am gone and when i return i hope to find you all reconciled and happy  so the giantess walked to the door by which our friends had entered the great hall and spoke one word  open then the door swung open and after mrs yoop had passed out it closed again with a snap as its powerful bolts shot into place the green monkey had rushed toward the opening hoping to escape but he was too late and only got a bump on his nose as the door slammed shut     the lace apron    chapter 7   now said the canary in a tone more brisk than before we may talk together more freely as mrs yoop cannot hear us perhaps we can figure out a way to escape  open said woot the monkey still facing the door but his command had no effect and he slowly rejoined the others  you cannot open any door or window in this enchanted castle unless you are wearing the magic apron said the canary  what magic apron do you mean asked the tin owl in a curious voice  the lace one which the giantess always wears i have been her prisoner in this cage for several weeks and she hangs my cage in her bedroom every night so that she can keep her eye on me explained polychrome the canary therefore i have discovered that it is the magic apron that opens the doors and windows and nothing else can move them when she goes to bed mrs yoop hangs her apron on the bedpost and one morning she forgot to put it on when she commanded the door to open and the door would not move so then she put on the lace apron and the door obeyed her that was how i learned the magic power of the apron  i see i see said the little brown bear wagging his stuffed head then if we could get the apron from mrs yoop we could open the doors and escape from our prison  that is true and it is the plan i was about to suggest replied polychrome the canary-bird however i don't believe the owl could steal the apron or even the bear but perhaps the monkey could hide in her room at night and get the apron while she is asleep  i'll try it cried woot the monkey i'll try it this very night if i can manage to steal into her bedroom  you mustn't think about it though warned the bird for she can read your thoughts whenever she cares to do so and do not forget before you escape to take me with you once i am out of the power of the giantess i may discover a way to save us all  we won't forget our fairy friend promised the boy but perhaps you can tell me how to get into the bedroom  no declared polychrome i cannot advise you as to that you must watch for a chance and slip in when mrs yoop isn't looking  they talked it over for a while longer and then mrs yoop returned when she entered the door opened suddenly at her command and closed as soon as her huge form had passed through the doorway during that day she entered her bedroom several times on one errand or another but always she commanded the door to close behind her and her prisoners found not the slightest chance to leave the big hall in which they were confined  the green monkey thought it would be wise to make a friend of the big woman so as to gain her confidence so he sat on the back of her chair and chattered to her while she mended her stockings and sewed silver buttons on some golden shoes that were as big as row-boats this pleased the giantess and she would pause at times to pat the monkey's head the little brown bear curled up in a corner and lay still all day the owl and the canary found they could converse together in the bird language which neither the giantess nor the bear nor the monkey could understand so at times they twittered away to each other and passed the long dreary day quite cheerfully  after dinner mrs yoop took a big fiddle from a big cupboard and played such loud and dreadful music that her prisoners were all thankful when at last she stopped and said she was going to bed    after cautioning the monkey and bear and owl to behave themselves during the night she picked up the cage containing the canary and going to the door of her bedroom commanded it to open just then however she remembered she had left her fiddle lying upon a table so she went back for it and put it away in the cupboard and while her back was turned the green monkey slipped through the open door into her bedroom and hid underneath the bed the giantess being sleepy did not notice this and entering her room she made the door close behind her and then hung the bird-cage on a peg by the window then she began to undress first taking off the lace apron and laying it over the bedpost where it was within easy reach of her hand  as soon as mrs yoop was in bed the lights all went out and woot the monkey crouched under the bed and waited patiently until he heard the giantess snoring then he crept out and in the dark felt around until he got hold of the apron which he at once tied around his own waist  next woot tried to find the canary and there was just enough moonlight showing through the window to enable him to see where the cage hung but it was out of his reach at first he was tempted to leave polychrome and escape with his other friends but remembering his promise to the rainbow's daughter woot tried to think how to save her  a chair stood near the window and this showing dimly in the moonlight gave him an idea by pushing against it with all his might he found he could move the giant chair a few inches at a time so he pushed and pushed until the chair was beneath the bird-cage and then he sprang noiselessly upon the seat for his monkey form enabled him to jump higher than he could do as a boy and from there to the back of the chair and so managed to reach the cage and take it off the peg then down he sprang to the floor and made his way to the door    open he commanded and at once the door obeyed and swung open but his voice wakened mrs yoop who gave a wild cry and sprang out of bed with one bound the green monkey dashed through the doorway carrying the cage with him and before the giantess could reach the door it slammed shut and imprisoned her in her own bed-chamber  the noise she made pounding upon the door and her yells of anger and dreadful threats of vengeance filled all our friends with terror and woot the monkey was so excited that in the dark he could not find the outer door of the hall but the tin owl could see very nicely in the dark so he guided his friends to the right place and when all were grouped before the door woot commanded it to open the magic apron proved as powerful as when it had been worn by the giantess so a moment later they had rushed through the passage and were standing in the fresh night air outside the castle free to go wherever they willed     the menace of the forest    chapter 8   quick cried polychrome the canary we must hurry or mrs yoop may find some way to recapture us even now let us get out of her valley as soon as possible  so they set off toward the east moving as swiftly as they could and for a long time they could hear the yells and struggles of the imprisoned giantess the green monkey could run over the ground very swiftly and he carried with him the bird-cage containing polychrome the rainbow's daughter also the tin owl could skip and fly along at a good rate of speed his feathers rattling against one another with a tinkling sound as he moved but the little brown bear being stuffed with straw was a clumsy traveler and the others had to wait for him to follow  however they were not very long in reaching the ridge that led out of mrs yoop's valley and when they had passed this ridge and descended into the next valley they stopped to rest for the green monkey was tired  i believe we are safe now said polychrome when her cage was set down and the others had all gathered around it for mrs yoop dares not go outside of her own valley for fear of being captured by her enemies so we may take our time to consider what to do next  i'm afraid poor mrs yoop will starve to death if no one lets her out of her bedroom said woot who had a heart as kind as that of the tin woodman we've taken her magic apron away and now the doors will never open  don't worry about that advised polychrome mrs yoop has plenty of magic left to console her  are you sure of that asked the green monkey  yes for i've been watching her for weeks said the canary she has six magic hairpins which she wears in her hair and a magic ring which she wears on her thumb and which is invisible to all eyes except those of a fairy and magic bracelets on both her ankles so i am positive that she will manage to find a way out of her prison  she might transform the door into an archway suggested the little brown bear  that would be easy for her said the tin owl but i'm glad she was too angry to think of that before we got out of her valley  well we have escaped the big woman to be sure remarked the green monkey but we still wear the awful forms the cruel yookoohoo gave us how are we going to get rid of these shapes and become ourselves again  none could answer that question they sat around the cage brooding over the problem until the monkey fell asleep seeing this the canary tucked her head under her wing and also slept and the tin owl and the brown bear did not disturb them until morning came and it was broad daylight  i'm hungry said woot when he wakened for his knapsack of food had been left behind at the castle  then let us travel on until we can find something for you to eat returned the scarecrow bear  there is no use in your lugging my cage any farther declared the canary let me out and throw the cage away then i can fly with you and find my own breakfast of seeds also i can search for water and tell you where to find it  so the green monkey unfastened the door of the golden cage and the canary hopped out at first she flew high in the air and made great circles overhead but after a time she returned and perched beside them  at the east in the direction we were following announced the canary there is a fine forest with a brook running through it in the forest there may be fruits or nuts growing or berry bushes at its edge so let us go that way    they agreed to this and promptly set off this time moving more deliberately the tin owl which had guided their way during the night now found the sunshine very trying to his big eyes so he shut them tight and perched upon the back of the little brown bear which carried the owl's weight with ease the canary sometimes perched upon the green monkey's shoulder and sometimes fluttered on ahead of the party and in this manner they traveled in good spirits across that valley and into the next one to the east of it  this they found to be an immense hollow shaped like a saucer and on its farther edge appeared the forest which polychrome had seen from the sky  come to think of it said the tin owl waking up and blinking comically at his friends there's no object now in our traveling to the munchkin country my idea in going there was to marry nimmie amee but however much the munchkin girl may have loved a tin woodman i cannot reasonably expect her to marry a tin owl  there is some truth in that my friend remarked the brown bear and to think that i who was considered the handsomest scarecrow in the world am now condemned to be a scrubby no-account beast whose only redeeming feature is that he is stuffed with straw  consider my case please said woot the cruel giantess has made a monkey of a boy and that is the most dreadful deed of all  your color is rather pretty said the brown bear eyeing woot critically i have never seen a pea-green monkey before and it strikes me you are quite gorgeous  it isn't so bad to be a bird asserted the canary fluttering from one to another with a free and graceful motion but i long to enjoy my own shape again  as polychrome you were the loveliest maiden i have ever seen except of course ozma said the tin owl so the giantess did well to transform you into the loveliest of all birds if you were to be transformed at all but tell me since you are a fairy and have a fairy wisdom  do you think we shall be able to break these enchantments  queer things happen in the land of oz replied the canary again perching on the green monkey's shoulder and turning one bright eye thoughtfully toward her questioner mrs yoop has declared that none of her transformations can ever be changed even by herself but i believe that if we could get to glinda the good sorceress she might find a way to restore us to our natural shapes glinda as you know is the most powerful sorceress in the world and there are few things she cannot do if she tries  in that case said the little brown bear let us return southward and try to get to glinda's castle it lies in the quadling country you know so it is a good way from here  first however let us visit the forest and search for something to eat pleaded woot so they continued on to the edge of the forest which consisted of many tall and beautiful trees they discovered no fruit trees at first so the green monkey pushed on into the forest depths and the others followed close behind him  they were traveling quietly along under the shade of the trees when suddenly an enormous jaguar leaped upon them from a limb and with one blow of his paw sent the little brown bear tumbling over and over until he was stopped by a tree-trunk instantly they all took alarm the tin owl shrieked  hoot hoot and flew straight up to the branch of a tall tree although he could scarcely see where he was going the canary swiftly darted to a place beside the owl and the green monkey sprang up caught a limb and soon scrambled to a high perch of safety  the jaguar crouched low and with hungry eyes regarded the little brown bear which slowly got upon its feet and asked reproachfully   for goodness' sake beast what were you trying to do  trying to get my breakfast answered the jaguar with a snarl and i believe i've succeeded you ought to make a delicious meal unless you happen to be old and tough  i'm worse than that considered as a breakfast said the bear for i'm only a skin stuffed with straw and therefore not fit to eat  indeed cried the jaguar in a disappointed voice then you must be a magic bear or enchanted and i must seek my breakfast from among your companions  with this he raised his lean head to look up at the tin owl and the canary and the monkey and he lashed his tail upon the ground and growled as fiercely as any jaguar could  my friends are enchanted also said the little brown bear  all of them asked the jaguar  yes the owl is tin so you couldn't possibly eat him the canary is a fairy polychrome the daughter of the rainbow and you never could catch her because she can easily fly out of your reach  there still remains the green monkey remarked the jaguar hungrily he is neither made of tin nor stuffed with straw nor can he fly i'm pretty good at climbing trees myself so i think i'll capture the monkey and eat him for my breakfast  woot the monkey hearing this speech from his perch on the tree became much frightened for he knew the nature of jaguars and realized they could climb trees and leap from limb to limb with the agility of cats so he at once began to scamper through the forest as fast as he could go catching at a branch with his long monkey arms and swinging his green body through space to grasp another branch in a neighboring tree and so on while the jaguar followed him from below his eyes fixed steadfastly on his prey but presently woot got his feet tangled in the lace apron which he was still wearing and that tripped him in his flight and made him fall to the ground where the jaguar placed one huge paw upon him and said grimly   i've got you now  the fact that the apron had tripped him made woot remember its magic powers and in his terror he cried out  open without stopping to consider how this command might save him but at the word the earth opened at the exact spot where he lay under the jaguar's paw and his body sank downward the earth closing over it again the last thing woot the monkey saw as he glanced upward was the jaguar peering into the hole in astonishment    he's gone cried the beast with a long-drawn sigh of disappointment he's gone and now i shall have no breakfast  the clatter of the tin owl's wings sounded above him and the little brown bear came trotting up and asked   where is the monkey have you eaten him so quickly  no indeed answered the jaguar he disappeared into the earth before i could take one bite of him  and now the canary perched upon a stump a little way from the forest beast and said   i am glad our friend has escaped you but as it is natural for a hungry beast to wish his breakfast i will try to give you one  thank you replied the jaguar you're rather small for a full meal but it's kind of you to sacrifice yourself to my appetite  oh i don't intend to be eaten i assure you said the canary but as i am a fairy i know something of magic and though i am now transformed into a bird's shape i am sure i can conjure up a breakfast that will satisfy you  if you can work magic why don't you break the enchantment you are under and return to your proper form inquired the beast doubtingly  i haven't the power to do that answered the canary for mrs yoop the giantess who transformed me used a peculiar form of yookoohoo magic that is unknown to me however she could not deprive me of my own fairy knowledge so i will try to get you a breakfast  do you think a magic breakfast would taste good or relieve the pangs of hunger i now suffer asked the jaguar  i am sure it would what would you like to eat  give me a couple of fat rabbits said the beast  rabbits no indeed i'd not allow you to eat the dear little things declared polychrome the canary  well three or four squirrels then pleaded the jaguar  do you think me so cruel demanded the canary indignantly the squirrels are my especial friends  how about a plump owl asked the beast not a tin one you know but a real meat owl  neither beast nor bird shall you have said polychrome in a positive voice  give me a fish then there's a river a little way off proposed the jaguar  no living thing shall be sacrificed to feed you returned the canary  then what in the world do you expect me to eat said the jaguar in a scornful tone  how would mush-and-milk do asked the canary  the jaguar snarled in derision and lashed his tail against the ground angrily    give him some scrambled eggs on toast poly suggested the bear scarecrow he ought to like that  i will responded the canary and fluttering her wings she made a flight of three circles around the stump then she flew up to a tree and the bear and the owl and the jaguar saw that upon the stump had appeared a great green leaf upon which was a large portion of scrambled eggs on toast smoking hot  there said the bear eat your breakfast friend jaguar and be content  the jaguar crept closer to the stump and sniffed the fragrance of the scrambled eggs they smelled so good that he tasted them and they tasted so good that he ate the strange meal in a hurry proving he had been really hungry  i prefer rabbits he muttered licking his chops but i must admit the magic breakfast has filled my stomach full and brought me comfort so i'm much obliged for the kindness little fairy and i'll now leave you in peace  saying this he plunged into the thick underbrush and soon disappeared although they could hear his great body crashing through the bushes until he was far distant  that was a good way to get rid of the savage beast poly said the tin woodman to the canary but i'm surprised that you didn't give our friend woot a magic breakfast when you knew he was hungry  the reason for that answered polychrome was that my mind was so intent on other things that i quite forgot my power to produce food by magic but where is the monkey boy  gone said the scarecrow bear solemnly the earth has swallowed him up       the quarrelsome dragons    chapter 9   the green monkey sank gently into the earth for a little way and then tumbled swiftly through space landing on a rocky floor with a thump that astonished him then he sat up found that no bones were broken and gazed around him  he seemed to be in a big underground cave which was dimly lighted by dozens of big round discs that looked like moons they were not moons however as woot discovered when he had examined the place more carefully they were eyes the eyes were in the heads of enormous beasts whose bodies trailed far behind them each beast was bigger than an elephant and three times as long and there were a dozen or more of the creatures scattered here and there about the cavern on their bodies were big scales as round as pie-plates which were beautifully tinted in shades of green purple and orange on the ends of their long tails were clusters of jewels around the great moon-like eyes were circles of diamonds which sparkled in the subdued light that glowed from the eyes  woot saw that the creatures had wide mouths and rows of terrible teeth and from tales he had heard of such beings he knew he had fallen into a cavern inhabited by the great dragons that had been driven from the surface of the earth and were only allowed to come out once in a hundred years to search for food of course he had never seen dragons before yet there was no mistaking them for they were unlike any other living creatures  woot sat upon the floor where he had fallen staring around and the owners of the big eyes returned his look silently and motionless finally one of the dragons which was farthest away from him asked in a deep grave voice   what was that  and the greatest dragon of all who was just in front of the green monkey answered in a still deeper voice   it is some foolish animal from outside  is it good to eat inquired a smaller dragon beside the great one i'm hungry  hungry exclaimed all the dragons in a reproachful chorus and then the great one said chidingly  tut-tut my son you've no reason to be hungry at this time  why not asked the little dragon i haven't eaten anything in eleven years  eleven years is nothing remarked another dragon sleepily opening and closing his eyes i haven't feasted for eighty-seven years and i dare not get hungry for a dozen or so years to come children who eat between meals should be broken of the habit  all i had eleven years ago was a rhinoceros and that's not a full meal at all grumbled the young one and before that i had waited sixty-two years to be fed so it's no wonder i'm hungry  how old are you now asked woot forgetting his own dangerous position in his interest in the conversation  why i'm i'm  how old am i father asked the little dragon  goodness gracious what a child to ask questions do you want to keep me thinking all the time don't you know that thinking is very bad for dragons returned the big one impatiently  how old am i father persisted the small dragon  about six hundred and thirty i believe ask your mother  no don't said an old dragon in the background haven't i enough worries what with being wakened in the middle of a nap without being obliged to keep track of my children's ages  you've been fast asleep for over sixty years mother said the child dragon how long a nap do you wish  i should have slept forty years longer and this strange little green beast should be punished for falling into our cavern and disturbing us  i didn't know you were here and i didn't know i was going to fall in explained woot  nevertheless here you are said the great dragon and you have carelessly wakened our entire tribe so it stands to reason you must be punished  in what way inquired the green monkey trembling a little  give me time and i'll think of a way you're in no hurry are you asked the great dragon  no indeed cried woot take your time i'd much rather you'd all go to sleep again and punish me when you wake up in a hundred years or so  let me eat him pleaded the littlest dragon  he is too small said the father to eat this one green monkey would only serve to make you hungry for more and there are no more  quit this chatter and let me get to sleep protested another dragon yawning in a fearful manner for when he opened his mouth a sheet of flame leaped forth from it and made woot jump back to get out of its way    in his jump he bumped against the nose of a dragon behind him which opened its mouth to growl and shot another sheet of flame at him the flame was bright but not very hot yet woot screamed with terror and sprang forward with a great bound this time he landed on the paw of the great chief dragon who angrily raised his other front paw and struck the green monkey a fierce blow woot went sailing through the air and fell sprawling upon the rocky floor far beyond the place where the dragon tribe was grouped  all the great beasts were now thoroughly wakened and aroused and they blamed the monkey for disturbing their quiet the littlest dragon darted after woot and the others turned their unwieldy bodies in his direction and followed flashing from their eyes and mouths flames which lighted up the entire cavern  woot almost gave himself up for lost at that moment but he scrambled to his feet and dashed away to the farthest end of the cave the dragons following more leisurely because they were too clumsy to move fast perhaps they thought there was no need of haste as the monkey could not escape from the cave but away up at the end of the place the cavern floor was heaped with tumbled rocks so woot with an agility born of fear climbed from rock to rock until he found himself crouched against the cavern roof there he waited for he could go no farther while on over the tumbled rocks slowly crept the dragons the littlest one coming first because he was hungry as well as angry  the beasts had almost reached him when woot remembering his lace apron now sadly torn and soiled recovered his wits and shouted  open at the cry a hole appeared in the roof of the cavern just over his head and through it the sunlight streamed full upon the green monkey  the dragons paused astonished at the magic and blinking at the sunlight and this gave woot time to climb through the opening as soon as he reached the surface of the earth the hole closed again and the boy monkey realized with a thrill of joy that he had seen the last of the dangerous dragon family  he sat upon the ground still panting hard from his exertions when the bushes before him parted and his former enemy the jaguar appeared  don't run said the woodland beast as woot sprang up you are perfectly safe so far as i am concerned for since you so mysteriously disappeared i have had my breakfast i am now on my way home to sleep the rest of the day  oh indeed returned the green monkey in a tone both sorry and startled which of my friends did you manage to eat  none of them returned the jaguar with a sly grin i had a dish of magic scrambled eggs on toast and it wasn't a bad feast at all there isn't room in me for even you and i don't regret it because i judge from your green color that you are not ripe and would make an indifferent meal we jaguars have to be careful of our digestions farewell friend monkey follow the path i made through the bushes and you will find your friends  with this the jaguar marched on his way and woot took his advice and followed the trail he had made until he came to the place where the little brown bear and the tin owl and the canary were conferring together and wondering what had become of their comrade the green monkey       tommy kwikstep    chapter 10   our best plan said the scarecrow bear when the green monkey had related the story of his adventure with the dragons is to get out of this gillikin country as soon as we can and try to find our way to the castle of glinda the good sorceress there are too many dangers lurking here to suit me and glinda may be able to restore us to our proper forms  if we turn south now the tin owl replied we might go straight into the emerald city that's a place i wish to avoid for i'd hate to have my friends see me in this sad plight and he blinked his eyes and fluttered his tin wings mournfully  but i am certain we have passed beyond emerald city the canary assured him sailing lightly around their heads so should we turn south from here we would pass into the munchkin country and continuing south we would reach the quadling country where glinda's castle is located  well since you're sure of that let's start right away proposed the bear it's a long journey at the best and i'm getting tired of walking on four legs  i thought you never tired being stuffed with straw said woot  i mean that it annoys me to be obliged to go on all fours when two legs are my proper walking equipment replied the scarecrow i consider it beneath my dignity in other words my remarkable brains can tire through humiliation although my body cannot tire  that is one of the penalties of having brains remarked the tin owl with a sigh i have had no brains since i was a man of meat and so i never worry nevertheless i prefer my former manly form to this owl's shape and would be glad to break mrs yoop's enchantment as soon as possible i am so noisy just now that i disturb myself and he fluttered his wings with a clatter that echoed throughout the forest  so being all of one mind they turned southward traveling steadily on until the woods were left behind and the landscape turned from purple tints to blue tints which assured them they had entered the country of the munchkins  now i feel myself more safe said the scarecrow bear i know this country pretty well having been made here by a munchkin farmer and having wandered over these lovely blue lands many times seems to me indeed that i even remember that group of three tall trees ahead of us and if i do we are not far from the home of my friend jinjur  who is jinjur asked woot the green monkey  haven't you heard of jinjur exclaimed the scarecrow in surprise  no said woot is jinjur a man a woman a beast or a bird  jinjur is a girl explained the scarecrow bear she's a fine girl too although a bit restless and liable to get excited once a long time ago she raised an army of girls and called herself 'general jinjur' with her army she captured the emerald city and drove me out of it because i insisted that an army in oz was highly improper but ozma punished the rash girl and afterward jinjur and i became fast friends now jinjur lives peacefully on a farm near here and raises fields of cream-puffs chocolate-caramels and macaroons they say she's a pretty good farmer and in addition to that she's an artist and paints pictures so perfect that one can scarcely tell them from nature she often repaints my face for me when it gets worn or mussy and the lovely expression i wore when the giantess transformed me was painted by jinjur only a month or so ago  it was certainly a pleasant expression agreed woot  jinjur can paint anything continued the scarecrow bear with enthusiasm as they walked along together once when i came to her house my straw was old and crumpled so that my body sagged dreadfully i needed new straw to replace the old but jinjur had no straw on all her ranch and i was really unable to travel farther until i had been restuffed when i explained this to jinjur the girl at once painted a straw-stack which was so natural that i went to it and secured enough straw to fill all my body it was a good quality of straw too and lasted me a long time  this seemed very wonderful to woot who knew that such a thing could never happen in any place but a fairy country like oz  the munchkin country was much nicer than the gillikin country and all the fields were separated by blue fences with grassy lanes and paths of blue ground and the land seemed well cultivated they were on a little hill looking down upon this favored country but had not quite reached the settled parts when on turning a bend in the path they were halted by a form that barred their way  a more curious creature they had seldom seen even in the land of oz where curious creatures abound it had the head of a young man evidently a munchkin with a pleasant face and hair neatly combed but the body was very long for it had twenty legs ten legs on each side and this caused the body to stretch out and lie in a horizontal position so that all the legs could touch the ground and stand firm from the shoulders extended two small arms at least they seemed small beside so many legs  this odd creature was dressed in the regulation clothing of the munchkin people a dark blue coat neatly fitting the long body and each pair of legs having a pair of sky-blue trousers with blue-tinted stockings and blue leather shoes turned up at the pointed toes  i wonder who you are said polychrome the canary fluttering above the strange creature who had probably been asleep on the path  i sometimes wonder myself who i am replied the many-legged young man but in reality i am tommy kwikstep and i live in a hollow tree that fell to the ground with age i have polished the inside of it and made a door at each end and that's a very comfortable residence for me because it just fits my shape  how did you happen to have such a shape asked the scarecrow bear sitting on his haunches and regarding tommy kwikstep with a serious look is the shape natural    no it was wished on me replied tommy with a sigh i used to be very active and loved to run errands for anyone who needed my services that was how i got my name of tommy kwikstep i could run an errand more quickly than any other boy and so i was very proud of myself one day however i met an old lady who was a fairy or a witch or something of the sort and she said if i would run an errand for her to carry some magic medicine to another old woman she would grant me just one wish whatever the wish happened to be of course i consented and taking the medicine i hurried away it was a long distance mostly up hill and my legs began to grow weary without thinking what i was doing i said aloud  'dear me i wish i had twenty legs' and in an instant i became the unusual creature you see beside you twenty legs twenty on one man you may count them if you doubt my word  you've got 'em all right said woot the monkey who had already counted them  after i had delivered the magic medicine to the old woman i returned and tried to find the witch or fairy or whatever she was who had given me the unlucky wish so she could take it away again i've been searching for her ever since but never can i find her continued poor tommy kwikstep sadly  i suppose said the tin owl blinking at him you can travel very fast with those twenty legs  at first i was able to was the reply but i traveled so much searching for the fairy or witch or whatever she was that i soon got corns on my toes now a corn on one toe is not so bad but when you have a hundred toes as i have and get corns on most of them it is far from pleasant instead of running i now painfully crawl and although i try not to be discouraged i do hope i shall find that witch or fairy or whatever she was before long  i hope so too said the scarecrow but after all you have the pleasure of knowing you are unusual and therefore remarkable among the people of oz to be just like other persons is small credit to one while to be unlike others is a mark of distinction  that sounds very pretty returned tommy kwikstep but if you had to put on ten pair of trousers every morning and tie up twenty shoes you would prefer not to be so distinguished  was the witch or fairy or whatever she was an old person with wrinkled skin and half her teeth gone inquired the tin owl  no said tommy kwikstep  then she wasn't old mombi remarked the transformed emperor  i'm not interested in who it wasn't so much as i am in who it was said the twenty-legged young man and whatever or whomsoever she was she has managed to keep out of my way  if you found her do you suppose she'd change you back into a two-legged boy asked woot  perhaps so if i could run another errand for her and so earn another wish  would you really like to be as you were before asked polychrome the canary perching upon the green monkey's shoulder to observe tommy kwikstep more attentively  i would indeed was the earnest reply  then i will see what i can do for you promised the rainbow's daughter and flying to the ground she took a small twig in her bill and with it made several mystic figures on each side of tommy kwikstep  are you a witch or fairy or something of the sort he asked as he watched her wonderingly  the canary made no answer for she was busy but the scarecrow bear replied  yes she's something of the sort and a bird of a magician    the twenty-legged boy's transformation happened so queerly that they were all surprised at its method first tommy kwikstep's last two legs disappeared then the next two and the next and as each pair of legs vanished his body shortened all this while polychrome was running around him and chirping mystical words and when all the young man's legs had disappeared but two he noticed that the canary was still busy and cried out in alarm   stop stop leave me two of my legs or i shall be worse off than before  i know said the canary i'm only removing with my magic the corns from your last ten toes  thank you for being so thoughtful he said gratefully and now they noticed that tommy kwikstep was quite a nice looking young fellow  what will you do now asked woot the monkey  first he answered i must deliver a note which i've carried in my pocket ever since the witch or fairy or whatever she was granted my foolish wish and i am resolved never to speak again without taking time to think carefully on what i am going to say for i realize that speech without thought is dangerous and after i've delivered the note i shall run errands again for anyone who needs my services  so he thanked polychrome again and started away in a different direction from their own and that was the last they saw of tommy kwikstep     jinjur's ranch    chapter 11   as they followed a path down the blue-grass hillside the first house that met the view of the travelers was joyously recognized by the scarecrow bear as the one inhabited by his friend jinjur so they increased their speed and hurried toward it  on reaching the place however they found the house deserted the front door stood open but no one was inside in the garden surrounding the house were neat rows of bushes bearing cream-puffs and macaroons some of which were still green but others ripe and ready to eat farther back were fields of caramels and all the land seemed well cultivated and carefully tended they looked through the fields for the girl farmer but she was nowhere to be seen  well finally remarked the little brown bear let us go into the house and make ourselves at home that will be sure to please my friend jinjur who happens to be away from home just now when she returns she will be greatly surprised  would she care if i ate some of those ripe cream-puffs asked the green monkey  no indeed jinjur is very generous help yourself to all you want said the scarecrow bear  so woot gathered a lot of the cream-puffs that were golden yellow and filled with a sweet creamy substance and ate until his hunger was satisfied then he entered the house with his friends and sat in a rocking-chair just as he was accustomed to do when a boy the canary perched herself upon the mantel and daintily plumed her feathers the tin owl sat on the back of another chair the scarecrow squatted on his hairy haunches in the middle of the room  i believe i remember the girl jinjur remarked the canary in her sweet voice she cannot help us very much except to direct us on our way to glinda's castle for she does not understand magic but she's a good girl honest and sensible and i'll be glad to see her    all our troubles said the owl with a deep sigh arose from my foolish resolve to seek nimmie amee and make her empress of the winkies and while i wish to reproach no one i must say that it was woot the wanderer who put the notion into my head  well for my part i am glad he did responded the canary your journey resulted in saving me from the giantess and had you not traveled to the yoop valley i would still be mrs yoop's prisoner it is much nicer to be free even though i still bear the enchanted form of a canary-bird  do you think we shall ever be able to get our proper forms back again asked the green monkey earnestly  polychrome did not make reply at once to this important question but after a period of thoughtfulness she said   i have been taught to believe that there is an antidote for every magic charm yet mrs yoop insists that no power can alter her transformations i realize that my own fairy magic cannot do it although i have thought that we sky fairies have more power than is accorded to earth fairies the yookoohoo magic is admitted to be very strange in its workings and different from the magic usually practiced but perhaps glinda or ozma may understand it better than i in them lies our only hope unless they can help us we must remain forever as we are  a canary-bird on a rainbow wouldn't be so bad asserted the tin owl winking and blinking with his round tin eyes so if you can manage to find your rainbow again you need have little to worry about  that's nonsense friend chopper exclaimed woot i know just how polychrome feels a beautiful girl is much superior to a little yellow bird and a boy such as i was far better than a green monkey neither of us can be happy again unless we recover our rightful forms  i feel the same way announced the stuffed bear what do you suppose my friend the patchwork girl would think of me if she saw me wearing this beastly shape  she'd laugh till she cried admitted the tin owl for my part i'll have to give up the notion of marrying nimmie amee but i'll try not to let that make me unhappy if it's my duty i'd like to do my duty but if magic prevents my getting married i'll flutter along all by myself and be just as contented  their serious misfortunes made them all silent for a time and as their thoughts were busy in dwelling upon the evils with which fate had burdened them none noticed that jinjur had suddenly appeared in the doorway and was looking at them in astonishment the next moment her astonishment changed to anger for there in her best rocking-chair sat a green monkey a great shiny owl perched upon another chair and a brown bear squatted upon her parlor rug jinjur did not notice the canary but she caught up a broomstick and dashed into the room shouting as she came   get out of here you wild creatures how dare you enter my house  with a blow of her broom she knocked the brown bear over and the tin owl tried to fly out of her reach and made a great clatter with his tin wings the green monkey was so startled by the sudden attack that he sprang into the fireplace where there was fortunately no fire and tried to escape by climbing up the chimney but he found the opening too small and so was forced to drop down again then he crouched trembling in the fireplace his pretty green hair all blackened with soot and covered with ashes from this position woot watched to see what would happen next  stop jinjur stop cried the brown bear when the broom again threatened him don't you know me i'm your old friend the scarecrow  you're trying to deceive me you naughty beast i can see plainly that you are a bear and a mighty poor specimen of a bear too retorted the girl  that's because i'm not properly stuffed he assured her when mrs yoop transformed me she didn't realize i should have more stuffing  who is mrs yoop inquired jinjur pausing with the broom still upraised  a giantess in the gillikin country  oh i begin to understand and mrs yoop transformed you you are really the famous scarecrow of oz  i was jinjur just now i'm as you see me a miserable little brown bear with a poor quality of stuffing that tin owl is none other than our dear tin woodman nick chopper the emperor of the winkies while this green monkey is a nice little boy we recently became acquainted with woot the wanderer  and i said the canary flying close to jinjur am polychrome the daughter of the rainbow in the form of a bird  goodness me cried jinjur amazed that giantess must be a powerful sorceress and as wicked as she is powerful    she's a yookoohoo said polychrome fortunately we managed to escape from her castle and we are now on our way to glinda the good to see if she possesses the power to restore us to our former shapes  then i must beg your pardons all of you must forgive me said jinjur putting away the broom i took you to be a lot of wild unmannerly animals as was quite natural you are very welcome to my home and i'm sorry i haven't the power to help you out of your troubles please use my house and all that i have as if it were your own  at this declaration of peace the bear got upon his feet and the owl resumed his perch upon the chair and the monkey crept out of the fireplace jinjur looked at woot critically and scowled  for a green monkey said she you're the blackest creature i ever saw and you'll get my nice clean room all dirty with soot and ashes whatever possessed you to jump up the chimney  i i was scared explained woot somewhat ashamed  well you need renovating and that's what will happen to you right away come with me she commanded    what are you going to do asked woot  give you a good scrubbing said jinjur  now neither boys nor monkeys relish being scrubbed so woot shrank away from the energetic girl trembling fearfully but jinjur grabbed him by his paw and dragged him out to the back yard where in spite of his whines and struggles she plunged him into a tub of cold water and began to scrub him with a stiff brush and a cake of yellow soap  this was the hardest trial that woot had endured since he became a monkey but no protest had any influence with jinjur who lathered and scrubbed him in a business-like manner and afterward dried him with a coarse towel  the bear and the owl gravely watched this operation and nodded approval when woot's silky green fur shone clear and bright in the afternoon sun the canary seemed much amused and laughed a silvery ripple of laughter as she said   very well done my good jinjur i admire your energy and judgment but i had no idea a monkey could look so comical as this monkey did while he was being bathed  i'm not a monkey declared woot resentfully i'm just a boy in a monkey's shape that's all  if you can explain to me the difference said jinjur i'll agree not to wash you again that is unless you foolishly get into the fireplace all persons are usually judged by the shapes in which they appear to the eyes of others look at me woot what am i  woot looked at her  you're as pretty a girl as i've ever seen he replied  jinjur frowned that is she tried hard to frown  come out into the garden with me she said and i'll give you some of the most delicious caramels you ever ate they're a new variety that no one can grow but me and they have a heliotrope flavor     ozma and dorothy    chapter 12   in her magnificent palace in the emerald city the beautiful girl ruler of all the wonderful land of oz sat in her dainty boudoir with her friend princess dorothy beside her ozma was studying a roll of manuscript which she had taken from the royal library while dorothy worked at her embroidery and at times stooped to pat a shaggy little black dog that lay at her feet the little dog's name was toto and he was dorothy's faithful companion  to judge ozma of oz by the standards of our world you would think her very young perhaps fourteen or fifteen years of age yet for years she had ruled the land of oz and had never seemed a bit older dorothy appeared much younger than ozma she had been a little girl when first she came to the land of oz and she was a little girl still and would never seem to be a day older while she lived in this wonderful fairyland  oz was not always a fairyland i am told once it was much like other lands except it was shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that lay all around it thus preventing its people from all contact with the rest of the world seeing this isolation the fairy band of queen lurline passing over oz while on a journey enchanted the country and so made it a fairyland and queen lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted land of oz and then passed on and forgot all about it  from that moment no one in oz ever died those who were old remained old those who were young and strong did not change as years passed them by the children remained children always and played and romped to their hearts' content while all the babies lived in their cradles and were tenderly cared for and never grew up so people in oz stopped counting how old they were in years for years made no difference in their appearance and could not alter their station they did not get sick so there were no doctors among them accidents might happen to some on rare occasions it is true and while no one could die naturally as other people do it was possible that one might be totally destroyed such incidents however were very unusual and so seldom was there anything to worry over that the oz people were as happy and contented as can be  another strange thing about this fairy land of oz was that whoever managed to enter it from the outside world came under the magic spell of the place and did not change in appearance as long as they lived there so dorothy who now lived with ozma seemed just the same sweet little girl she had been when first she came to this delightful fairyland  perhaps all parts of oz might not be called truly delightful but it was surely delightful in the neighborhood of the emerald city where ozma reigned her loving influence was felt for many miles around but there were places in the mountains of the gillikin country and the forests of the quadling country and perhaps in far-away parts of the munchkin and winkie countries where the inhabitants were somewhat rude and uncivilized and had not yet come under the spell of ozma's wise and kindly rule also when oz first became a fairyland it harbored several witches and magicians and sorcerers and necromancers who were scattered in various parts but most of these had been deprived of their magic powers and ozma had issued a royal edict forbidding anyone in her dominions to work magic except glinda the good and the wizard of oz ozma herself being a real fairy knew a lot of magic but she only used it to benefit her subjects  this little explanation will help you to understand better the story you are reading but most of it is already known to those who are familiar with the oz people whose adventures they have followed in other oz books  ozma and dorothy were fast friends and were much together everyone in oz loved dorothy almost as well as they did their lovely ruler for the little kansas girl's good fortune had not spoiled her or rendered her at all vain she was just the same brave and true and adventurous child as before she lived in a royal palace and became the chum of the fairy ozma  in the room in which the two sat which was one of ozma's private suite of apartments hung the famous magic picture this was the source of constant interest to little dorothy one had but to stand before it and wish to see what any person was doing and at once a scene would flash upon the magic canvas which showed exactly where that person was and like our own moving pictures would reproduce the actions of that person as long as you cared to watch them so today when dorothy tired of her embroidery she drew the curtains from before the magic picture and wished to see what her friend button bright was doing button bright she saw was playing ball with ojo the munchkin boy so dorothy next wished to see what her aunt em was doing the picture showed aunt em quietly engaged in darning socks for uncle henry so dorothy wished to see what her old friend the tin woodman was doing  the tin woodman was then just leaving his tin castle in the company of the scarecrow and woot the wanderer dorothy had never seen this boy before so she wondered who he was also she was curious to know where the three were going for she noticed woot's knapsack and guessed they had started on a long journey she asked ozma about it but ozma did not know  that afternoon dorothy again saw the travelers in the magic picture but they were merely tramping through the country and dorothy was not much interested in them a couple of days later however the girl being again with ozma wished to see her friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman in the magic picture and on this occasion found them in the great castle of mrs yoop the giantess who was at the time about to transform them both dorothy and ozma now became greatly interested and watched the transformations with indignation and horror  what a wicked giantess exclaimed dorothy  yes answered ozma she must be punished for this cruelty to our friends and to the poor boy who is with them  after this they followed the adventure of the little brown bear and the tin owl and the green monkey with breathless interest and were delighted when they escaped from mrs yoop they did not know then who the canary was but realized it must be the transformation of some person of consequence whom the giantess had also enchanted    when finally the day came when the adventurers headed south into the munchkin country dorothy asked anxiously   can't something be done for them ozma can't you change 'em back into their own shapes they've suffered enough from these dreadful transformations seems to me  i've been studying ways to help them ever since they were transformed replied ozma mrs yoop is now the only yookoohoo in my dominions and the yookoohoo magic is very peculiar and hard for others to understand yet i am resolved to make the attempt to break these enchantments i may not succeed but i shall do the best i can from the directions our friends are taking i believe they are going to pass by jinjur's ranch so if we start now we may meet them there would you like to go with me dorothy  of course answered the little girl i wouldn't miss it for anything  then order the red wagon said ozma of oz and we will start at once  dorothy ran to do as she was bid while ozma went to her magic room to make ready the things she believed she would need in half an hour the red wagon stood before the grand entrance of the palace and before it was hitched the wooden sawhorse which was ozma's favorite steed    this sawhorse while made of wood was very much alive and could travel swiftly and without tiring to keep the ends of his wooden legs from wearing down short ozma had shod the sawhorse with plates of pure gold his harness was studded with brilliant emeralds and other jewels and so while he himself was not at all handsome his outfit made a splendid appearance  since the sawhorse could understand her spoken words ozma used no reins to guide him she merely told him where to go when she came from the palace with dorothy they both climbed into the red wagon and then the little dog toto ran up and asked   are you going to leave me behind dorothy  dorothy looked at ozma who smiled in return and said   toto may go with us if you wish him to  so dorothy lifted the little dog into the wagon for while he could run fast he could not keep up with the speed of the wonderful sawhorse  away they went over hills and through meadows covering the ground with astonishing speed it is not surprising therefore that the red wagon arrived before jinjur's house just as that energetic young lady had finished scrubbing the green monkey and was about to lead him to the caramel patch     the restoration    chapter 13   the tin owl gave a hoot of delight when he saw the red wagon draw up before jinjur's house and the brown bear grunted and growled with glee and trotted toward ozma as fast as he could wobble as for the canary it flew swiftly to dorothy's shoulder and perched there saying in her ear   thank goodness you have come to our rescue  but who are you asked dorothy  don't you know returned the canary  no for the first time we noticed you in the magic picture you were just a bird as you are now but we've guessed that the giant woman had transformed you as she did the others  yes i'm polychrome the rainbow's daughter announced the canary  goodness me cried dorothy how dreadful  well i make a rather pretty bird i think returned polychrome but of course i'm anxious to resume my own shape and get back upon my rainbow  ozma will help you i'm sure said dorothy how does it feel scarecrow to be a bear she asked addressing her old friend  i don't like it declared the scarecrow bear this brutal form is quite beneath the dignity of a wholesome straw man  and think of me said the owl perching upon the dashboard of the red wagon with much noisy clattering of his tin feathers don't i look horrid dorothy with eyes several sizes too big for my body and so weak that i ought to wear spectacles  well said dorothy critically as she looked him over you're nothing to brag of i must confess but ozma will soon fix you up again  the green monkey had hung back bashful at meeting two lovely girls while in the form of a beast but jinjur now took his hand and led him forward while she introduced him to ozma and woot managed to make a low bow not really ungraceful before her girlish majesty the ruler of oz  you have all been forced to endure a sad experience said ozma and so i am anxious to do all in my power to break mrs yoop's enchantments but first tell me how you happened to stray into that lonely valley where yoop castle stands  between them they related the object of their journey the scarecrow bear telling of the tin woodman's resolve to find nimmie amee and marry her as a just reward for her loyalty to him woot told of their adventures with the loons of loonville and the tin owl described the manner in which they had been captured and transformed by the giantess then polychrome related her story and when all had been told and dorothy had several times reproved toto for growling at the tin owl ozma remained thoughtful for a while pondering upon what she had heard finally she looked up and with one of her delightful smiles said to the anxious group   i am not sure my magic will be able to restore every one of you because your transformations are of such a strange and unusual character indeed mrs yoop was quite justified in believing no power could alter her enchantments however i am sure i can restore the scarecrow to his original shape he was stuffed with straw from the beginning and even the yookoohoo magic could not alter that the giantess was merely able to make a bear's shape of a man's shape but the bear is stuffed with straw just as the man was so i feel confident i can make a man of the bear again  hurrah cried the brown bear and tried clumsily to dance a jig of delight  as for the tin woodman his case is much the same resumed ozma still smiling the power of the giantess could not make him anything but a tin creature whatever shape she transformed him into so it will not be impossible to restore him to his manly form anyhow i shall test my magic at once and see if it will do what i have promised    she drew from her bosom a small silver wand and making passes with the wand over the head of the bear she succeeded in the brief space of a moment in breaking his enchantment the original scarecrow of oz again stood before them well stuffed with straw and with his features nicely painted upon the bag which formed his head  the scarecrow was greatly delighted as you may suppose and he strutted proudly around while the powerful fairy ozma of oz broke the enchantment that had transformed the tin woodman and made a tin owl into a tin man again  now then chirped the canary eagerly i'm next ozma  but your case is different replied ozma no longer smiling but wearing a grave expression on her sweet face i shall have to experiment on you polychrome and i may fail in all my attempts  she then tried two or three different methods of magic hoping one of them would succeed in breaking polychrome's enchantment but still the rainbow's daughter remained a canary-bird finally however she experimented in another way she transformed the canary into a dove and then transformed the dove into a speckled hen and then changed the speckled hen into a rabbit and then the rabbit into a fawn and at the last after mixing several powders and sprinkling them upon the fawn the yookoohoo enchantment was suddenly broken and before them stood one of the daintiest and loveliest creatures in any fairyland in the world polychrome was as sweet and merry in disposition as she was beautiful and when she danced and capered around in delight her beautiful hair floated around her like a golden mist and her many-hued raiment as soft as cobwebs reminded one of drifting clouds in a summer sky  woot was so awed by the entrancing sight of this exquisite sky fairy that he quite forgot his own sad plight until he noticed ozma gazing upon him with an intent expression that denoted sympathy and sorrow dorothy whispered in her friend's ear but the ruler of oz shook her head sadly  jinjur noticing this and understanding ozma's looks took the paw of the green monkey in her own hand and patted it softly  never mind she said to him you are a very beautiful color and a monkey can climb better than a boy and do a lot of other things no boy can ever do  what's the matter asked woot a sinking feeling at his heart is ozma's magic all used up    ozma herself answered him  your form of enchantment my poor boy she said pityingly is different from that of the others indeed it is a form that is impossible to alter by any magic known to fairies or yookoohoos the wicked giantess was well aware when she gave you the form of a green monkey that the green monkey must exist in the land of oz for all future time  woot drew a long sigh  well that's pretty hard luck he said bravely but if it can't be helped i must endure it that's all i don't like being a monkey but what's the use of kicking against my fate  they were all very sorry for him and dorothy anxiously asked ozma   couldn't glinda save him  no was the reply glinda's power in transformations is no greater than my own before i left my palace i went to my magic room and studied woot's case very carefully i found that no power can do away with the green monkey he might transfer or exchange his form with some other person it is true but the green monkey we cannot get rid of by any magic arts known to science  but see here said the scarecrow who had listened intently to this explanation why not put the monkey's form on some one else  who would agree to make the change asked ozma if by force we caused anyone else to become a green monkey we would be as cruel and wicked as mrs yoop and what good would an exchange do she continued suppose for instance we worked the enchantment and made toto into a green monkey at the same moment woot would become a little dog  leave me out of your magic please said toto with a reproachful growl i wouldn't become a green monkey for anything  and i wouldn't become a dog said woot a green monkey is much better than a dog it seems to me  that is only a matter of opinion answered toto  now here's another idea said the scarecrow my brains are working finely today you must admit why not transform toto into woot the wanderer and then have them exchange forms the dog would become a green monkey and the monkey would have his own natural shape again  to be sure cried jinjur that's a fine idea  leave me out of it said toto i won't do it  wouldn't you be willing to become a green monkey see what a pretty color it is so that this poor boy could be restored to his own shape asked jinjur pleadingly  no said toto  i don't like that plan the least bit declared dorothy for then i wouldn't have any little dog  but you'd have a green monkey in his place persisted jinjur who liked woot and wanted to help him  i don't want a green monkey said dorothy positively  don't speak of this again i beg of you said woot this is my own misfortune and i would rather suffer it alone than deprive princess dorothy of her dog or deprive the dog of his proper shape and perhaps even her majesty ozma of oz might not be able to transform anyone else into the shape of woot the wanderer  yes i believe i might do that ozma returned but woot is quite right we are not justified in inflicting upon anyone man or dog the form of a green monkey also it is certain that in order to relieve the boy of the form he now wears we must give it to someone else who would be forced to wear it always  i wonder said dorothy thoughtfully if we couldn't find someone in the land of oz who would be willing to become a green monkey seems to me a monkey is active and spry and he can climb trees and do a lot of clever things and green isn't a bad color for a monkey it makes him unusual  i wouldn't ask anyone to take this dreadful form said woot it wouldn't be right you know i've been a monkey for some time now and i don't like it it makes me ashamed to be a beast of this sort when by right of birth i'm a boy so i'm sure it would be wicked to ask anyone else to take my place  they were all silent for they knew he spoke the truth dorothy was almost ready to cry with pity and ozma's sweet face was sad and disturbed the scarecrow rubbed and patted his stuffed head to try to make it think better while the tin woodman went into the house and began to oil his tin joints so that the sorrow of his friends might not cause him to weep weeping is liable to rust tin and the emperor prided himself upon his highly polished body now doubly dear to him because for a time he had been deprived of it  polychrome had danced down the garden paths and back again a dozen times for she was seldom still a moment yet she had heard ozma's speech and understood very well woot's unfortunate position but the rainbow's daughter even while dancing could think and reason very clearly and suddenly she solved the problem in the nicest possible way coming close to ozma she said   your majesty all this trouble was caused by the wickedness of mrs yoop the giantess yet even now that cruel woman is living in her secluded castle enjoying the thought that she has put this terrible enchantment on woot the wanderer even now she is laughing at our despair because we can find no way to get rid of the green monkey very well we do not wish to get rid of it let the woman who created the form wear it herself as a just punishment for her wickedness i am sure your fairy power can give to mrs yoop the form of woot the wanderer even at this distance from her and then it will be possible to exchange the two forms mrs yoop will become the green monkey and woot will recover his own form again    ozma's face brightened as she listened to this clever proposal  thank you polychrome said she the task you propose is not so easy as you suppose but i will make the attempt and perhaps i may succeed       the green monkey    chapter 14   they now entered the house and as an interested group watched jinjur at ozma's command build a fire and put a kettle of water over to boil the ruler of oz stood before the fire silent and grave while the others realizing that an important ceremony of magic was about to be performed stood quietly in the background so as not to interrupt ozma's proceedings only polychrome kept going in and coming out humming softly to herself as she danced for the rainbow's daughter could not keep still for long and the four walls of a room always made her nervous and ill at ease she moved so noiselessly however that her movements were like the shifting of sunbeams and did not annoy anyone  when the water in the kettle bubbled ozma drew from her bosom two tiny packets containing powders these powders she threw into the kettle and after briskly stirring the contents with a branch from a macaroon bush ozma poured the mystic broth upon a broad platter which jinjur had placed upon the table as the broth cooled it became as silver reflecting all objects from its smooth surface like a mirror  while her companions gathered around the table eagerly attentive and dorothy even held little toto in her arms that he might see ozma waved her wand over the mirror-like surface at once it reflected the interior of yoop castle and in the big hall sat mrs yoop in her best embroidered silken robes engaged in weaving a new lace apron to replace the one she had lost    the giantess seemed rather uneasy as if she had a faint idea that someone was spying upon her for she kept looking behind her and this way and that as though expecting danger from an unknown source perhaps some yookoohoo instinct warned her woot saw that she had escaped from her room by some of the magical means at her disposal after her prisoners had escaped her she was now occupying the big hall of her castle as she used to do also woot thought from the cruel expression on the face of the giantess that she was planning revenge on them as soon as her new magic apron was finished  but ozma was now making passes over the platter with her silver wand and presently the form of the giantess began to shrink in size and to change its shape and now in her place sat the form of woot the wanderer and as if suddenly realizing her transformation mrs yoop threw down her work and rushed to a looking-glass that stood against the wall of her room when she saw the boy's form reflected as her own she grew violently angry and dashed her head against the mirror smashing it to atoms  just then ozma was busy with her magic wand making strange figures and she had also placed her left hand firmly upon the shoulder of the green monkey so now as all eyes were turned upon the platter the form of mrs yoop gradually changed again she was slowly transformed into the green monkey and at the same time woot slowly regained his natural form  it was quite a surprise to them all when they raised their eyes from the platter and saw woot the wanderer standing beside ozma and when they glanced at the platter again it reflected nothing more than the walls of the room in jinjur's house in which they stood the magic ceremonial was ended and ozma of oz had triumphed over the wicked giantess  what will become of her i wonder said dorothy as she drew a long breath  she will always remain a green monkey replied ozma and in that form she will be unable to perform any magical arts whatsoever she need not be unhappy however and as she lives all alone in her castle she probably won't mind the transformation very much after she gets used to it  anyhow it serves her right declared dorothy and all agreed with her  but said the kind hearted tin woodman i'm afraid the green monkey will starve for mrs yoop used to get her food by magic and now that the magic is taken away from her what can she eat  why she'll eat what other monkeys do returned the scarecrow even in the form of a green monkey she's a very clever person and i'm sure her wits will show her how to get plenty to eat  don't worry about her advised dorothy she didn't worry about you and her condition is no worse than the condition she imposed on poor woot she can't starve to death in the land of oz that's certain and if she gets hungry at times it's no more than the wicked thing deserves let's forget mrs yoop for in spite of her being a yookoohoo our fairy friends have broken all of her transformations       the man of tin    chapter 15   ozma and dorothy were quite pleased with woot the wanderer whom they found modest and intelligent and very well mannered the boy was truly grateful for his release from the cruel enchantment and he promised to love revere and defend the girl ruler of oz forever afterward as a faithful subject  you may visit me at my palace if you wish said ozma where i will be glad to introduce you to two other nice boys ojo the munchkin and button-bright  thank your majesty replied woot and then he turned to the tin woodman and inquired  what are your further plans mr emperor will you still seek nimmie amee and marry her or will you abandon the quest and return to the emerald city and your own castle  the tin woodman now as highly polished and well-oiled as ever reflected a while on this question and then answered   well i see no reason why i should not find nimmie amee we are now in the munchkin country where we are perfectly safe and if it was right for me before our enchantment to marry nimmie amee and make her empress of the winkies it must be right now when the enchantment has been broken and i am once more myself am i correct friend scarecrow  you are indeed answered the scarecrow no one can oppose such logic  but i'm afraid you don't love nimmie amee suggested dorothy  that is just because i can't love anyone replied the tin woodman but if i cannot love my wife i can at least be kind to her and all husbands are not able to do that  do you s'pose nimmie amee still loves you after all these years asked dorothy  i'm quite sure of it and that is why i am going to her to make her happy woot the wanderer thinks i ought to reward her for being faithful to me after my meat body was chopped to pieces and i became tin what do you think ozma  ozma smiled as she said   i do not know your nimmie amee and so i cannot tell what she most needs to make her happy but there is no harm in your going to her and asking her if she still wishes to marry you if she does we will give you a grand wedding at the emerald city and afterward as empress of the winkies nimmie amee would become one of the most important ladies in all oz  so it was decided that the tin woodman would continue his journey and that the scarecrow and woot the wanderer should accompany him as before polychrome also decided to join their party somewhat to the surprise of all  i hate to be cooped up in a palace she said to ozma and of course the first time i meet my rainbow i shall return to my own dear home in the skies where my fairy sisters are even now awaiting me and my father is cross because i get lost so often but i can find my rainbow just as quickly while traveling in the munchkin country as i could if living in the emerald city or any other place in oz so i shall go with the tin woodman and help him woo nimmie amee  dorothy wanted to go too but as the tin woodman did not invite her to join his party she felt she might be intruding if she asked to be taken she hinted but she found he didn't take the hint it is quite a delicate matter for one to ask a girl to marry him however much she loves him and perhaps the tin woodman did not desire to have too many looking on when he found his old sweetheart nimmie amee so dorothy contented herself with the thought that she would help ozma prepare a splendid wedding feast to be followed by a round of parties and festivities when the emperor of the winkies reached the emerald city with his bride  ozma offered to take them all in the red wagon to a place as near to the great munchkin forest as a wagon could get the red wagon was big enough to seat them all and so bidding good-bye to jinjur who gave woot a basket of ripe cream-puffs and caramels to take with him ozma commanded the wooden sawhorse to start and the strange creature moved swiftly over the lanes and presently came to the road of yellow bricks this road led straight to a dense forest where the path was too narrow for the red wagon to proceed farther so here the party separated  ozma and dorothy and toto returned to the emerald city after wishing their friends a safe and successful journey while the tin woodman the scarecrow woot the wanderer and polychrome the rainbow's daughter prepared to push their way through the thick forest however these forest paths were well known to the tin man and the scarecrow who felt quite at home among the trees  i was born in this grand forest said nick chopper the tin emperor speaking proudly and it was here that the witch enchanted my axe and i lost different parts of my meat body until i became all tin here also for it is a big forest nimmie amee lived with the wicked witch and at the other edge of the trees stands the cottage of my friend ku-klip the famous tinsmith who made my present beautiful form  he must be a clever workman declared woot admiringly  he is simply wonderful declared the tin woodman  i shall be glad to make his acquaintance said woot  if you wish to meet with real cleverness remarked the scarecrow you should visit the munchkin farmer who first made me i won't say that my friend the emperor isn't all right for a tin man but any judge of beauty can understand that a scarecrow is far more artistic and refined  you are too soft and flimsy said the tin woodman  you are too hard and stiff said the scarecrow and this was as near to quarreling as the two friends ever came polychrome laughed at them both as well she might and woot hastened to change the subject  at night they all camped underneath the trees the boy ate cream-puffs for supper and offered polychrome some but she preferred other food and at daybreak sipped the dew that was clustered thick on the forest flowers then they tramped onward again and presently the scarecrow paused and said   it was on this very spot that dorothy and i first met the tin woodman who was rusted so badly that none of his joints would move but after we had oiled him up he was as good as new and accompanied us to the emerald city  ah that was a sad experience asserted the tin woodman soberly i was caught in a rainstorm while chopping down a tree for exercise and before i realized it i was firmly rusted in every joint there i stood axe in hand but unable to move for days and weeks and months indeed i have never known exactly how long the time was but finally along came dorothy and i was saved see this is the very tree i was chopping at the time i rusted  you cannot be far from your old home in that case said woot  no my little cabin stands not a great way off but there is no occasion for us to visit it our errand is with nimmie amee and her house is somewhat farther away to the left of us  didn't you say she lives with a wicked witch who makes her a slave asked the boy  she did but she doesn't was the reply i am told the witch was destroyed when dorothy's house fell on her so now nimmie amee must live all alone i haven't seen her of course since the witch was crushed for at that time i was standing rusted in the forest and had been there a long time but the poor girl must have felt very happy to be free from her cruel mistress  well said the scarecrow let's travel on and find nimmie amee lead on your majesty since you know the way and we will follow  so the tin woodman took a path that led through the thickest part of the forest and they followed it for some time the light was dim here because vines and bushes and leafy foliage were all about them and often the tin man had to push aside the branches that obstructed their way or cut them off with his axe after they had proceeded some distance the emperor suddenly stopped short and exclaimed  good gracious  the scarecrow who was next first bumped into his friend and then peered around his tin body and said in a tone of wonder   well i declare  woot the wanderer pushed forward to see what was the matter and cried out in astonishment     for goodness' sake  then the three stood motionless staring hard until polychrome's merry laughter rang out behind them and aroused them from their stupor  in the path before them stood a tin man who was the exact duplicate of the tin woodman he was of the same size he was jointed in the same manner and he was made of shining tin from top to toe but he stood immovable with his tin jaws half parted and his tin eyes turned upward in one of his hands was held a long gleaming sword yes there was the difference the only thing that distinguished him from the emperor of the winkies this tin man bore a sword while the tin woodman bore an axe  it's a dream it must be a dream gasped woot  that's it of course said the scarecrow there couldn't be two tin woodmen  no agreed polychrome dancing nearer to the stranger this one is a tin soldier don't you see his sword  the tin woodman cautiously put out one tin hand and felt of his double's arm then he said in a voice that trembled with emotion   who are you friend  there was no reply  can't you see he's rusted just as you were once asked polychrome laughing again here nick chopper lend me your oil-can a minute  the tin woodman silently handed her his oil-can without which he never traveled and polychrome first oiled the stranger's tin jaws and then worked them gently to and fro until the tin soldier said   that's enough thank you i can now talk but please oil my other joints  woot seized the oil-can and did this but all the others helped wiggle the soldier's joints as soon as they were oiled until they moved freely  the tin soldier seemed highly pleased at his release he strutted up and down the path saying in a high thin voice       the soldier is a splendid man       when marching on parade     and when he meets the enemy       he never is afraid     he rights the wrongs of nations       his country's flag defends     the foe he'll fight with great delight       but seldom fights his friends     captain fyter    chapter 16   are you really a soldier asked woot when they had all watched this strange tin person parade up and down the path and proudly flourish his sword  i was a soldier was the reply but i've been a prisoner to mr rust so long that i don't know exactly what i am  but dear me cried the tin woodman sadly perplexed how came you to be made of tin  that answered the soldier is a sad sad story i was in love with a beautiful munchkin girl who lived with a wicked witch the witch did not wish me to marry the girl so she enchanted my sword which began hacking me to pieces when i lost my legs i went to the tinsmith ku-klip and he made me some tin legs when i lost my arms ku-klip made me tin arms and when i lost my head he made me this fine one out of tin it was the same way with my body and finally i was all tin but i was not unhappy for ku-klip made a good job of me having had experience in making another tin man before me  yes observed the tin woodman it was ku-klip who made me but tell me what was the name of the munchkin girl you were in love with  she is called nimmie amee said the tin soldier  hearing this they were all so astonished that they were silent for a time regarding the stranger with wondering looks finally the tin woodman ventured to ask   and did nimmie amee return your love  not at first admitted the soldier when first i marched into the forest and met her she was weeping over the loss of her former sweetheart a woodman whose name was nick chopper  that is me said the tin woodman  she told me he was nicer than a soldier because he was all made of tin and shone beautifully in the sun she said a tin man appealed to her artistic instincts more than an ordinary meat man as i was then but i did not despair because her tin sweetheart had disappeared and could not be found and finally nimmie amee permitted me to call upon her and we became friends it was then that the wicked witch discovered me and became furiously angry when i said i wanted to marry the girl she enchanted my sword as i said and then my troubles began when i got my tin legs nimmie amee began to take an interest in me when i got my tin arms she began to like me better than ever and when i was all made of tin she said i looked like her dear nick chopper and she would be willing to marry me  the day of our wedding was set and it turned out to be a rainy day nevertheless i started out to get nimmie amee because the witch had been absent for some time and we meant to elope before she got back as i traveled the forest paths the rain wetted my joints but i paid no attention to this because my thoughts were all on my wedding with beautiful nimmie amee and i could think of nothing else until suddenly my legs stopped moving then my arms rusted at the joints and i became frightened and cried for help for now i was unable to oil myself no one heard my calls and before long my jaws rusted and i was unable to utter another sound so i stood helpless in this spot hoping some wanderer would come my way and save me but this forest path is seldom used and i have been standing here so long that i have lost all track of time in my mind i composed poetry and sang songs but not a sound have i been able to utter but this desperate condition has now been relieved by your coming my way and i must thank you for my rescue  this is wonderful said the scarecrow heaving a stuffy long sigh i think ku-klip was wrong to make two tin men just alike and the strangest thing of all is that both you tin men fell in love with the same girl  as for that returned the soldier seriously i must admit i lost my ability to love when i lost my meat heart ku-klip gave me a tin heart to be sure but it doesn't love anything as far as i can discover and merely rattles against my tin ribs which makes me wish i had no heart at all  yet in spite of this condition you were going to marry nimmie amee  well you see i had promised to marry her and i am an honest man and always try to keep my promises i didn't like to disappoint the poor girl who had been disappointed by one tin man already  that was not my fault declared the emperor of the winkies and then he related how he also had rusted in the forest and after a long time had been rescued by dorothy and the scarecrow and had traveled with them to the emerald city in search of a heart that could love  if you have found such a heart sir said the soldier i will gladly allow you to marry nimmie amee in my place  if she loves you best sir answered the woodman i shall not interfere with your wedding her for to be quite frank with you i cannot yet love nimmie amee as i did before i became tin  still one of you ought to marry the poor girl remarked woot and if she likes tin men there is not much choice between you why don't you draw lots for her  that wouldn't be right said the scarecrow  the girl should be permitted to choose her own husband asserted polychrome you should both go to her and allow her to take her choice then she will surely be happy  that to me seems a very fair arrangement said the tin soldier  i agree to it said the tin woodman shaking the hand of his twin to show the matter was settled may i ask your name sir he continued  before i was so cut up replied the other i was known as captain fyter but afterward i was merely called 'the tin soldier'  well captain if you are agreeable let us now go to nimmie amee's house and let her choose between us  very well and if we meet the witch we will both fight her you with your axe and i with my sword  the witch is destroyed announced the scarecrow and as they walked away he told the tin soldier of much that had happened in the land of oz since he had stood rusted in the forest  i must have stood there longer than i had imagined he said thoughtfully     the workshop of ku-klip    chapter 17   it was not more than a two hours' journey to the house where nimmie amee had lived but when our travelers arrived there they found the place deserted the door was partly off its hinges the roof had fallen in at the rear and the interior of the cottage was thick with dust not only was the place vacant but it was evident that no one had lived there for a long time    i suppose said the scarecrow as they all stood looking wonderingly at the ruined house that after the wicked witch was destroyed nimmie amee became lonely and went somewhere else to live  one could scarcely expect a young girl to live all alone in a forest added woot she would want company of course and so i believe she has gone where other people live  and perhaps she is still crying her poor little heart out because no tin man comes to marry her suggested polychrome  well in that case it is the clear duty of you two tin persons to seek nimmie amee until you find her declared the scarecrow  i do not know where to look for the girl said the tin soldier for i am almost a stranger to this part of the country  i was born here said the tin woodman but the forest has few inhabitants except the wild beasts i cannot think of anyone living near here with whom nimmie amee might care to live  why not go to ku-klip and ask him what has become of the girl proposed polychrome  that struck them all as being a good suggestion so once more they started to tramp through the forest taking the direct path to ku-klip's house for both the tin twins knew the way having followed it many times  ku-klip lived at the far edge of the great forest his house facing the broad plains of the munchkin country that lay to the eastward but when they came to this residence by the forest's edge the tinsmith was not at home  it was a pretty place all painted dark blue with trimmings of lighter blue there was a neat blue fence around the yard and several blue benches had been placed underneath the shady blue trees which marked the line between forest and plain there was a blue lawn before the house which was a good sized building ku-klip lived in the front part of the house and had his work-shop in the back part where he had also built a lean-to addition in order to give him more room  although they found the tinsmith absent on their arrival there was smoke coming out of his chimney which proved that he would soon return  and perhaps nimmie amee will be with him said the scarecrow in a cheerful voice  while they waited the tin woodman went to the door of the workshop and finding it unlocked entered and looked curiously around the room where he had been made  it seems almost like home to me he told his friends who had followed him in the first time i came here i had lost a leg so i had to carry it in my hand while i hopped on the other leg all the way from the place in the forest where the enchanted axe cut me i remember that old ku-klip carefully put my meat leg into a barrel i think that is the same barrel still standing in the corner yonder and then at once he began to make a tin leg for me he worked fast and with skill and i was much interested in the job  my experience was much the same said the tin soldier i used to bring all the parts of me which the enchanted sword had cut away here to the tinsmith and ku-klip would put them into the barrel  i wonder said woot if those cast-off parts of you two unfortunates are still in that barrel in the corner  i suppose so replied the tin woodman in the land of oz no part of a living creature can ever be destroyed  if that is true how was that wicked witch destroyed inquired woot  why she was very old and was all dried up and withered before oz became a fairyland explained the scarecrow only her magic arts had kept her alive so long and when dorothy's house fell upon her she just turned to dust and was blown away and scattered by the wind i do not think however that the parts cut away from these two young men could ever be entirely destroyed and if they are still in those barrels they are likely to be just the same as when the enchanted axe or sword severed them  it doesn't matter however said the tin woodman our tin bodies are more brilliant and durable and quite satisfy us  yes the tin bodies are best agreed the tin soldier nothing can hurt them  unless they get dented or rusted said woot but both the tin men frowned on him  scraps of tin of all shapes and sizes lay scattered around the workshop also there were hammers and anvils and soldering irons and a charcoal furnace and many other tools such as a tinsmith works with against two of the side walls had been built stout work-benches and in the center of the room was a long table at the end of the shop which adjoined the dwelling were several cupboards  after examining the interior of the workshop until his curiosity was satisfied woot said   i think i will go outside until ku-klip comes it does not seem quite proper for us to take possession of his house while he is absent  that is true agreed the scarecrow and they were all about to leave the room when the tin woodman said  wait a minute and they halted in obedience to the command       the tin woodman talks to himself    chapter 18   the tin woodman had just noticed the cupboards and was curious to know what they contained so he went to one of them and opened the door there were shelves inside and upon one of the shelves which was about on a level with his tin chin the emperor discovered a head it looked like a doll's head only it was larger and he soon saw it was the head of some person it was facing the tin woodman and as the cupboard door swung back the eyes of the head slowly opened and looked at him the tin woodman was not at all surprised for in the land of oz one runs into magic at every turn  dear me said the tin woodman staring hard it seems as if i had met you somewhere before good morning sir  you have the advantage of me replied the head i never saw you before in my life  still your face is very familiar persisted the tin woodman pardon me but may i ask if you eh eh if you ever had a body  yes at one time answered the head but that is so long ago i can't remember it did you think with a pleasant smile that i was born just as i am that a head would be created without a body  no of course not said the other but how came you to lose your body  well i can't recollect the details you'll have to ask ku-klip about it returned the head for curious as it may seem to you my memory is not good since my separation from the rest of me i still possess my brains and my intellect is as good as ever but my memory of some of the events i formerly experienced is quite hazy    how long have you been in this cupboard asked the emperor  i don't know  haven't you a name  oh yes said the head i used to be called nick chopper when i was a woodman and cut down trees for a living  good gracious cried the tin woodman in astonishment if you are nick chopper's head then you are me or i'm you or or  what relation are we anyhow  don't ask me replied the head for my part i'm not anxious to claim relationship with any common manufactured article like you you may be all right in your class but your class isn't my class you're tin  the poor emperor felt so bewildered that for a time he could only stare at his old head in silence then he said   i must admit that i wasn't at all bad looking before i became tin you're almost handsome for meat if your hair was combed you'd be quite attractive  how do you expect me to comb my hair without help demanded the head indignantly i used to keep it smooth and neat when i had arms but after i was removed from the rest of me my hair got mussed and old ku-klip never has combed it for me  i'll speak to him about it said the tin woodman do you remember loving a pretty munchkin girl named nimmie amee  no answered the head that is a foolish question the heart in my body when i had a body might have loved someone for all i know but a head isn't made to love it's made to think  oh do you think then  i used to think  you must have been shut up in this cupboard for years and years what have you thought about in all that time  nothing that's another foolish question a little reflection will convince you that i have had nothing to think about except the boards on the inside of the cupboard door and it didn't take me long to think of everything about those boards that could be thought of then of course i quit thinking  and are you happy  happy what's that  don't you know what happiness is inquired the tin woodman  i haven't the faintest idea whether it's round or square or black or white or what it is and if you will pardon my lack of interest in it i will say that i don't care  the tin woodman was much puzzled by these answers his traveling companions had grouped themselves at his back and had fixed their eyes on the head and listened to the conversation with much interest but until now they had not interrupted because they thought the tin woodman had the best right to talk to his own head and renew acquaintance with it  but now the tin soldier remarked   i wonder if my old head happens to be in any of these cupboards and he proceeded to open all the cupboard doors but no other head was to be found on any of the shelves  oh well never mind said woot the wanderer i can't imagine what anyone wants of a cast-off head anyhow  i can understand the soldier's interest asserted polychrome dancing around the grimy workshop until her draperies formed a cloud around her dainty form for sentimental reasons a man might like to see his old head once more just as one likes to revisit an old home  and then to kiss it good-bye added the scarecrow  i hope that tin thing won't try to kiss me goodbye exclaimed the tin woodman's former head and i don't see what right you folks have to disturb my peace and comfort either  you belong to me the tin woodman declared  i do not  you and i are one  we've been parted asserted the head it would be unnatural for me to have any interest in a man made of tin please close the door and leave me alone  i did not think that my old head could be so disagreeable said the emperor i i'm quite ashamed of myself meaning you  you ought to be glad that i've enough sense to know what my rights are retorted the head in this cupboard i am leading a simple life peaceful and dignified and when a mob of people in whom i am not interested disturb me they are the disagreeable ones not i  with a sigh the tin woodman closed and latched the cupboard door and turned away  well said the tin soldier if my old head would have treated me as coldly and in so unfriendly a manner as your old head has treated you friend chopper i'm glad i could not find it  yes i'm rather surprised at my head myself replied the tin woodman thoughtfully i thought i had a more pleasant disposition when i was made of meat  but just then old ku-klip the tinsmith arrived and he seemed surprised to find so many visitors ku-klip was a stout man and a short man he had his sleeves rolled above his elbows showing muscular arms and he wore a leathern apron that covered all the front of him and was so long that woot was surprised he didn't step on it and trip whenever he walked and ku-klip had a gray beard that was almost as long as his apron and his head was bald on top and his ears stuck out from his head like two fans over his eyes which were bright and twinkling he wore big spectacles it was easy to see that the tinsmith was a kind hearted man as well as a merry and agreeable one  oh-ho he cried in a joyous bass voice here are both my tin men come to visit me and they and their friends are welcome indeed i'm very proud of you two characters i assure you for you are so perfect that you are proof that i'm a good workman sit down sit down all of you if you can find anything to sit on and tell me why you are here  so they found seats and told him all of their adventures that they thought he would like to know ku-klip was glad to learn that nick chopper the tin woodman was now emperor of the winkies and a friend of ozma of oz and the tinsmith was also interested in the scarecrow and polychrome  he turned the straw man around examining him curiously and patted him on all sides and then said   you are certainly wonderful but i think you would be more durable and steady on your legs if you were made of tin would you like me to   no indeed interrupted the scarecrow hastily i like myself better as i am  but to polychrome the tinsmith said   nothing could improve you my dear for you are the most beautiful maiden i have ever seen it is pure happiness just to look at you    that is praise indeed from so skillful a workman returned the rainbow's daughter laughing and dancing in and out the room  then it must be this boy you wish me to help said ku-klip looking at woot  no said woot we are not here to seek your skill but have merely come to you for information  then between them they related their search for nimmie amee whom the tin woodman explained he had resolved to marry yet who had promised to become the bride of the tin soldier before he unfortunately became rusted and when the story was told they asked ku-klip if he knew what had become of nimmie amee  not exactly replied the old man but i know that she wept bitterly when the tin soldier did not come to marry her as he had promised to do the old witch was so provoked at the girl's tears that she beat nimmie amee with her crooked stick and then hobbled away to gather some magic herbs with which she intended to transform the girl into an old hag so that no one would again love her or care to marry her it was while she was away on this errand that dorothy's house fell on the wicked witch and she turned to dust and blew away when i heard this good news i sent nimmie amee to find the silver shoes which the witch had worn but dorothy had taken them with her to the emerald city    yes we know all about those silver shoes said the scarecrow  well continued ku-klip after that nimmie amee decided to go away from the forest and live with some people she was acquainted with who had a house on mount munch i have never seen the girl since  do you know the name of the people on mount munch with whom she went to live asked the tin woodman  no nimmie amee did not mention her friend's name and i did not ask her she took with her all that she could carry of the goods that were in the witch's house and she told me i could have the rest but when i went there i found nothing worth taking except some magic powders that i did not know how to use and a bottle of magic glue  what is magic glue asked woot  it is a magic preparation with which to mend people when they cut themselves one time long ago i cut off one of my fingers by accident and i carried it to the witch who took down her bottle and glued it on again for me see showing them his finger it is as good as ever it was no one else that i ever heard of had this magic glue and of course when nick chopper cut himself to pieces with his enchanted axe and captain fyter cut himself to pieces with his enchanted sword the witch would not mend them or allow me to glue them together because she had herself wickedly enchanted the axe and sword nothing remained but for me to make them new parts out of tin but as you see tin answered the purpose very well and i am sure their tin bodies are a great improvement on their meat bodies  very true said the tin soldier  i quite agree with you said the tin woodman i happened to find my old head in your cupboard a while ago and certainly it is not as desirable a head as the tin one i now wear  by the way said the tin soldier what ever became of my old head ku-klip  and of the different parts of our bodies added the tin woodman  let me think a minute replied ku-klip if i remember right you two boys used to bring me most of your parts when they were cut off and i saved them in that barrel in the corner you must not have brought me all the parts for when i made chopfyt i had hard work finding enough pieces to complete the job i finally had to finish him with one arm  who is chopfyt inquired woot  oh haven't i told you about chopfyt exclaimed ku-klip of course not and he's quite a curiosity too you'll be interested in hearing about chopfyt this is how he happened   one day after the witch had been destroyed and nimmie amee had gone to live with her friends on mount munch i was looking around the shop for something and came upon the bottle of magic glue which i had brought from the old witch's house it occurred to me to piece together the odds and ends of you two people which of course were just as good as ever and see if i couldn't make a man out of them if i succeeded i would have an assistant to help me with my work and i thought it would be a clever idea to put to some practical use the scraps of nick chopper and captain fyter there were two perfectly good heads in my cupboard and a lot of feet and legs and parts of bodies in the barrel so i set to work to see what i could do  first i pieced together a body gluing it with the witch's magic glue which worked perfectly that was the hardest part of my job however because the bodies didn't match up well and some parts were missing but by using a piece of captain fyter here and a piece of nick chopper there i finally got together a very decent body with heart and all the trimmings complete  whose heart did you use in making the body asked the tin woodman anxiously  [illustration  meat glue]  i can't tell for the parts had no tags on them and one heart looks much like another after the body was completed i glued two fine legs and feet onto it one leg was nick chopper's and one was captain fyter's and finding one leg longer than the other i trimmed it down to make them match i was much disappointed to find that i had but one arm there was an extra leg in the barrel but i could find only one arm having glued this onto the body i was ready for the head and i had some difficulty in making up my mind which head to use finally i shut my eyes and reached out my hand toward the cupboard shelf and the first head i touched i glued upon my new man  it was mine declared the tin soldier gloomily  no it was mine asserted ku-klip for i had given you another in exchange for it the beautiful tin head you now wear when the glue had dried my man was quite an interesting fellow i named him chopfyt using a part of nick chopper's name and a part of captain fyter's name because he was a mixture of both your cast-off parts chopfyt was interesting as i said but he did not prove a very agreeable companion he complained bitterly because i had given him but one arm as if it were my fault and he grumbled because the suit of blue munchkin clothes which i got for him from a neighbor did not fit him perfectly    ah that was because he was wearing my old head remarked the tin soldier i remember that head used to be very particular about its clothes  as an assistant the old tinsmith continued chopfyt was not a success he was awkward with tools and was always hungry he demanded something to eat six or eight times a day so i wondered if i had fitted his insides properly indeed chopfyt ate so much that little food was left for myself so when he proposed one day to go out into the world and seek adventures i was delighted to be rid of him i even made him a tin arm to take the place of the missing one and that pleased him very much so that we parted good friends  what became of chopfyt after that the scarecrow inquired  i never heard he started off toward the east into the plains of the munchkin country and that was the last i ever saw of him  it seems to me said the tin woodman reflectively that you did wrong in making a man out of our cast-off parts it is evident that chopfyt could with justice claim relationship with both of us  don't worry about that advised ku-klip cheerfully it is not likely that you will ever meet the fellow and if you should meet him he doesn't know who he is made of for i never told him the secret of his manufacture indeed you are the only ones who know of it and you may keep the secret to yourselves if you wish to  never mind chopfyt said the scarecrow our business now is to find poor nimmie amee and let her choose her tin husband to do that it seems from the information ku-klip has given us we must travel to mount munch  if that's the programme let us start at once suggested woot  so they all went outside where they found polychrome dancing about among the trees and talking with the birds and laughing as merrily as if she had not lost her rainbow and so been separated from all her fairy sisters  they told her they were going to mount munch and she replied   very well i am as likely to find my rainbow there as here and any other place is as likely as there it all depends on the weather do you think it looks like rain  they shook their heads and polychrome laughed again and danced on after them when they resumed their journey     the invisible country    chapter 19   they were proceeding so easily and comfortably on their way to mount munch that woot said in a serious tone of voice   i'm afraid something is going to happen  why asked polychrome dancing around the group of travelers  because said the boy thoughtfully i've noticed that when we have the least reason for getting into trouble something is sure to go wrong just now the weather is delightful the grass is beautifully blue and quite soft to our feet the mountain we are seeking shows clearly in the distance and there is no reason anything should happen to delay us in getting there our troubles all seem to be over and well that's why i'm afraid he added with a sigh  dear me remarked the scarecrow what unhappy thoughts you have to be sure this is proof that born brains cannot equal manufactured brains for my brains dwell only on facts and never borrow trouble when there is occasion for my brains to think they think but i would be ashamed of my brains if they kept shooting out thoughts that were merely fears and imaginings such as do no good but are likely to do harm  for my part said the tin woodman i do not think at all but allow my velvet heart to guide me at all times  the tinsmith filled my hollow head with scraps and clippings of tin said the soldier and he told me they would do nicely for brains but when i begin to think the tin scraps rattle around and get so mixed that i'm soon bewildered so i try not to think my tin heart is almost as useless to me for it is hard and cold so i'm sure the red velvet heart of my friend nick chopper is a better guide  thoughtless people are not unusual observed the scarecrow but i consider them more fortunate than those who have useless or wicked thoughts and do not try to curb them your oil can friend woodman is filled with oil but you only apply the oil to your joints drop by drop as you need it and do not keep spilling it where it will do no good thoughts should be restrained in the same way as your oil and only applied when necessary and for a good purpose if used carefully thoughts are good things to have  polychrome laughed at him for the rainbow's daughter knew more about thoughts than the scarecrow did but the others were solemn feeling they had been rebuked and tramped on in silence  suddenly woot who was in the lead looked around and found that all his comrades had mysteriously disappeared but where could they have gone to the broad plain was all about him and there were neither trees nor bushes that could hide even a rabbit nor any hole for one to fall into yet there he stood alone  surprise had caused him to halt and with a thoughtful and puzzled expression on his face he looked down at his feet it startled him anew to discover that he had no feet he reached out his hands but he could not see them he could feel his hands and arms and body he stamped his feet on the grass and knew they were there but in some strange way they had become invisible  while woot stood wondering a crash of metal sounded in his ears and he heard two heavy bodies tumble to the earth just beside him  good gracious exclaimed the voice of the tin woodman  mercy me cried the voice of the tin soldier  why didn't you look where you were going asked the tin woodman reproachfully  i did but i couldn't see you said the tin soldier something has happened to my tin eyes i can't see you even now nor can i see anyone else  it's the same way with me admitted the tin woodman    woot couldn't see either of them although he heard them plainly and just then something smashed against him unexpectedly and knocked him over but it was only the straw-stuffed body of the scarecrow that fell upon him and while he could not see the scarecrow he managed to push him off and rose to his feet just as polychrome whirled against him and made him tumble again  sitting upon the ground the boy asked   can you see us poly  no indeed answered the rainbow's daughter we've all become invisible  how did it happen do you suppose inquired the scarecrow lying where he had fallen  we have met with no enemy answered polychrome so it must be that this part of the country has the magic quality of making people invisible even fairies falling under the charm we can see the grass and the flowers and the stretch of plain before us and we can still see mount munch in the distance but we cannot see ourselves or one another  well what are we to do about it demanded woot  i think this magic affects only a small part of the plain replied polychrome perhaps there is only a streak of the country where an enchantment makes people become invisible so if we get together and hold hands we can travel toward mount munch until the enchanted streak is passed  all right said woot jumping up give me your hand polychrome where are you  here she answered whistle woot and keep whistling until i come to you  so woot whistled and presently polychrome found him and grasped his hand  someone must help me up said the scarecrow lying near them so they found the straw man and sat him upon his feet after which he held fast to polychrome's other hand  nick chopper and the tin soldier had managed to scramble up without assistance but it was awkward for them and the tin woodman said   i don't seem to stand straight somehow but my joints all work so i guess i can walk  guided by his voice they reached his side where woot grasped his tin fingers so they might keep together  the tin soldier was standing near by and the scarecrow soon touched him and took hold of his arm  i hope you're not wobbly said the straw man for if two of us walk unsteadily we will be sure to fall  i'm not wobbly the tin soldier assured him but i'm certain that one of my legs is shorter than the other i can't see it to tell what's gone wrong but i'll limp on with the rest of you until we are out of this enchanted territory  they now formed a line holding hands and turning their faces toward mount munch resumed their journey they had not gone far however when a terrible growl saluted their ears the sound seemed to come from a place just in front of them so they halted abruptly and remained silent listening with all their ears  i smell straw cried a hoarse harsh voice with more growls and snarls i smell straw and i'm a hip-po-gy-raf who loves straw and eats all he can find i want to eat this straw where is it where is it  the scarecrow hearing this trembled but kept silent all the others were silent too hoping that the invisible beast would be unable to find them but the creature sniffed the odor of the straw and drew nearer and nearer to them until he reached the tin woodman on one end of the line it was a big beast and it smelled of the tin woodman and grated two rows of enormous teeth against the emperor's tin body  bah that's not straw said the harsh voice and the beast advanced along the line to woot  meat pooh you're no good i can't eat meat grumbled the beast and passed on to polychrome  sweetmeats and perfume cobwebs and dew nothing to eat in a fairy like you said the creature  now the scarecrow was next to polychrome in the line and he realized if the beast devoured his straw he would be helpless for a long time because the last farmhouse was far behind them and only grass covered the vast expanse of plain so in his fright he let go of polychrome's hand and put the hand of the tin soldier in that of the rainbow's daughter then he slipped back of the line and went to the other end where he silently seized the tin woodman's hand  meantime the beast had smelled the tin soldier and found he was the last of the line  that's funny growled the hip-po-gy-raf i can smell straw but i can't find it well it's here somewhere and i must hunt around until i do find it for i'm hungry  his voice was now at the left of them so they started on hoping to avoid him and traveled as fast as they could in the direction of mount munch  i don't like this invisible country said woot with a shudder we can't tell how many dreadful invisible beasts are roaming around us or what danger we'll come to next  quit thinking about danger please said the scarecrow warningly  why asked the boy  if you think of some dreadful thing it's liable to happen but if you don't think of it and no one else thinks of it it just can't happen do you see  no answered woot i won't be able to see much of anything until we escape from this enchantment  but they got out of the invisible strip of country as suddenly as they had entered it and the instant they got out they stopped short for just before them was a deep ditch running at right angles as far as their eyes could see and stopping all further progress toward mount munch  it's not so very wide said woot but i'm sure none of us can jump across it  polychrome began to laugh and the scarecrow said  what's the matter  look at the tin men she said with another burst of merry laughter  woot and the scarecrow looked and the tin men looked at themselves  it was the collision said the tin woodman regretfully i knew something was wrong with me and now i can see that my side is dented in so that i lean over toward the left it was the soldier's fault he shouldn't have been so careless  it is your fault that my right leg is bent making it shorter than the other so that i limp badly retorted the soldier you shouldn't have stood where i was walking  you shouldn't have walked where i was standing replied the tin woodman  it was almost a quarrel so polychrome said soothingly   never mind friends as soon as we have time i am sure we can straighten the soldier's leg and get the dent out of the woodman's body the scarecrow needs patting into shape too for he had a bad tumble but our first task is to get over this ditch  yes the ditch is the most important thing just now added woot  they were standing in a row looking hard at the unexpected barrier when a fierce growl from behind them made them all turn quickly out of the invisible country marched a huge beast with a thick leathery skin and a surprisingly long neck the head on the top of this neck was broad and flat and the eyes and mouth were very big and the nose and ears very small when the head was drawn down toward the beast's shoulders the neck was all wrinkles but the head could shoot up very high indeed if the creature wished it to  dear me exclaimed the scarecrow this must be the hip-po-gy-raf  quite right said the beast and you're the straw which i'm to eat for my dinner oh how i love straw i hope you don't resent my affectionate appetite  with its four great legs it advanced straight toward the scarecrow but the tin woodman and the tin soldier both sprang in front of their friend and flourished their weapons  keep off said the tin woodman warningly or i'll chop you with my axe  keep off said the tin soldier or i'll cut you with my sword  would you really do that asked the hip-po-gy-raf in a disappointed voice      we would they both replied and the tin woodman added  the scarecrow is our friend and he would be useless without his straw stuffing so as we are comrades faithful and true we will defend our friend's stuffing against all enemies  the hip-po-gy-raf sat down and looked at them sorrowfully  when one has made up his mind to have a meal of delicious straw and then finds he can't have it it is certainly hard luck he said and what good is the straw man to you or to himself when the ditch keeps you from going any further  well we can go back again suggested woot  true said the hip-po and if you do you'll be as disappointed as i am that's some comfort anyhow  the travelers looked at the beast and then they looked across the ditch at the level plain beyond on the other side the grass had grown tall and the sun had dried it so there was a fine crop of hay that only needed to be cut and stacked  why don't you cross over and eat hay the boy asked the beast  i'm not fond of hay replied the hip-po-gy-raf straw is much more delicious to my notion and it's more scarce in this neighborhood too also i must confess that i can't get across the ditch for my body is too heavy and clumsy for me to jump the distance i can stretch my neck across though and you will notice that i've nibbled the hay on the farther edge not because i liked it but because one must eat and if one can't get the sort of food he desires he must take what is offered or go hungry  ah i see you are a philosopher remarked the scarecrow  no i'm just a hip-po-gy-raf was the reply  polychrome was not afraid of the big beast she danced close to him and said   if you can stretch your neck across the ditch why not help us over we can sit on your big head one at a time and then you can lift us across  yes i can it is true answered the hip-po but i refuse to do it unless  he added and stopped short  unless what asked polychrome  unless you first allow me to eat the straw with which the scarecrow is stuffed  no said the rainbow's daughter that is too high a price to pay our friend's straw is nice and fresh for he was restuffed only a little while ago  i know agreed the hip-po-gy-raf that's why i want it if it was old musty straw i wouldn't care for it  please lift us across pleaded polychrome  no replied the beast since you refuse my generous offer i can be as stubborn as you are  after that they were all silent for a time but then the scarecrow said bravely   friends let us agree to the beast's terms give him my straw and carry the rest of me with you across the ditch once on the other side the tin soldier can cut some of the hay with his sharp sword and you can stuff me with that material until we reach a place where there is straw it is true i have been stuffed with straw all my life and it will be somewhat humiliating to be filled with common hay but i am willing to sacrifice my pride in a good cause moreover to abandon our errand and so deprive the great emperor of the winkies or this noble soldier of his bride would be equally humiliating if not more so  you're a very honest and clever man exclaimed the hip-po-gy-raf admiringly when i have eaten your head perhaps i also will become clever  you're not to eat my head you know returned the scarecrow hastily my head isn't stuffed with straw and i cannot part with it when one loses his head he loses his brains  very well then you may keep your head said the beast  the scarecrow's companions thanked him warmly for his loyal sacrifice to their mutual good and then he laid down and permitted them to pull the straw from his body as fast as they did this the hip-po-gy-raf ate up the straw and when all was consumed polychrome made a neat bundle of the clothes and boots and gloves and hat and said she would carry them while woot tucked the scarecrow's head under his arm and promised to guard its safety  now then said the tin woodman keep your promise beast and lift us over the ditch  m-m-m-mum but that was a fine dinner said the hip-po smacking his thick lips in satisfaction and i'm as good as my word sit on my head one at a time and i'll land you safely on the other side  he approached close to the edge of the ditch and squatted down polychrome climbed over his big body and sat herself lightly upon the flat head holding the bundle of the scarecrow's raiment in her hand slowly the elastic neck stretched out until it reached the far side of the ditch when the beast lowered his head and permitted the beautiful fairy to leap to the ground  woot made the queer journey next and then the tin soldier and the tin woodman went over and all were well pleased to have overcome this serious barrier to their progress  now soldier cut the hay said the scarecrow's head which was still held by woot the wanderer  i'd like to but i can't stoop over with my bent leg without falling replied captain fyter  what can we do about that leg anyhow asked woot appealing to polychrome  she danced around in a circle several times without replying and the boy feared she had not heard him but the rainbow's daughter was merely thinking upon the problem and presently she paused beside the tin soldier and said   i've been taught a little fairy magic but i've never before been asked to mend tin legs with it so i'm not sure i can help you it all depends on the good will of my unseen fairy guardians so i'll try and if i fail you will be no worse off than you are now    she danced around the circle again and then laid both hands upon the twisted tin leg and sang in her sweet voice       fairy powers come to my aid     this bent leg of tin is made     make it straight and strong and true     and i'll render thanks to you  ah murmured captain fyter in a glad voice as she withdrew her hands and danced away and they saw he was standing straight as ever because his leg was as shapely and strong as it had been before his accident  the tin woodman had watched polychrome with much interest and he now said   please take the dent out of my side poly for i am more crippled than was the soldier  so the rainbow's daughter touched his side lightly and sang       here's a dent by accident     such a thing was never meant     fairy powers so wondrous great     make our dear tin woodman straight  good cried the emperor again standing erect and strutting around to show his fine figure your fairy magic may not be able to accomplish all things sweet polychrome but it works splendidly on tin thank you very much  the hay the hay pleaded the scarecrow's head  oh yes the hay said woot what are you waiting for captain fyter  at once the tin soldier set to work cutting hay with his sword and in a few minutes there was quite enough with which to stuff the scarecrow's body woot and polychrome did this and it was no easy task because the hay packed together more than straw and as they had little experience in such work their job when completed left the scarecrow's arms and legs rather bunchy also there was a hump on his back which made woot laugh and say it reminded him of a camel but it was the best they could do and when the head was fastened on to the body they asked the scarecrow how he felt  a little heavy and not quite natural he cheerfully replied but i'll get along somehow until we reach a straw-stack don't laugh at me please because i'm a little ashamed of myself and i don't want to regret a good action  they started at once in the direction of mount munch and as the scarecrow proved very clumsy in his movements woot took one of his arms and the tin woodman the other and so helped their friend to walk in a straight line  and the rainbow's daughter as before danced ahead of them and behind them and all around them and they never minded her odd ways because to them she was like a ray of sunshine       over night    chapter 20   the land of the munchkins is full of surprises as our travelers had already learned and although mount munch was constantly growing larger as they advanced toward it they knew it was still a long way off and were not certain by any means that they had escaped all danger or encountered their last adventure  the plain was broad and as far as the eye could see there seemed to be a level stretch of country between them and the mountain but toward evening they came upon a hollow in which stood a tiny blue munchkin dwelling with a garden around it and fields of grain filling in all the rest of the hollow  they did not discover this place until they came close to the edge of it and they were astonished at the sight that greeted them because they had imagined that this part of the plain had no inhabitants  it's a very small house woot declared i wonder who lives there  the way to find out is to knock on the door and ask replied the tin woodman perhaps it is the home of nimmie amee  is she a dwarf asked the boy  no indeed nimmie amee is a full sized woman  then i'm sure she couldn't live in that little house said woot  let's go down suggested the scarecrow i'm almost sure i can see a straw-stack in the back yard  they descended the hollow which was rather steep at the sides and soon came to the house which was indeed rather small woot knocked upon a door that was not much higher than his waist but got no reply he knocked again but not a sound was heard  smoke is coming out of the chimney announced polychrome who was dancing lightly through the garden where cabbages and beets and turnips and the like were growing finely  then someone surely lives here said woot and knocked again  now a window at the side of the house opened and a queer head appeared it was white and hairy and had a long snout and little round eyes the ears were hidden by a blue sunbonnet tied under the chin  oh it's a pig exclaimed woot  pardon me i am mrs squealina swyne wife of professor grunter swyne and this is our home said the one in the window what do you want  what sort of a professor is your husband inquired the tin woodman curiously  he is professor of cabbage culture and corn perfection he is very famous in his own family and would be the wonder of the world if he went abroad said mrs swyne in a voice that was half proud and half irritable i must also inform you intruders that the professor is a dangerous individual for he files his teeth every morning until they are sharp as needles if you are butchers you'd better run away and avoid trouble  we are not butchers the tin woodman assured her  then what are you doing with that axe and why has the other tin man a sword  they are the only weapons we have to defend our friends from their enemies explained the emperor of the winkies and woot added   do not be afraid of us mrs swyne for we are harmless travelers the tin men and the scarecrow never eat anything and polychrome feasts only on dewdrops as for me i'm rather hungry but there is plenty of food in your garden to satisfy me  professor swyne now joined his wife at the window looking rather scared in spite of the boy's assuring speech he wore a blue munchkin hat with pointed crown and broad brim and big spectacles covered his eyes he peeked around from behind his wife and after looking hard at the strangers he said   my wisdom assures me that you are merely travelers as you say and not butchers butchers have reason to be afraid of me but you are safe we cannot invite you in for you are too big for our house but the boy who eats is welcome to all the carrots and turnips he wants make yourselves at home in the garden and stay all night if you like but in the morning you must go away for we are quiet people and do not care for company  may i have some of your straw asked the scarecrow  help yourself replied professor swyne  for pigs they're quite respectable remarked woot as they all went toward the straw-stack  i'm glad they didn't invite us in said captain fyter i hope i'm not too particular about my associates but i draw the line at pigs  the scarecrow was glad to be rid of his hay for during the long walk it had sagged down and made him fat and squatty and more bumpy than at first  i'm not specially proud he said but i love a manly figure such as only straw stuffing can create i've not felt like myself since that hungry hip-po ate my last straw  polychrome and woot set to work removing the hay and then they selected the finest straw crisp and golden and with it stuffed the scarecrow anew he certainly looked better after the operation and he was so pleased at being reformed that he tried to dance a little jig and almost succeeded    i shall sleep under the straw-stack tonight woot decided after he had eaten some of the vegetables from the garden and in fact he slept very well with the two tin men and the scarecrow sitting silently beside him and polychrome away somewhere in the moonlight dancing her fairy dances  at daybreak the tin woodman and the tin soldier took occasion to polish their bodies and oil their joints for both were exceedingly careful of their personal appearance they had forgotten the quarrel due to their accidental bumping of one another in the invisible country and being now good friends the tin woodman polished the tin soldier's back for him and then the tin soldier polished the tin woodman's back  for breakfast the wanderer ate crisp lettuce and radishes and the rainbow's daughter who had now returned to her friends sipped the dewdrops that had formed on the petals of the wild-flowers  as they passed the little house to renew their journey woot called out   good-bye mr and mrs swyne  the window opened and the two pigs looked out  a pleasant journey said the professor  have you any children asked the scarecrow who was a great friend of children  we have nine answered the professor but they do not live with us for when they were tiny piglets the wizard of oz came here and offered to care for them and to educate them so we let him have our nine tiny piglets for he's a good wizard and can be relied upon to keep his promises  i know the nine tiny piglets said the tin woodman  so do i said the scarecrow they still live in the emerald city and the wizard takes good care of them and teaches them to do all sorts of tricks  did they ever grow up inquired mrs squealina swyne in an anxious voice  no answered the scarecrow like all other children in the land of oz they will always remain children and in the case of the tiny piglets that is a good thing because they would not be nearly so cute and cunning if they were bigger  but are they happy asked mrs swyne  everyone in the emerald city is happy said the tin woodman they can't help it  then the travelers said good-bye and climbed the side of the basin that was toward mount munch     polychrome's magic    chapter 21   on this morning which ought to be the last of this important journey our friends started away as bright and cheery as could be and woot whistled a merry tune so that polychrome could dance to the music  on reaching the top of the hill the plain spread out before them in all its beauty of blue grasses and wildflowers and mount munch seemed much nearer than it had the previous evening they trudged on at a brisk pace and by noon the mountain was so close that they could admire its appearance its slopes were partly clothed with pretty evergreens and its foot-hills were tufted with a slender waving bluegrass that had a tassel on the end of every blade and for the first time they perceived near the foot of the mountain a charming house not of great size but neatly painted and with many flowers surrounding it and vines climbing over the doors and windows  it was toward this solitary house that our travelers now directed their steps thinking to inquire of the people who lived there where nimmie amee might be found  there were no paths but the way was quite open and clear and they were drawing near to the dwelling when woot the wanderer who was then in the lead of the little party halted with such an abrupt jerk that he stumbled over backward and lay flat on his back in the meadow the scarecrow stopped to look at the boy  why did you do that he asked in surprise  woot sat up and gazed around him in amazement  i i don't know he replied  the two tin men arm in arm started to pass them when both halted and tumbled with a great clatter into a heap beside woot polychrome laughing at the absurd sight came dancing up and she also came to a sudden stop but managed to save herself from falling  everyone of them was much astonished and the scarecrow said with a puzzled look   i don't see anything  nor i said woot but something hit me just the same  some invisible person struck me a heavy blow declared the tin woodman struggling to separate himself from the tin soldier whose legs and arms were mixed with his own  i'm not sure it was a person said polychrome looking more grave than usual it seems to me that i merely ran into some hard substance which barred my way in order to make sure of this let me try another place  she ran back a way and then with much caution advanced in a different place but when she reached a position on a line with the others she halted her arms outstretched before her    i can feel something hard something smooth as glass she said but i'm sure it is not glass  let me try suggested woot getting up but when he tried to go forward he discovered the same barrier that polychrome had encountered  no he said it isn't glass but what is it  air replied a small voice beside him solid air that's all  they all looked downward and found a sky-blue rabbit had stuck his head out of a burrow in the ground the rabbit's eyes were a deeper blue than his fur and the pretty creature seemed friendly and unafraid  air exclaimed woot staring in astonishment into the rabbit's blue eyes whoever heard of air so solid that one cannot push it aside  you can't push this air aside declared the rabbit for it was made hard by powerful sorcery and it forms a wall that is intended to keep people from getting to that house yonder  oh it's a wall is it said the tin woodman  yes it is really a wall answered the rabbit and it is fully six feet thick  how high is it inquired captain fyter the tin soldier  oh ever so high perhaps a mile said the rabbit  couldn't we go around it asked woot  of course for the wall is a circle explained the rabbit in the center of the circle stands the house so you may walk around the wall of solid air but you can't get to the house  who put the air wall around the house was the scarecrow's question  nimmie amee did that  nimmie amee they all exclaimed in surprise  yes answered the rabbit she used to live with an old witch who was suddenly destroyed and when nimmie amee ran away from the witch's house she took with her just one magic formula pure sorcery it was which enabled her to build this air wall around her house the house yonder it was quite a clever idea i think for it doesn't mar the beauty of the landscape solid air being invisible and yet it keeps all strangers away from the house  does nimmie amee live there now asked the tin woodman anxiously  yes indeed said the rabbit  and does she weep and wail from morning till night continued the emperor  no she seems quite happy asserted the rabbit  the tin woodman seemed quite disappointed to hear this report of his old sweetheart but the scarecrow reassured his friend saying     never mind your majesty however happy nimmie amee is now i'm sure she will be much happier as empress of the winkies  perhaps said captain fyter somewhat stiffly she will be still more happy to become the bride of a tin soldier  she shall choose between us as we have agreed the tin woodman promised but how shall we get to the poor girl  polychrome although dancing lightly back and forth had listened to every word of the conversation now she came forward and sat herself down just in front of the blue rabbit her many-hued draperies giving her the appearance of some beautiful flower the rabbit didn't back away an inch instead he gazed at the rainbow's daughter admiringly  does your burrow go underneath this wall of air asked polychrome  to be sure answered the blue rabbit i dug it that way so i could roam in these broad fields by going out one way or eat the cabbages in nimmie amee's garden by leaving my burrow at the other end i don't think nimmie amee ought to mind the little i take from her garden or the hole i've made under her magic wall a rabbit may go and come as he pleases but no one who is bigger than i am could get through my burrow  will you allow us to pass through it if we are able to inquired polychrome  yes indeed answered the blue rabbit i'm no especial friend of nimmie amee for once she threw stones at me just because i was nibbling some lettuce and only yesterday she yelled 'shoo' at me which made me nervous you're welcome to use my burrow in any way you choose  but this is all nonsense declared woot the wanderer we are every one too big to crawl through a rabbit's burrow  we are too big now agreed the scarecrow but you must remember that polychrome is a fairy and fairies have many magic powers  woot's face brightened as he turned to the lovely daughter of the rainbow  could you make us all as small as that rabbit he asked eagerly  i can try answered polychrome with a smile  and presently she did it so easily that woot was not the only one astonished as the now tiny people grouped themselves before the rabbit's burrow the hole appeared to them like the entrance to a tunnel which indeed it was  i'll go first said wee polychrome who had made herself grow as small as the others and into the tunnel she danced without hesitation a tiny scarecrow went next and then the two funny little tin men  walk in it's your turn said the blue rabbit to woot the wanderer i'm coming after to see how you get along this will be a regular surprise party to nimmie amee  so woot entered the hole and felt his way along its smooth sides in the dark until he finally saw the glimmer of daylight ahead and knew the journey was almost over had he remained his natural size the distance could have been covered in a few steps but to a thumb-high woot it was quite a promenade when he emerged from the burrow he found himself but a short distance from the house in the center of the vegetable garden where the leaves of rhubarb waving above his head seemed like trees outside the hole and waiting for him he found all his friends  so far so good remarked the scarecrow cheerfully  yes so far but no farther returned the tin woodman in a plaintive and disturbed tone of voice i am now close to nimmie amee whom i have come ever so far to seek but i cannot ask the girl to marry such a little man as i am now  i'm no bigger than a toy soldier said captain fyter sorrowfully unless polychrome can make us big again there is little use in our visiting nimmie amee at all for i'm sure she wouldn't care for a husband she might carelessly step on and ruin  polychrome laughed merrily  if i make you big you can't get out of here again said she and if you remain little nimmie amee will laugh at you so make your choice  i think we'd better go back said woot seriously  no said the tin woodman stoutly i have decided that it's my duty to make nimmie amee happy in case she wishes to marry me  so have i announced captain fyter a good soldier never shrinks from doing his duty  as for that said the scarecrow tin doesn't shrink any to speak of under any circumstances but woot and i intend to stick to our comrades whatever they decide to do so we will ask polychrome to make us as big as we were before  polychrome agreed to this request and in half a minute all of them including herself had been enlarged again to their natural sizes they then thanked the blue rabbit for his kind assistance and at once approached the house of nimmie amee     nimmie amee    chapter 22   we may be sure that at this moment our friends were all anxious to see the end of the adventure that had caused them so many trials and troubles perhaps the tin woodman's heart did not beat any faster because it was made of red velvet and stuffed with sawdust and the tin soldier's heart was made of tin and reposed in his tin bosom without a hint of emotion however there is little doubt that they both knew that a critical moment in their lives had arrived and that nimmie amee's decision was destined to influence the future of one or the other  as they assumed their natural sizes and the rhubarb leaves that had before towered above their heads now barely covered their feet they looked around the garden and found that no person was visible save themselves no sound of activity came from the house either but they walked to the front door which had a little porch built before it and there the two tinmen stood side by side while both knocked upon the door with their tin knuckles  as no one seemed eager to answer the summons they knocked again and then again finally they heard a stir from within and someone coughed  who's there called a girl's voice  it's i cried the tin twins together  how did you get there asked the voice  they hesitated how to reply so woot answered for them   by means of magic  oh said the unseen girl are you friends or foes  friends they all exclaimed  then they heard footsteps approach the door which slowly opened and revealed a very pretty munchkin girl standing in the doorway  nimmie amee cried the tin twins  that's my name replied the girl looking at them in cold surprise but who can you be  don't you know me nimmie said the tin woodman i'm your old sweetheart nick chopper  don't you know me my dear said the tin soldier i'm your old sweetheart captain fyter  nimmie amee smiled at them both then she looked beyond them at the rest of the party and smiled again however she seemed more amused than pleased  come in she said leading the way inside even sweethearts are forgotten after a time but you and your friends are welcome  the room they now entered was cosy and comfortable being neatly furnished and well swept and dusted but they found someone there besides nimmie amee a man dressed in the attractive munchkin costume was lazily reclining in an easy chair and he sat up and turned his eyes on the visitors with a cold and indifferent stare that was almost insolent he did not even rise from his seat to greet the strangers but after glaring at them he looked away with a scowl as if they were of too little importance to interest him  the tin men returned this man's stare with interest but they did not look away from him because neither of them seemed able to take his eyes off this munchkin who was remarkable in having one tin arm quite like their own tin arms  seems to me said captain fyter in a voice that sounded harsh and indignant that you sir are a vile impostor  gently gently cautioned the scarecrow don't be rude to strangers captain  rude shouted the tin soldier now very much provoked why he's a scoundrel a thief the villain is wearing my own head  yes added the tin woodman and he's wearing my right arm i can recognize it by the two warts on the little finger  good gracious exclaimed woot then this must be the man whom old ku-klip patched together and named chopfyt  the man now turned toward them still scowling    yes that is my name he said in a voice like a growl and it is absurd for you tin creatures or for anyone else to claim my head or arm or any part of me for they are my personal property  you you're a nobody shouted captain fyter    you're just a mix-up declared the emperor  now now gentlemen interrupted nimmie amee i must ask you to be more respectful to poor chopfyt for being my guests it is not polite for you to insult my husband  your husband the tin twins exclaimed in dismay  yes said she i married chopfyt a long time ago because my other two sweethearts had deserted me  this reproof embarrassed both nick chopper and captain fyter they looked down shamefaced for a moment and then the tin woodman explained in an earnest voice   i rusted  so did i said the tin soldier  i could not know that of course asserted nimmie amee all i knew was that neither of you came to marry me as you had promised to do but men are not scarce in the land of oz after i came here to live i met mr chopfyt and he was the more interesting because he reminded me strongly of both of you as you were before you became tin he even had a tin arm and that reminded me of you the more  no wonder remarked the scarecrow  but listen nimmie amee said the astonished woot he really is both of them for he is made of their cast-off parts  oh you're quite wrong declared polychrome laughing for she was greatly enjoying the confusion of the others the tin men are still themselves as they will tell you and so chopfyt must be someone else  they looked at her bewildered for the facts in the case were too puzzling to be grasped at once  it is all the fault of old ku-klip muttered the tin woodman he had no right to use our cast-off parts to make another man with  it seems he did it however said nimmie amee calmly and i married him because he resembled you both i won't say he is a husband to be proud of because he has a mixed nature and isn't always an agreeable companion there are times when i have to chide him gently both with my tongue and with my broomstick but he is my husband and i must make the best of him  if you don't like him suggested the tin woodman captain fyter and i can chop him up with our axe and sword and each take such parts of the fellow as belong to him then we are willing for you to select one of us as your husband  that is a good idea approved captain fyter drawing his sword  no said nimmie amee i think i'll keep the husband i now have he is now trained to draw the water and carry in the wood and hoe the cabbages and weed the flower-beds and dust the furniture and perform many tasks of a like character a new husband would have to be scolded and gently chided until he learns my ways so i think it will be better to keep my chopfyt and i see no reason why you should object to him you two gentlemen threw him away when you became tin because you had no further use for him so you cannot justly claim him now i advise you to go back to your own homes and forget me as i have forgotten you  good advice laughed polychrome dancing  are you happy asked the tin soldier  of course i am said nimmie amee i'm the mistress of all i survey the queen of my little domain  wouldn't you like to be the empress of the winkies asked the tin woodman  mercy no she answered that would be a lot of bother i don't care for society or pomp or posing all i ask is to be left alone and not to be annoyed by visitors  the scarecrow nudged woot the wanderer  that sounds to me like a hint he said  looks as if we'd had our journey for nothing remarked woot who was a little ashamed and disappointed because he had proposed the journey  i am glad however said the tin woodman that i have found nimmie amee and discovered that she is already married and happy it will relieve me of any further anxiety concerning her  for my part said the tin soldier i am not sorry to be free the only thing that really annoys me is finding my head upon chopfyt's body  as for that i'm pretty sure it is my body or a part of it anyway remarked the emperor of the winkies but never mind friend soldier let us be willing to donate our cast-off members to insure the happiness of nimmie amee and be thankful it is not our fate to hoe cabbages and draw water and be chided in the place of this creature chopfyt  yes agreed the soldier we have much to be thankful for  polychrome who had wandered outside now poked her pretty head through an open window and exclaimed in a pleased voice   it's getting cloudy perhaps it is going to rain     through the tunnel    chapter 23   it didn't rain just then although the clouds in the sky grew thicker and more threatening polychrome hoped for a thunder-storm followed by her rainbow but the two tin men did not relish the idea of getting wet they even preferred to remain in nimmie amee's house although they felt they were not welcome there rather than go out and face the coming storm but the scarecrow who was a very thoughtful person said to his friends   if we remain here until after the storm and polychrome goes away on her rainbow then we will be prisoners inside the wall of solid air so it seems best to start upon our return journey at once if i get wet my straw stuffing will be ruined and if you two tin gentlemen get wet you may perhaps rust again and become useless but even that is better than to stay here once we are free of the barrier we have woot the wanderer to help us and he can oil your joints and restuff my body if it becomes necessary for the boy is made of meat which neither rusts nor gets soggy or moldy  come along then cried polychrome from the window and the others realizing the wisdom of the scarecrow's speech took leave of nimmie amee who was glad to be rid of them and said good-bye to her husband who merely scowled and made no answer and then they hurried from the house  your old parts are not very polite i must say remarked the scarecrow when they were in the garden  no said woot chopfyt is a regular grouch he might have wished us a pleasant journey at the very least  i beg you not to hold us responsible for that creature's actions pleaded the tin woodman we are through with chopfyt and shall have nothing further to do with him  polychrome danced ahead of the party and led them straight to the burrow of the blue rabbit which they might have had some difficulty in finding without her there she lost no time in making them all small again the blue rabbit was busy nibbling cabbage leaves in nimmie amee's garden so they did not ask his permission but at once entered the burrow  even now the raindrops were beginning to fall but it was quite dry inside the tunnel and by the time they had reached the other end outside the circular wall of solid air the storm was at its height and the rain was coming down in torrents  let us wait here proposed polychrome peering out of the hole and then quickly retreating the rainbow won't appear until after the storm and i can make you big again in a jiffy before i join my sisters on our bow  that's a good plan said the scarecrow approvingly it will save me from getting soaked and soggy  it will save me from rusting said the tin soldier  it will enable me to remain highly polished said the tin woodman  oh as for that i myself prefer not to get my pretty clothes wet laughed the rainbow's daughter but while we wait i will bid you all adieu i must also thank you for saving me from that dreadful giantess mrs yoop you have been good and patient comrades and i have enjoyed our adventures together but i am never so happy as when on my dear rainbow  will your father scold you for getting left on the earth asked woot  i suppose so said polychrome gaily i'm always getting scolded for my mad pranks as they are called my sisters are so sweet and lovely and proper that they never dance off our rainbow and so they never have any adventures adventures to me are good fun only i never like to stay too long on earth because i really don't belong here i shall tell my father the rainbow that i'll try not to be so careless again and he will forgive me because in our sky mansions there is always joy and happiness  they were indeed sorry to part with their dainty and beautiful companion and assured her of their devotion if they ever chanced to meet again she shook hands with the scarecrow and the tin men and kissed woot the wanderer lightly upon his forehead  and then the rain suddenly ceased and as the tiny people left the burrow of the blue rabbit a glorious big rainbow appeared in the sky and the end of its arch slowly descended and touched the ground just where they stood  woot was so busy watching a score of lovely maidens sisters of polychrome who were leaning over the edge of the bow and another score who danced gaily amid the radiance of the splendid hues that he did not notice he was growing big again but now polychrome joined her sisters on the rainbow and the huge arch lifted and slowly melted away as the sun burst from the clouds and sent its own white beams dancing over the meadows  why she's gone exclaimed the boy and turned to see his companions still waving their hands in token of adieu to the vanished polychrome       the curtain falls    chapter 24   well the rest of the story is quickly told for the return journey of our adventurers was without any important incident the scarecrow was so afraid of meeting the hip-po-gy-raf and having his straw eaten again that he urged his comrades to select another route to the emerald city and they willingly consented so that the invisible country was wholly avoided  of course when they reached the emerald city their first duty was to visit ozma's palace where they were royally entertained the tin soldier and woot the wanderer were welcomed as warmly as any strangers might be who had been the traveling companions of ozma's dear old friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman  at the banquet table that evening they related the manner in which they had discovered nimmie amee and told how they had found her happily married to chopfyt whose relationship to nick chopper and captain fyter was so bewildering that they asked ozma's advice what to do about it  you need not consider chopfyt at all replied the beautiful girl ruler of oz if nimmie amee is content with that misfit man for a husband we have not even just cause to blame ku-klip for gluing him together  i think it was a very good idea added little dorothy for if ku-klip hadn't used up your cast-off parts they would have been wasted it's wicked to be wasteful isn't it  well anyhow said woot the wanderer chopfyt being kept a prisoner by his wife is too far away from anyone to bother either of you tin men in any way if you hadn't gone where he is and discovered him you would never have worried about him  what do you care anyhow betsy bobbin asked the tin woodman so long as nimmie amee is satisfied  and just to think remarked tiny trot that any girl would rather live with a mixture like chopfyt on far-away mount munch than to be the empress of the winkies  it is her own choice said the tin woodman contentedly and after all i'm not sure the winkies would care to have an empress  it puzzled ozma for a time to decide what to do with the tin soldier if he went with the tin woodman to the emperor's castle she felt that the two tin men might not be able to live together in harmony and moreover the emperor would not be so distinguished if he had a double constantly beside him so she asked captain fyter if he was willing to serve her as a soldier and he promptly declared that nothing would please him more after he had been in her service for some time ozma sent him into the gillikin country with instructions to keep order among the wild people who inhabit some parts of that unknown country of oz  as for woot being a wanderer by profession he was allowed to wander wherever he desired and ozma promised to keep watch over his future journeys and to protect the boy as well as she was able in case he ever got into more trouble  all this having been happily arranged the tin woodman returned to his tin castle and his chosen comrade the scarecrow accompanied him on the way the two friends were sure to pass many pleasant hours together in talking over their recent adventures for as they neither ate nor slept they found their greatest amusement in conversation "@"The Tin Woodman of Oz"@"L.Frank Baum"

    introduction   folklore legends myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic marvelous and manifestly unreal the winged fairies of grimm and andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations  yet the old time fairy tale having served for generations may now be classed as historical in the children’s library for the time has come for a series of newer wonder tales in which the stereotyped genie dwarf and fairy are eliminated together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale modern education includes morality therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident  having this thought in mind the story of the wonderful wizard of oz was written solely to please children of today it aspires to being a modernized fairy tale in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out  l frank baum chicago april 1900    the wonderful wizard of oz     chapter i the cyclone   dorothy lived in the midst of the great kansas prairies with uncle henry who was a farmer and aunt em who was the farmer’s wife their house was small for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles there were four walls a floor and a roof which made one room and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove a cupboard for the dishes a table three or four chairs and the beds uncle henry and aunt em had a big bed in one corner and dorothy a little bed in another corner there was no garret at all and no cellar—except a small hole dug in the ground called a cyclone cellar where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose mighty enough to crush any building in its path it was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole  when dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions the sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass with little cracks running through it even the grass was not green for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere once the house had been painted but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else  when aunt em came there to live she was a young pretty wife the sun and wind had changed her too they had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips and they were gray also she was thin and gaunt and never smiled now when dorothy who was an orphan first came to her aunt em had been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever dorothy’s merry voice reached her ears and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at  uncle henry never laughed he worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was he was gray also from his long beard to his rough boots and he looked stern and solemn and rarely spoke  it was toto that made dorothy laugh and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings toto was not gray he was a little black dog with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny wee nose toto played all day long and dorothy played with him and loved him dearly  today however they were not playing uncle henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky which was even grayer than usual dorothy stood in the door with toto in her arms and looked at the sky too aunt em was washing the dishes  from the far north they heard a low wail of the wind and uncle henry and dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm there now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also  suddenly uncle henry stood up  there’s a cyclone coming em he called to his wife i’ll go look after the stock then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept  aunt em dropped her work and came to the door one glance told her of the danger close at hand  quick dorothy she screamed run for the cellar  toto jumped out of dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed and the girl started to get him aunt em badly frightened threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small dark hole dorothy caught toto at last and started to follow her aunt when she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor  then a strange thing happened  the house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon  the north and south winds met where the house stood and made it the exact center of the cyclone in the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher until it was at the very top of the cyclone and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather  it was very dark and the wind howled horribly around her but dorothy found she was riding quite easily after the first few whirls around and one other time when the house tipped badly she felt as if she were being rocked gently like a baby in a cradle  toto did not like it he ran about the room now here now there barking loudly but dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen  once toto got too near the open trap door and fell in and at first the little girl thought she had lost him but soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall she crept to the hole caught toto by the ear and dragged him into the room again afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen  hour after hour passed away and slowly dorothy got over her fright but she felt quite lonely and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf at first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring at last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed and lay down upon it and toto followed and lay down beside her  in spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep     chapter ii the council with the munchkins   she was awakened by a shock so sudden and severe that if dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt as it was the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened and toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving nor was it dark for the bright sunshine came in at the window flooding the little room she sprang from her bed and with toto at her heels ran and opened the door  the little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw  the cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty there were lovely patches of greensward all about with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes a little way off was a small brook rushing and sparkling along between green banks and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry gray prairies  while she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen they were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to but neither were they very small in fact they seemed about as tall as dorothy who was a well-grown child for her age although they were so far as looks go many years older  three were men and one a woman and all were oddly dressed they wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved the hats of the men were blue the little woman’s hat was white and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds the men were dressed in blue of the same shade as their hats and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops the men dorothy thought were about as old as uncle henry for two of them had beards but the little woman was doubtless much older her face was covered with wrinkles her hair was nearly white and she walked rather stiffly  when these people drew near the house where dorothy was standing in the doorway they paused and whispered among themselves as if afraid to come farther but the little old woman walked up to dorothy made a low bow and said in a sweet voice   you are welcome most noble sorceress to the land of the munchkins we are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked witch of the east and for setting our people free from bondage  dorothy listened to this speech with wonder what could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress and saying she had killed the wicked witch of the east dorothy was an innocent harmless little girl who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home and she had never killed anything in all her life  but the little woman evidently expected her to answer so dorothy said with hesitation you are very kind but there must be some mistake i have not killed anything  your house did anyway replied the little old woman with a laugh and that is the same thing see she continued pointing to the corner of the house there are her two feet still sticking out from under a block of wood  dorothy looked and gave a little cry of fright there indeed just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on two feet were sticking out shod in silver shoes with pointed toes  oh dear oh dear cried dorothy clasping her hands together in dismay the house must have fallen on her whatever shall we do  there is nothing to be done said the little woman calmly  but who was she asked dorothy  she was the wicked witch of the east as i said answered the little woman she has held all the munchkins in bondage for many years making them slave for her night and day now they are all set free and are grateful to you for the favor  who are the munchkins inquired dorothy  they are the people who live in this land of the east where the wicked witch ruled  are you a munchkin asked dorothy  no but i am their friend although i live in the land of the north when they saw the witch of the east was dead the munchkins sent a swift messenger to me and i came at once i am the witch of the north  oh gracious cried dorothy are you a real witch  yes indeed answered the little woman but i am a good witch and the people love me i am not as powerful as the wicked witch was who ruled here or i should have set the people free myself  but i thought all witches were wicked said the girl who was half frightened at facing a real witch  oh no that is a great mistake there were only four witches in all the land of oz and two of them those who live in the north and the south are good witches i know this is true for i am one of them myself and cannot be mistaken those who dwelt in the east and the west were indeed wicked witches but now that you have killed one of them there is but one wicked witch in all the land of oz—the one who lives in the west  but said dorothy after a moment’s thought aunt em has told me that the witches were all dead—years and years ago  who is aunt em inquired the little old woman  she is my aunt who lives in kansas where i came from  the witch of the north seemed to think for a time with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground then she looked up and said i do not know where kansas is for i have never heard that country mentioned before but tell me is it a civilized country  oh yes replied dorothy  then that accounts for it in the civilized countries i believe there are no witches left nor wizards nor sorceresses nor magicians but you see the land of oz has never been civilized for we are cut off from all the rest of the world therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us  who are the wizards asked dorothy  oz himself is the great wizard answered the witch sinking her voice to a whisper he is more powerful than all the rest of us together he lives in the city of emeralds  dorothy was going to ask another question but just then the munchkins who had been standing silently by gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the wicked witch had been lying  what is it asked the little old woman and looked and began to laugh the feet of the dead witch had disappeared entirely and nothing was left but the silver shoes  she was so old explained the witch of the north that she dried up quickly in the sun that is the end of her but the silver shoes are yours and you shall have them to wear she reached down and picked up the shoes and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to dorothy  the witch of the east was proud of those silver shoes said one of the munchkins and there is some charm connected with them but what it is we never knew  dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table then she came out again to the munchkins and said   i am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle for i am sure they will worry about me can you help me find my way  the munchkins and the witch first looked at one another and then at dorothy and then shook their heads  at the east not far from here said one there is a great desert and none could live to cross it  it is the same at the south said another for i have been there and seen it the south is the country of the quadlings  i am told said the third man that it is the same at the west and that country where the winkies live is ruled by the wicked witch of the west who would make you her slave if you passed her way  the north is my home said the old lady and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this land of oz i’m afraid my dear you will have to live with us  dorothy began to sob at this for she felt lonely among all these strange people her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted munchkins for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also as for the little old woman she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose while she counted one two three in a solemn voice at once the cap changed to a slate on which was written in big white chalk marks   let dorothy go to the city of emeralds   the little old woman took the slate from her nose and having read the words on it asked is your name dorothy my dear  yes answered the child looking up and drying her tears  then you must go to the city of emeralds perhaps oz will help you  where is this city asked dorothy  it is exactly in the center of the country and is ruled by oz the great wizard i told you of  is he a good man inquired the girl anxiously  he is a good wizard whether he is a man or not i cannot tell for i have never seen him  how can i get there asked dorothy  you must walk it is a long journey through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible however i will use all the magic arts i know of to keep you from harm  won’t you go with me pleaded the girl who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend  no i cannot do that she replied but i will give you my kiss and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the witch of the north  she came close to dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead where her lips touched the girl they left a round shining mark as dorothy found out soon after  the road to the city of emeralds is paved with yellow brick said the witch so you cannot miss it when you get to oz do not be afraid of him but tell your story and ask him to help you good-bye my dear  the three munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey after which they walked away through the trees the witch gave dorothy a friendly little nod whirled around on her left heel three times and straightway disappeared much to the surprise of little toto who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by  but dorothy knowing her to be a witch had expected her to disappear in just that way and was not surprised in the least     chapter iii how dorothy saved the scarecrow   when dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry so she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread which she spread with butter she gave some to toto and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear sparkling water toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there dorothy went to get him and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast  then she went back to the house and having helped herself and toto to a good drink of the cool clear water she set about making ready for the journey to the city of emeralds  dorothy had only one other dress but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed it was gingham with checks of white and blue and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings it was still a pretty frock the girl washed herself carefully dressed herself in the clean gingham and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head she took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard laying a white cloth over the top then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were  they surely will never do for a long journey toto she said and toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant  at that moment dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the witch of the east  i wonder if they will fit me she said to toto they would be just the thing to take a long walk in for they could not wear out  she took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her  finally she picked up her basket  come along toto she said we will go to the emerald city and ask the great oz how to get back to kansas again  she closed the door locked it and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress and so with toto trotting along soberly behind her she started on her journey  there were several roads nearby but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks within a short time she was walking briskly toward the emerald city her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard yellow road-bed the sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly and dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land  she was surprised as she walked along to see how pretty the country was about her there were neat fences at the sides of the road painted a dainty blue color and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance evidently the munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops once in a while she would pass a house and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the wicked witch and setting them free from bondage the houses of the munchkins were odd-looking dwellings for each was round with a big dome for a roof all were painted blue for in this country of the east blue was the favorite color  toward evening when dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night she came to a house rather larger than the rest on the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts pies and cakes and many other good things to eat  the people greeted dorothy kindly and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them for this was the home of one of the richest munchkins in the land and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch  dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich munchkin himself whose name was boq then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance  when boq saw her silver shoes he said you must be a great sorceress  why asked the girl  because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch besides you have white in your frock and only witches and sorceresses wear white  my dress is blue and white checked said dorothy smoothing out the wrinkles in it  it is kind of you to wear that said boq blue is the color of the munchkins and white is the witch color so we know you are a friendly witch  dorothy did not know what to say to this for all the people seemed to think her a witch and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land  when she had tired watching the dancing boq led her into the house where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it the sheets were made of blue cloth and dorothy slept soundly in them till morning with toto curled up on the blue rug beside her  she ate a hearty breakfast and watched a wee munchkin baby who played with toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused dorothy toto was a fine curiosity to all the people for they had never seen a dog before  how far is it to the emerald city the girl asked  i do not know answered boq gravely for i have never been there it is better for people to keep away from oz unless they have business with him but it is a long way to the emerald city and it will take you many days the country here is rich and pleasant but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey  this worried dorothy a little but she knew that only the great oz could help her get to kansas again so she bravely resolved not to turn back  she bade her friends good-bye and again started along the road of yellow brick when she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down there was a great cornfield beyond the fence and not far away she saw a scarecrow placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn  dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the scarecrow its head was a small sack stuffed with straw with eyes nose and mouth painted on it to represent a face an old pointed blue hat that had belonged to some munchkin was perched on his head and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes worn and faded which had also been stuffed with straw on the feet were some old boots with blue tops such as every man wore in this country and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back  while dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer painted face of the scarecrow she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her she thought she must have been mistaken at first for none of the scarecrows in kansas ever wink but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it while toto ran around the pole and barked  good day said the scarecrow in a rather husky voice  did you speak asked the girl in wonder  certainly answered the scarecrow how do you do  i’m pretty well thank you replied dorothy politely how do you do  i’m not feeling well said the scarecrow with a smile for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows  can’t you get down asked dorothy  no for this pole is stuck up my back if you will please take away the pole i shall be greatly obliged to you  dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole for being stuffed with straw it was quite light  thank you very much said the scarecrow when he had been set down on the ground i feel like a new man  dorothy was puzzled at this for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak and to see him bow and walk along beside her  who are you asked the scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned and where are you going  my name is dorothy said the girl and i am going to the emerald city to ask the great oz to send me back to kansas  where is the emerald city he inquired and who is oz  why don’t you know she returned in surprise  no indeed i don’t know anything you see i am stuffed so i have no brains at all he answered sadly  oh said dorothy i’m awfully sorry for you  do you think he asked if i go to the emerald city with you that oz would give me some brains  i cannot tell she returned but you may come with me if you like if oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now  that is true said the scarecrow you see he continued confidentially i don’t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed because i cannot get hurt if anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me it doesn’t matter for i can’t feel it but i do not want people to call me a fool and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains as yours is how am i ever to know anything  i understand how you feel said the little girl who was truly sorry for him if you will come with me i’ll ask oz to do all he can for you  thank you he answered gratefully  they walked back to the road dorothy helped him over the fence and they started along the path of yellow brick for the emerald city  toto did not like this addition to the party at first he smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the scarecrow  don’t mind toto said dorothy to her new friend he never bites  oh i’m not afraid replied the scarecrow he can’t hurt the straw do let me carry that basket for you i shall not mind it for i can’t get tired i’ll tell you a secret he continued as he walked along there is only one thing in the world i am afraid of  what is that asked dorothy the munchkin farmer who made you  no answered the scarecrow it’s a lighted match     chapter iv the road through the forest   after a few hours the road began to be rough and the walking grew so difficult that the scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks which were here very uneven sometimes indeed they were broken or missing altogether leaving holes that toto jumped across and dorothy walked around as for the scarecrow having no brains he walked straight ahead and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks it never hurt him however and dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap  the farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back there were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became  at noon they sat down by the roadside near a little brook and dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread she offered a piece to the scarecrow but he refused  i am never hungry he said and it is a lucky thing i am not for my mouth is only painted and if i should cut a hole in it so i could eat the straw i am stuffed with would come out and that would spoil the shape of my head  dorothy saw at once that this was true so she only nodded and went on eating her bread  tell me something about yourself and the country you came from said the scarecrow when she had finished her dinner so she told him all about kansas and how gray everything was there and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer land of oz  the scarecrow listened carefully and said i cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry gray place you call kansas  that is because you have no brains answered the girl no matter how dreary and gray our homes are we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country be it ever so beautiful there is no place like home  the scarecrow sighed  of course i cannot understand it he said if your heads were stuffed with straw like mine you would probably all live in the beautiful places and then kansas would have no people at all it is fortunate for kansas that you have brains  won’t you tell me a story while we are resting asked the child  the scarecrow looked at her reproachfully and answered   my life has been so short that i really know nothing whatever i was only made day before yesterday what happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me luckily when the farmer made my head one of the first things he did was to paint my ears so that i heard what was going on there was another munchkin with him and the first thing i heard was the farmer saying ‘how do you like those ears’  ‘they aren’t straight’ answered the other  ‘never mind’ said the farmer ‘they are ears just the same’ which was true enough  ‘now i’ll make the eyes’ said the farmer so he painted my right eye and as soon as it was finished i found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity for this was my first glimpse of the world  ‘that’s a rather pretty eye’ remarked the munchkin who was watching the farmer ‘blue paint is just the color for eyes’  ‘i think i’ll make the other a little bigger’ said the farmer and when the second eye was done i could see much better than before then he made my nose and my mouth but i did not speak because at that time i didn’t know what a mouth was for i had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs and when they fastened on my head at last i felt very proud for i thought i was just as good a man as anyone  ‘this fellow will scare the crows fast enough’ said the farmer ‘he looks just like a man’  ‘why he is a man’ said the other and i quite agreed with him the farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield and set me up on a tall stick where you found me he and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone  i did not like to be deserted this way so i tried to walk after them but my feet would not touch the ground and i was forced to stay on that pole it was a lonely life to lead for i had nothing to think of having been made such a little while before many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield but as soon as they saw me they flew away again thinking i was a munchkin and this pleased me and made me feel that i was quite an important person by and by an old crow flew near me and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said   ‘i wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw’ then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted the other birds seeing he was not harmed by me came to eat the corn too so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me  i felt sad at this for it showed i was not such a good scarecrow after all but the old crow comforted me saying ‘if you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them and a better man than some of them brains are the only things worth having in this world no matter whether one is a crow or a man’  after the crows had gone i thought this over and decided i would try hard to get some brains by good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake and from what you say i am sure the great oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the emerald city  i hope so said dorothy earnestly since you seem anxious to have them  oh yes i am anxious returned the scarecrow it is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool  well said the girl let us go and she handed the basket to the scarecrow  there were no fences at all by the roadside now and the land was rough and untilled toward evening they came to a great forest where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick it was almost dark under the trees for the branches shut out the daylight but the travelers did not stop and went on into the forest  if this road goes in it must come out said the scarecrow and as the emerald city is at the other end of the road we must go wherever it leads us  anyone would know that said dorothy  certainly that is why i know it returned the scarecrow if it required brains to figure it out i never should have said it  after an hour or so the light faded away and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness dorothy could not see at all but toto could for some dogs see very well in the dark and the scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day so she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well  if you see any house or any place where we can pass the night she said you must tell me for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark  soon after the scarecrow stopped  i see a little cottage at the right of us he said built of logs and branches shall we go there  yes indeed answered the child i am all tired out  so the scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage and dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner she lay down at once and with toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep the scarecrow who was never tired stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came     chapter v the rescue of the tin woodman   when dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels she sat up and looked around her there was the scarecrow still standing patiently in his corner waiting for her  we must go and search for water she said to him  why do you want water he asked  to wash my face clean after the dust of the road and to drink so the dry bread will not stick in my throat  it must be inconvenient to be made of flesh said the scarecrow thoughtfully for you must sleep and eat and drink however you have brains and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly  they left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water where dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast she saw there was not much bread left in the basket and the girl was thankful the scarecrow did not have to eat anything for there was scarcely enough for herself and toto for the day  when she had finished her meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick she was startled to hear a deep groan near by  what was that she asked timidly  i cannot imagine replied the scarecrow but we can go and see  just then another groan reached their ears and the sound seemed to come from behind them they turned and walked through the forest a few steps when dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees she ran to the place and then stopped short with a little cry of surprise  one of the big trees had been partly chopped through and standing beside it with an uplifted axe in his hands was a man made entirely of tin his head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body but he stood perfectly motionless as if he could not stir at all  dorothy looked at him in amazement and so did the scarecrow while toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs which hurt his teeth  did you groan asked dorothy  yes answered the tin man i did i’ve been groaning for more than a year and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me  what can i do for you she inquired softly for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke  get an oil-can and oil my joints he answered they are rusted so badly that i cannot move them at all if i am well oiled i shall soon be all right again you will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage  dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can and then she returned and asked anxiously where are your joints  oil my neck first replied the tin woodman so she oiled it and as it was quite badly rusted the scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely and then the man could turn it himself  now oil the joints in my arms he said and dorothy oiled them and the scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new  the tin woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe which he leaned against the tree  this is a great comfort he said i have been holding that axe in the air ever since i rusted and i’m glad to be able to put it down at last now if you will oil the joints of my legs i shall be all right once more  so they oiled his legs until he could move them freely and he thanked them again and again for his release for he seemed a very polite creature and very grateful  i might have stood there always if you had not come along he said so you have certainly saved my life how did you happen to be here  we are on our way to the emerald city to see the great oz she answered and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night  why do you wish to see oz he asked  i want him to send me back to kansas and the scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head she replied  the tin woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment then he said   do you suppose oz could give me a heart  why i guess so dorothy answered it would be as easy as to give the scarecrow brains  true the tin woodman returned so if you will allow me to join your party i will also go to the emerald city and ask oz to help me  come along said the scarecrow heartily and dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company so the tin woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick  the tin woodman had asked dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket for he said if i should get caught in the rain and rust again i would need the oil-can badly  it was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass but the tin woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party  dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again  why didn’t you walk around the hole asked the tin woodman  i don’t know enough replied the scarecrow cheerfully my head is stuffed with straw you know and that is why i am going to oz to ask him for some brains  oh i see said the tin woodman but after all brains are not the best things in the world  have you any inquired the scarecrow  no my head is quite empty answered the woodman but once i had brains and a heart also so having tried them both i should much rather have a heart  and why is that asked the scarecrow  i will tell you my story and then you will know  so while they were walking through the forest the tin woodman told the following story   i was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living when i grew up i too became a wood-chopper and after my father died i took care of my old mother as long as she lived then i made up my mind that instead of living alone i would marry so that i might not become lonely  there was one of the munchkin girls who was so beautiful that i soon grew to love her with all my heart she on her part promised to marry me as soon as i could earn enough money to build a better house for her so i set to work harder than ever but the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework so the old woman went to the wicked witch of the east and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage thereupon the wicked witch enchanted my axe and when i was chopping away at my best one day for i was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg  this at first seemed a great misfortune for i knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper so i went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin the leg worked very well once i was used to it but my action angered the wicked witch of the east for she had promised the old woman i should not marry the pretty munchkin girl when i began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg again i went to the tinsmith and again he made me a leg out of tin after this the enchanted axe cut off my arms one after the other but nothing daunted i had them replaced with tin ones the wicked witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head and at first i thought that was the end of me but the tinsmith happened to come along and he made me a new head out of tin  i thought i had beaten the wicked witch then and i worked harder than ever but i little knew how cruel my enemy could be she thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful munchkin maiden and made my axe slip again so that it cut right through my body splitting me into two halves once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it by means of joints so that i could move around as well as ever but alas i had now no heart so that i lost all my love for the munchkin girl and did not care whether i married her or not i suppose she is still living with the old woman waiting for me to come after her  my body shone so brightly in the sun that i felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped for it could not cut me there was only one danger—that my joints would rust but i kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever i needed it however there came a day when i forgot to do this and being caught in a rainstorm before i thought of the danger my joints had rusted and i was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me it was a terrible thing to undergo but during the year i stood there i had time to think that the greatest loss i had known was the loss of my heart while i was in love i was the happiest man on earth but no one can love who has not a heart and so i am resolved to ask oz to give me one if he does i will go back to the munchkin maiden and marry her  both dorothy and the scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the tin woodman and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart  all the same said the scarecrow i shall ask for brains instead of a heart for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one  i shall take the heart returned the tin woodman for brains do not make one happy and happiness is the best thing in the world  dorothy did not say anything for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right and she decided if she could only get back to kansas and aunt em it did not matter so much whether the woodman had no brains and the scarecrow no heart or each got what he wanted  what worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone and another meal for herself and toto would empty the basket to be sure neither the woodman nor the scarecrow ever ate anything but she was not made of tin nor straw and could not live unless she was fed     chapter vi the cowardly lion   all this time dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods the road was still paved with yellow brick but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees and the walking was not at all good  there were few birds in this part of the forest for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine but now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees these sounds made the little girl’s heart beat fast for she did not know what made them but toto knew and he walked close to dorothy’s side and did not even bark in return  how long will it be the child asked of the tin woodman before we are out of the forest  i cannot tell was the answer for i have never been to the emerald city but my father went there once when i was a boy and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country although nearer to the city where oz dwells the country is beautiful but i am not afraid so long as i have my oil-can and nothing can hurt the scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good witch’s kiss and that will protect you from harm  but toto said the girl anxiously what will protect him  we must protect him ourselves if he is in danger replied the tin woodman  just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar and the next moment a great lion bounded into the road with one blow of his paw he sent the scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road and then he struck at the tin woodman with his sharp claws but to the lion’s surprise he could make no impression on the tin although the woodman fell over in the road and lay still  little toto now that he had an enemy to face ran barking toward the lion and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog when dorothy fearing toto would be killed and heedless of danger rushed forward and slapped the lion upon his nose as hard as she could while she cried out   don’t you dare to bite toto you ought to be ashamed of yourself a big beast like you to bite a poor little dog  i didn’t bite him said the lion as he rubbed his nose with his paw where dorothy had hit it  no but you tried to she retorted you are nothing but a big coward  i know it said the lion hanging his head in shame i’ve always known it but how can i help it  i don’t know i’m sure to think of your striking a stuffed man like the poor scarecrow  is he stuffed asked the lion in surprise as he watched her pick up the scarecrow and set him upon his feet while she patted him into shape again  of course he’s stuffed replied dorothy who was still angry  that’s why he went over so easily remarked the lion it astonished me to see him whirl around so is the other one stuffed also  no said dorothy he’s made of tin and she helped the woodman up again  that’s why he nearly blunted my claws said the lion when they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back what is that little animal you are so tender of  he is my dog toto answered dorothy  is he made of tin or stuffed asked the lion  neither he’s a—a—a meat dog said the girl  oh he’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small now that i look at him no one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me continued the lion sadly  what makes you a coward asked dorothy looking at the great beast in wonder for he was as big as a small horse  it’s a mystery replied the lion i suppose i was born that way all the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave for the lion is everywhere thought to be the king of beasts i learned that if i roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way whenever i’ve met a man i’ve been awfully scared but i just roared at him and he has always run away as fast as he could go if the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me i should have run myself—i’m such a coward but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me and of course i let them go  but that isn’t right the king of beasts shouldn’t be a coward said the scarecrow  i know it returned the lion wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail it is my great sorrow and makes my life very unhappy but whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast  perhaps you have heart disease said the tin woodman  it may be said the lion  if you have continued the tin woodman you ought to be glad for it proves you have a heart for my part i have no heart so i cannot have heart disease  perhaps said the lion thoughtfully if i had no heart i should not be a coward  have you brains asked the scarecrow  i suppose so i’ve never looked to see replied the lion  i am going to the great oz to ask him to give me some remarked the scarecrow for my head is stuffed with straw  and i am going to ask him to give me a heart said the woodman  and i am going to ask him to send toto and me back to kansas added dorothy  do you think oz could give me courage asked the cowardly lion  just as easily as he could give me brains said the scarecrow  or give me a heart said the tin woodman  or send me back to kansas said dorothy  then if you don’t mind i’ll go with you said the lion for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage  you will be very welcome answered dorothy for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts it seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily  they really are said the lion but that doesn’t make me any braver and as long as i know myself to be a coward i shall be unhappy  so once more the little company set off upon the journey the lion walking with stately strides at dorothy’s side toto did not approve of this new comrade at first for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the lion’s great jaws but after a time he became more at ease and presently toto and the cowardly lion had grown to be good friends  during the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey once indeed the tin woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road and killed the poor little thing this made the tin woodman very unhappy for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret these tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw and there they rusted when dorothy presently asked him a question the tin woodman could not open his mouth for his jaws were tightly rusted together he became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to dorothy to relieve him but she could not understand the lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong but the scarecrow seized the oil-can from dorothy’s basket and oiled the woodman’s jaws so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before  this will serve me a lesson said he to look where i step for if i should kill another bug or beetle i should surely cry again and crying rusts my jaws so that i cannot speak  thereafter he walked very carefully with his eyes on the road and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it so as not to harm it the tin woodman knew very well he had no heart and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything  you people with hearts he said have something to guide you and need never do wrong but i have no heart and so i must be very careful when oz gives me a heart of course i needn’t mind so much     chapter vii the journey to the great oz   they were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest for there were no houses near the tree made a good thick covering to protect them from the dew and the tin woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely she and toto ate the last of their bread and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast  if you wish said the lion i will go into the forest and kill a deer for you you can roast it by the fire since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food and then you will have a very good breakfast  don’t please don’t begged the tin woodman i should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer and then my jaws would rust again  but the lion went away into the forest and found his own supper and no one ever knew what it was for he didn’t mention it and the scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled dorothy’s basket with them so that she would not be hungry for a long time she thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the scarecrow but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts his padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket but the scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket for it enabled him to keep away from the fire as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up so he kept a good distance away from the flames and only came near to cover dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep these kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning  when it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook and soon after they all started toward the emerald city  this was to be an eventful day for the travelers they had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side it was a very wide ditch and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep and there were many big jagged rocks at the bottom the sides were so steep that none of them could climb down and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end  what shall we do asked dorothy despairingly  i haven’t the faintest idea said the tin woodman and the lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful  but the scarecrow said we cannot fly that is certain neither can we climb down into this great ditch therefore if we cannot jump over it we must stop where we are  i think i could jump over it said the cowardly lion after measuring the distance carefully in his mind  then we are all right answered the scarecrow for you can carry us all over on your back one at a time  well i’ll try it said the lion who will go first  i will declared the scarecrow for if you found that you could not jump over the gulf dorothy would be killed or the tin woodman badly dented on the rocks below but if i am on your back it will not matter so much for the fall would not hurt me at all  i am terribly afraid of falling myself said the cowardly lion but i suppose there is nothing to do but try it so get on my back and we will make the attempt  the scarecrow sat upon the lion’s back and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down  why don’t you run and jump asked the scarecrow  because that isn’t the way we lions do these things he replied then giving a great spring he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side they were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it and after the scarecrow had got down from his back the lion sprang across the ditch again  dorothy thought she would go next so she took toto in her arms and climbed on the lion’s back holding tightly to his mane with one hand the next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air and then before she had time to think about it she was safe on the other side the lion went back a third time and got the tin woodman and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest for his great leaps had made his breath short and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long  they found the forest very thick on this side and it looked dark and gloomy after the lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick silently wondering each in his own mind if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again to add to their discomfort they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest and the lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the kalidahs lived  what are the kalidahs asked the girl  they are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers replied the lion and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as i could kill toto i’m terribly afraid of the kalidahs  i’m not surprised that you are returned dorothy they must be dreadful beasts  the lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road but this one was so broad and deep that the lion knew at once he could not leap across it  so they sat down to consider what they should do and after serious thought the scarecrow said   here is a great tree standing close to the ditch if the tin woodman can chop it down so that it will fall to the other side we can walk across it easily  that is a first-rate idea said the lion one would almost suspect you had brains in your head instead of straw  the woodman set to work at once and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through then the lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch with its top branches on the other side  they had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers  they are the kalidahs said the cowardly lion beginning to tremble  quick cried the scarecrow let us cross over  so dorothy went first holding toto in her arms the tin woodman followed and the scarecrow came next the lion although he was certainly afraid turned to face the kalidahs and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that dorothy screamed and the scarecrow fell over backward while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise  but seeing they were bigger than the lion and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him the kalidahs again rushed forward and the lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree and the lion said to dorothy   we are lost for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws but stand close behind me and i will fight them as long as i am alive  wait a minute called the scarecrow he had been thinking what was best to be done and now he asked the woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch the tin woodman began to use his axe at once and just as the two kalidahs were nearly across the tree fell with a crash into the gulf carrying the ugly snarling brutes with it and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom  well said the cowardly lion drawing a long breath of relief i see we are going to live a little while longer and i am glad of it for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet  ah said the tin woodman sadly i wish i had a heart to beat  this adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest and they walked so fast that dorothy became tired and had to ride on the lion’s back to their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river flowing swiftly just before them on the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits they were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them  how shall we cross the river asked dorothy  that is easily done replied the scarecrow the tin woodman must build us a raft so we can float to the other side  so the woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft and while he was busy at this the scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit this pleased dorothy who had eaten nothing but nuts all day and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit  but it takes time to make a raft even when one is as industrious and untiring as the tin woodman and when night came the work was not done so they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning and dorothy dreamed of the emerald city and of the good wizard oz who would soon send her back to her own home again     chapter viii the deadly poppy field   our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope and dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through although they had suffered many discouragements but before them was a lovely sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the emerald city  to be sure the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land but the raft was nearly done and after the tin woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins they were ready to start dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held toto in her arms when the cowardly lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly for he was big and heavy but the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood upon the other end to steady it and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water  they got along quite well at first but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick and the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom  this is bad said the tin woodman for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the wicked witch of the west and she will enchant us and make us her slaves  and then i should get no brains said the scarecrow  and i should get no courage said the cowardly lion  and i should get no heart said the tin woodman  and i should never get back to kansas said dorothy  we must certainly get to the emerald city if we can the scarecrow continued and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river then before he could pull it out again—or let go—the raft was swept away and the poor scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river  good-bye he called after them and they were very sorry to leave him indeed the tin woodman began to cry but fortunately remembered that he might rust and so dried his tears on dorothy’s apron  of course this was a bad thing for the scarecrow  i am now worse off than when i first met dorothy he thought then i was stuck on a pole in a cornfield where i could make-believe scare the crows at any rate but surely there is no use for a scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river i am afraid i shall never have any brains after all  down the stream the raft floated and the poor scarecrow was left far behind then the lion said   something must be done to save us i think i can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail  so he sprang into the water and the tin woodman caught fast hold of his tail then the lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore it was hard work although he was so big but by and by they were drawn out of the current and then dorothy took the tin woodman’s long pole and helped push the raft to the land  they were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the emerald city  what shall we do now asked the tin woodman as the lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him  we must get back to the road in some way said dorothy  the best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again remarked the lion  so when they were rested dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank to the road from which the river had carried them it was a lovely country with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them and had they not felt so sorry for the poor scarecrow they could have been very happy  they walked along as fast as they could dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower and after a time the tin woodman cried out  look  then they all looked at the river and saw the scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water looking very lonely and sad  what can we do to save him asked dorothy  the lion and the woodman both shook their heads for they did not know so they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the scarecrow until a stork flew by who upon seeing them stopped to rest at the water’s edge  who are you and where are you going asked the stork  i am dorothy answered the girl and these are my friends the tin woodman and the cowardly lion and we are going to the emerald city  this isn’t the road said the stork as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party  i know it returned dorothy but we have lost the scarecrow and are wondering how we shall get him again  where is he asked the stork  over there in the river answered the little girl  if he wasn’t so big and heavy i would get him for you remarked the stork  he isn’t heavy a bit said dorothy eagerly for he is stuffed with straw and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much  well i’ll try said the stork but if i find he is too heavy to carry i shall have to drop him in the river again  so the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the scarecrow was perched upon his pole then the stork with her great claws grabbed the scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank where dorothy and the lion and the tin woodman and toto were sitting  when the scarecrow found himself among his friends again he was so happy that he hugged them all even the lion and toto and as they walked along he sang tol-de-ri-de-oh at every step he felt so gay  i was afraid i should have to stay in the river forever he said but the kind stork saved me and if i ever get any brains i shall find the stork again and do her some kindness in return  that’s all right said the stork who was flying along beside them i always like to help anyone in trouble but i must go now for my babies are waiting in the nest for me i hope you will find the emerald city and that oz will help you  thank you replied dorothy and then the kind stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight  they walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them there were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms besides great clusters of scarlet poppies which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled dorothy’s eyes  aren’t they beautiful the girl asked as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers  i suppose so answered the scarecrow when i have brains i shall probably like them better  if i only had a heart i should love them added the tin woodman  i always did like flowers said the lion they seem so helpless and frail but there are none in the forest so bright as these  they now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies and fewer and fewer of the other flowers and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever but dorothy did not know this nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep  but the tin woodman would not let her do this  we must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark he said and the scarecrow agreed with him so they kept walking until dorothy could stand no longer her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies fast asleep  what shall we do asked the tin woodman  if we leave her here she will die said the lion the smell of the flowers is killing us all i myself can scarcely keep my eyes open and the dog is asleep already  it was true toto had fallen down beside his little mistress but the scarecrow and the tin woodman not being made of flesh were not troubled by the scent of the flowers  run fast said the scarecrow to the lion and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can we will bring the little girl with us but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried  so the lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go in a moment he was out of sight  let us make a chair with our hands and carry her said the scarecrow so they picked up toto and put the dog in dorothy’s lap and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers  on and on they walked and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end they followed the bend of the river and at last came upon their friend the lion lying fast asleep among the poppies the flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them  we can do nothing for him said the tin woodman sadly for he is much too heavy to lift we must leave him here to sleep on forever and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last  i’m sorry said the scarecrow the lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly but let us go on  they carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her     chapter ix the queen of the field mice   we cannot be far from the road of yellow brick now remarked the scarecrow as he stood beside the girl for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away  the tin woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl and turning his head which worked beautifully on hinges he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them it was indeed a great yellow wildcat and the woodman thought it must be chasing something for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open showing two rows of ugly teeth while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire as it came nearer the tin woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty harmless creature  so the woodman raised his axe and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces  the field mouse now that it was freed from its enemy stopped short and coming slowly up to the woodman it said in a squeaky little voice   oh thank you thank you ever so much for saving my life  don’t speak of it i beg of you replied the woodman i have no heart you know so i am careful to help all those who may need a friend even if it happens to be only a mouse  only a mouse cried the little animal indignantly why i am a queen—the queen of all the field mice  oh indeed said the woodman making a bow  therefore you have done a great deed as well as a brave one in saving my life added the queen  at that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them and when they saw their queen they exclaimed   oh your majesty we thought you would be killed how did you manage to escape the great wildcat they all bowed so low to the little queen that they almost stood upon their heads  this funny tin man she answered killed the wildcat and saved my life so hereafter you must all serve him and obey his slightest wish  we will cried all the mice in a shrill chorus and then they scampered in all directions for toto had awakened from his sleep and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in kansas and he saw no harm in it  but the tin woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight while he called to the mice come back come back toto shall not hurt you  at this the queen of the mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked in a timid voice are you sure he will not bite us  i will not let him said the woodman so do not be afraid  one by one the mice came creeping back and toto did not bark again although he tried to get out of the woodman’s arms and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin finally one of the biggest mice spoke  is there anything we can do it asked to repay you for saving the life of our queen  nothing that i know of answered the woodman but the scarecrow who had been trying to think but could not because his head was stuffed with straw said quickly oh yes you can save our friend the cowardly lion who is asleep in the poppy bed  a lion cried the little queen why he would eat us all up  oh no declared the scarecrow this lion is a coward  really asked the mouse  he says so himself answered the scarecrow and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend if you will help us to save him i promise that he shall treat you all with kindness  very well said the queen we trust you but what shall we do  are there many of these mice which call you queen and are willing to obey you  oh yes there are thousands she replied  then send for them all to come here as soon as possible and let each one bring a long piece of string  the queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people as soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible  now said the scarecrow to the tin woodman you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the lion  so the woodman went at once to the trees and began to work and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches he fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk so fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them  they came from all directions and there were thousands of them  big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth it was about this time that dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes she was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly but the scarecrow told her about everything and turning to the dignified little mouse he said   permit me to introduce to you her majesty the queen  dorothy nodded gravely and the queen made a curtsy after which she became quite friendly with the little girl  the scarecrow and the woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck using the strings they had brought one end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily even the scarecrow and the tin woodman could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the lion lay asleep  after a great deal of hard work for the lion was heavy they managed to get him up on the truck then the queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep  at first the little creatures many though they were could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck but the woodman and the scarecrow both pushed from behind and they got along better soon they rolled the lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields where he could breathe the sweet fresh air again instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers  dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death she had grown so fond of the big lion she was glad he had been rescued  then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes the queen of the mice was the last to leave  if ever you need us again she said come out into the field and call and we shall hear you and come to your assistance good-bye  good-bye they all answered and away the queen ran while dorothy held toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her  after this they sat down beside the lion until he should awaken and the scarecrow brought dorothy some fruit from a tree near by which she ate for her dinner     chapter x the guardian of the gate   it was some time before the cowardly lion awakened for he had lain among the poppies a long while breathing in their deadly fragrance but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive  i ran as fast as i could he said sitting down and yawning but the flowers were too strong for me how did you get me out  then they told him of the field mice and how they had generously saved him from death and the cowardly lion laughed and said   i have always thought myself very big and terrible yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me and such small animals as mice have saved my life how strange it all is but comrades what shall we do now  we must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again said dorothy and then we can keep on to the emerald city  so the lion being fully refreshed and feeling quite himself again they all started upon the journey greatly enjoying the walk through the soft fresh grass and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the emerald city where the great oz dwelt  the road was smooth and well paved now and the country about was beautiful so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades once more they could see fences built beside the road but these were painted green and when they came to a small house in which a farmer evidently lived that also was painted green they passed by several of these houses during the afternoon and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great lion of which they were very much afraid the people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the munchkins  this must be the land of oz said dorothy and we are surely getting near the emerald city  yes answered the scarecrow everything is green here while in the country of the munchkins blue was the favorite color but the people do not seem to be as friendly as the munchkins and i’m afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night  i should like something to eat besides fruit said the girl and i’m sure toto is nearly starved let us stop at the next house and talk to the people  so when they came to a good-sized farmhouse dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked  a woman opened it just far enough to look out and said what do you want child and why is that great lion with you  we wish to pass the night with you if you will allow us answered dorothy and the lion is my friend and comrade and would not hurt you for the world  is he tame asked the woman opening the door a little wider  oh yes said the girl and he is a great coward too he will be more afraid of you than you are of him  well said the woman after thinking it over and taking another peep at the lion if that is the case you may come in and i will give you some supper and a place to sleep  so they all entered the house where there were besides the woman two children and a man the man had hurt his leg and was lying on the couch in a corner they seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked   where are you all going  to the emerald city said dorothy to see the great oz  oh indeed exclaimed the man are you sure that oz will see you  why not she replied  why it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence i have been to the emerald city many times and it is a beautiful and wonderful place but i have never been permitted to see the great oz nor do i know of any living person who has seen him  does he never go out asked the scarecrow  never he sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face  what is he like asked the girl  that is hard to tell said the man thoughtfully you see oz is a great wizard and can take on any form he wishes so that some say he looks like a bird and some say he looks like an elephant and some say he looks like a cat to others he appears as a beautiful fairy or a brownie or in any other form that pleases him but who the real oz is when he is in his own form no living person can tell  that is very strange said dorothy but we must try in some way to see him or we shall have made our journey for nothing  why do you wish to see the terrible oz asked the man  i want him to give me some brains said the scarecrow eagerly  oh oz could do that easily enough declared the man he has more brains than he needs  and i want him to give me a heart said the tin woodman  that will not trouble him continued the man for oz has a large collection of hearts of all sizes and shapes  and i want him to give me courage said the cowardly lion  oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room said the man which he has covered with a golden plate to keep it from running over he will be glad to give you some  and i want him to send me back to kansas said dorothy  where is kansas asked the man with surprise  i don’t know replied dorothy sorrowfully but it is my home and i’m sure it’s somewhere  very likely well oz can do anything so i suppose he will find kansas for you but first you must get to see him and that will be a hard task for the great wizard does not like to see anyone and he usually has his own way but what do you want he continued speaking to toto toto only wagged his tail for strange to say he could not speak  the woman now called to them that supper was ready so they gathered around the table and dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread and enjoyed her meal the lion ate some of the porridge but did not care for it saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses not for lions the scarecrow and the tin woodman ate nothing at all toto ate a little of everything and was glad to get a good supper again  the woman now gave dorothy a bed to sleep in and toto lay down beside her while the lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night although of course they could not sleep  the next morning as soon as the sun was up they started on their way and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them  that must be the emerald city said dorothy  as they walked on the green glow became brighter and brighter and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the city it was high and thick and of a bright green color  in front of them and at the end of the road of yellow brick was a big gate all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy  there was a bell beside the gate and dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within then the big gate swung slowly open and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds  before them stood a little man about the same size as the munchkins he was clothed all in green from his head to his feet and even his skin was of a greenish tint at his side was a large green box  when he saw dorothy and her companions the man asked what do you wish in the emerald city  we came here to see the great oz said dorothy  the man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over  it has been many years since anyone asked me to see oz he said shaking his head in perplexity he is powerful and terrible and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the great wizard he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant  but it is not a foolish errand nor an idle one replied the scarecrow it is important and we have been told that oz is a good wizard  so he is said the green man and he rules the emerald city wisely and well but to those who are not honest or who approach him from curiosity he is most terrible and few have ever dared ask to see his face i am the guardian of the gates and since you demand to see the great oz i must take you to his palace but first you must put on the spectacles  why asked dorothy  because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the emerald city would blind you even those who live in the city must wear spectacles night and day they are all locked on for oz so ordered it when the city was first built and i have the only key that will unlock them  he opened the big box and dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape all of them had green glasses in them the guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit dorothy and put them over her eyes there were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the guardian of the gates wore around his neck when they were on dorothy could not take them off had she wished but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the emerald city so she said nothing  then the green man fitted spectacles for the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion and even on little toto and all were locked fast with the key  then the guardian of the gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the emerald city     chapter xi the wonderful city of oz   even with eyes protected by the green spectacles dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful city the streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds they walked over a pavement of the same green marble and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds set closely and glittering in the brightness of the sun the window panes were of green glass even the sky above the city had a green tint and the rays of the sun were green  there were many people—men women and children—walking about and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins they looked at dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the lion but no one spoke to them many shops stood in the street and dorothy saw that everything in them was green green candy and green pop-corn were offered for sale as well as green shoes green hats and green clothes of all sorts at one place a man was selling green lemonade and when the children bought it dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies  there seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind the men carried things around in little green carts which they pushed before them everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous  the guardian of the gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building exactly in the middle of the city which was the palace of oz the great wizard there was a soldier before the door dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard  here are strangers said the guardian of the gates to him and they demand to see the great oz  step inside answered the soldier and i will carry your message to him  so they passed through the palace gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds the soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room and when they were seated he said politely   please make yourselves comfortable while i go to the door of the throne room and tell oz you are here  they had to wait a long time before the soldier returned when at last he came back dorothy asked   have you seen oz  oh no returned the soldier i have never seen him but i spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message he said he will grant you an audience if you so desire but each one of you must enter his presence alone and he will admit but one each day therefore as you must remain in the palace for several days i will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey  thank you replied the girl that is very kind of oz  the soldier now blew upon a green whistle and at once a young girl dressed in a pretty green silk gown entered the room she had lovely green hair and green eyes and she bowed low before dorothy as she said follow me and i will show you your room  so dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except toto and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the palace it was the sweetest little room in the world with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane there was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room that shot a spray of green perfume into the air to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin beautiful green flowers stood in the windows and there was a shelf with a row of little green books when dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh they were so funny  in a wardrobe were many green dresses made of silk and satin and velvet and all of them fitted dorothy exactly  make yourself perfectly at home said the green girl and if you wish for anything ring the bell oz will send for you tomorrow morning  she left dorothy alone and went back to the others these she also led to rooms and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the palace of course this politeness was wasted on the scarecrow for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot just within the doorway to wait till morning it would not rest him to lie down and he could not close his eyes so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world the tin woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit for he remembered when he was made of flesh but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order the lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest and did not like being shut up in a room but he had too much sense to let this worry him so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute  the next morning after breakfast the green maiden came to fetch dorothy and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns made of green brocaded satin dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around toto’s neck and they started for the throne room of the great oz  first they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court all dressed in rich costumes these people had nothing to do but talk to each other but they always came to wait outside the throne room every morning although they were never permitted to see oz as dorothy entered they looked at her curiously and one of them whispered   are you really going to look upon the face of oz the terrible  of course answered the girl if he will see me  oh he will see you said the soldier who had taken her message to the wizard although he does not like to have people ask to see him indeed at first he was angry and said i should send you back where you came from then he asked me what you looked like and when i mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested at last i told him about the mark upon your forehead and he decided he would admit you to his presence  just then a bell rang and the green girl said to dorothy that is the signal you must go into the throne room alone  she opened a little door and dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place it was a big round room with a high arched roof and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together in the center of the roof was a great light as bright as the sun which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner  but what interested dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room it was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems as did everything else in the center of the chair was an enormous head without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever there was no hair upon this head but it had eyes and a nose and mouth and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant  as dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily then the mouth moved and dorothy heard a voice say   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  it was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big head so she took courage and answered   i am dorothy the small and meek i have come to you for help  the eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute then said the voice   where did you get the silver shoes  i got them from the wicked witch of the east when my house fell on her and killed her she replied  where did you get the mark upon your forehead continued the voice  that is where the good witch of the north kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you said the girl  again the eyes looked at her sharply and they saw she was telling the truth then oz asked what do you wish me to do  send me back to kansas where my aunt em and uncle henry are she answered earnestly i don’t like your country although it is so beautiful and i am sure aunt em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long  the eyes winked three times and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room and at last they looked at dorothy again  why should i do this for you asked oz  because you are strong and i am weak because you are a great wizard and i am only a little girl  but you were strong enough to kill the wicked witch of the east said oz  that just happened returned dorothy simply i could not help it  well said the head i will give you my answer you have no right to expect me to send you back to kansas unless you do something for me in return in this country everyone must pay for everything he gets if you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first help me and i will help you  what must i do asked the girl  kill the wicked witch of the west answered oz  but i cannot exclaimed dorothy greatly surprised  you killed the witch of the east and you wear the silver shoes which bear a powerful charm there is now but one wicked witch left in all this land and when you can tell me she is dead i will send you back to kansas—but not before  the little girl began to weep she was so much disappointed and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously as if the great oz felt that she could help him if she would  i never killed anything willingly she sobbed even if i wanted to how could i kill the wicked witch if you who are great and terrible cannot kill her yourself how do you expect me to do it  i do not know said the head but that is my answer and until the wicked witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again remember that the witch is wicked—tremendously wicked—and ought to be killed now go and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task  sorrowfully dorothy left the throne room and went back where the lion and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were waiting to hear what oz had said to her there is no hope for me she said sadly for oz will not send me home until i have killed the wicked witch of the west and that i can never do  her friends were sorry but could do nothing to help her so dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep  the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the scarecrow and said   come with me for oz has sent for you  so the scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great throne room where he saw sitting in the emerald throne a most lovely lady she was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels growing from her shoulders were wings gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them  when the scarecrow had bowed as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him before this beautiful creature she looked upon him sweetly and said   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  now the scarecrow who had expected to see the great head dorothy had told him of was much astonished but he answered her bravely  i am only a scarecrow stuffed with straw therefore i have no brains and i come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw so that i may become as much a man as any other in your dominions  why should i do this for you asked the lady  because you are wise and powerful and no one else can help me answered the scarecrow  i never grant favors without some return said oz but this much i will promise if you will kill for me the wicked witch of the west i will bestow upon you a great many brains and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the land of oz  i thought you asked dorothy to kill the witch said the scarecrow in surprise  so i did i don’t care who kills her but until she is dead i will not grant your wish now go and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire  the scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what oz had said and dorothy was surprised to find that the great wizard was not a head as she had seen him but a lovely lady  all the same said the scarecrow she needs a heart as much as the tin woodman  on the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the tin woodman and said   oz has sent for you follow me  so the tin woodman followed him and came to the great throne room he did not know whether he would find oz a lovely lady or a head but he hoped it would be the lovely lady for he said to himself if it is the head i am sure i shall not be given a heart since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me but if it is the lovely lady i shall beg hard for a heart for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted  but when the woodman entered the great throne room he saw neither the head nor the lady for oz had taken the shape of a most terrible beast it was nearly as big as an elephant and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight the beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros only there were five eyes in its face there were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long slim legs thick woolly hair covered every part of it and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined it was fortunate the tin woodman had no heart at that moment for it would have beat loud and fast from terror but being only tin the woodman was not at all afraid although he was much disappointed  i am oz the great and terrible spoke the beast in a voice that was one great roar who are you and why do you seek me  i am a woodman and made of tin therefore i have no heart and cannot love i pray you to give me a heart that i may be as other men are  why should i do this demanded the beast  because i ask it and you alone can grant my request answered the woodman  oz gave a low growl at this but said gruffly  if you indeed desire a heart you must earn it  how asked the woodman  help dorothy to kill the wicked witch of the west replied the beast when the witch is dead come to me and i will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the land of oz  so the tin woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible beast he had seen they all wondered greatly at the many forms the great wizard could take upon himself and the lion said   if he is a beast when i go to see him i shall roar my loudest and so frighten him that he will grant all i ask and if he is the lovely lady i shall pretend to spring upon her and so compel her to do my bidding and if he is the great head he will be at my mercy for i will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire so be of good cheer my friends for all will yet be well  the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the lion to the great throne room and bade him enter the presence of oz  the lion at once passed through the door and glancing around saw to his surprise that before the throne was a ball of fire so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it his first thought was that oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up but when he tried to go nearer the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door  then a low quiet voice came from the ball of fire and these were the words it spoke   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  and the lion answered i am a cowardly lion afraid of everything i came to you to beg that you give me courage so that in reality i may become the king of beasts as men call me  why should i give you courage demanded oz  because of all wizards you are the greatest and alone have power to grant my request answered the lion  the ball of fire burned fiercely for a time and the voice said bring me proof that the wicked witch is dead and that moment i will give you courage but as long as the witch lives you must remain a coward  the lion was angry at this speech but could say nothing in reply and while he stood silently gazing at the ball of fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room he was glad to find his friends waiting for him and told them of his terrible interview with the wizard  what shall we do now asked dorothy sadly  there is only one thing we can do returned the lion and that is to go to the land of the winkies seek out the wicked witch and destroy her  but suppose we cannot said the girl  then i shall never have courage declared the lion  and i shall never have brains added the scarecrow  and i shall never have a heart spoke the tin woodman  and i shall never see aunt em and uncle henry said dorothy beginning to cry  be careful cried the green girl the tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it  so dorothy dried her eyes and said i suppose we must try it but i am sure i do not want to kill anybody even to see aunt em again  i will go with you but i’m too much of a coward to kill the witch said the lion  i will go too declared the scarecrow but i shall not be of much help to you i am such a fool  i haven’t the heart to harm even a witch remarked the tin woodman but if you go i certainly shall go with you  therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning and the woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled the scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better the green girl who was very kind to them filled dorothy’s basket with good things to eat and fastened a little bell around toto’s neck with a green ribbon  they went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the palace and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg     chapter xii the search for the wicked witch   the soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the emerald city until they reached the room where the guardian of the gates lived this officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box and then he politely opened the gate for our friends  which road leads to the wicked witch of the west asked dorothy  there is no road answered the guardian of the gates no one ever wishes to go that way  how then are we to find her inquired the girl  that will be easy replied the man for when she knows you are in the country of the winkies she will find you and make you all her slaves  perhaps not said the scarecrow for we mean to destroy her  oh that is different said the guardian of the gates no one has ever destroyed her before so i naturally thought she would make slaves of you as she has of the rest but take care for she is wicked and fierce and may not allow you to destroy her keep to the west where the sun sets and you cannot fail to find her  they thanked him and bade him good-bye and turned toward the west walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace but now to her surprise she found it was no longer green but pure white the ribbon around toto’s neck had also lost its green color and was as white as dorothy’s dress  the emerald city was soon left far behind as they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the west and the ground was untilled  in the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces for there were no trees to offer them shade so that before night dorothy and toto and the lion were tired and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch  now the wicked witch of the west had but one eye yet that was as powerful as a telescope and could see everywhere so as she sat in the door of her castle she happened to look around and saw dorothy lying asleep with her friends all about her they were a long distance off but the wicked witch was angry to find them in her country so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck  at once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves they had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth  go to those people said the witch and tear them to pieces  are you not going to make them your slaves asked the leader of the wolves  no she answered one is of tin and one of straw one is a girl and another a lion none of them is fit to work so you may tear them into small pieces  very well said the wolf and he dashed away at full speed followed by the others  it was lucky the scarecrow and the woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming  this is my fight said the woodman so get behind me and i will meet them as they come  he seized his axe which he had made very sharp and as the leader of the wolves came on the tin woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s head from its body so that it immediately died as soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up and he also fell under the sharp edge of the tin woodman’s weapon there were forty wolves and forty times a wolf was killed so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the woodman  then he put down his axe and sat beside the scarecrow who said it was a good fight friend  they waited until dorothy awoke the next morning the little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves but the tin woodman told her all she thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast after which they started again upon their journey  now this same morning the wicked witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off she saw all her wolves lying dead and the strangers still traveling through her country this made her angrier than before and she blew her silver whistle twice  straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her enough to darken the sky  and the wicked witch said to the king crow fly at once to the strangers peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces  the wild crows flew in one great flock toward dorothy and her companions when the little girl saw them coming she was afraid  but the scarecrow said this is my battle so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed  so they all lay upon the ground except the scarecrow and he stood up and stretched out his arms and when the crows saw him they were frightened as these birds always are by scarecrows and did not dare to come any nearer but the king crow said   it is only a stuffed man i will peck his eyes out  the king crow flew at the scarecrow who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died and then another crow flew at him and the scarecrow twisted its neck also there were forty crows and forty times the scarecrow twisted a neck until at last all were lying dead beside him then he called to his companions to rise and again they went upon their journey  when the wicked witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap she got into a terrible rage and blew three times upon her silver whistle  forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her  go to the strangers and sting them to death commanded the witch and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where dorothy and her friends were walking but the woodman had seen them coming and the scarecrow had decided what to do  take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the lion he said to the woodman and the bees cannot sting them this the woodman did and as dorothy lay close beside the lion and held toto in her arms the straw covered them entirely  the bees came and found no one but the woodman to sting so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin without hurting the woodman at all and as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees and they lay scattered thick about the woodman like little heaps of fine coal  then dorothy and the lion got up and the girl helped the tin woodman put the straw back into the scarecrow again until he was as good as ever so they started upon their journey once more  the wicked witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth and then she called a dozen of her slaves who were the winkies and gave them sharp spears telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them  the winkies were not a brave people but they had to do as they were told so they marched away until they came near to dorothy then the lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them and the poor winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could  when they returned to the castle the wicked witch beat them well with a strap and sent them back to their work after which she sat down to think what she should do next she could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed but she was a powerful witch as well as a wicked one and she soon made up her mind how to act  there was in her cupboard a golden cap with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it this golden cap had a charm whoever owned it could call three times upon the winged monkeys who would obey any order they were given but no person could command these strange creatures more than three times twice already the wicked witch had used the charm of the cap once was when she had made the winkies her slaves and set herself to rule over their country the winged monkeys had helped her do this the second time was when she had fought against the great oz himself and driven him out of the land of the west the winged monkeys had also helped her in doing this only once more could she use this golden cap for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted but now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone and her slaves had been scared away by the cowardly lion she saw there was only one way left to destroy dorothy and her friends  so the wicked witch took the golden cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly   ep-pe pep-pe kak-ke  next she stood upon her right foot and said   hil-lo hol-lo hel-lo  after this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice   ziz-zy zuz-zy zik  now the charm began to work the sky was darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air there was a rushing of many wings a great chattering and laughing and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the wicked witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders  one much bigger than the others seemed to be their leader he flew close to the witch and said you have called us for the third and last time what do you command  go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the lion said the wicked witch bring that beast to me for i have a mind to harness him like a horse and make him work  your commands shall be obeyed said the leader then with a great deal of chattering and noise the winged monkeys flew away to the place where dorothy and her friends were walking  some of the monkeys seized the tin woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks here they dropped the poor woodman who fell a great distance to the rocks where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan  others of the monkeys caught the scarecrow and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head they made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree  the remaining monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the witch’s castle where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it so that he could not escape  but dorothy they did not harm at all she stood with toto in her arms watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn the leader of the winged monkeys flew up to her his long hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly but he saw the mark of the good witch’s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short motioning the others not to touch her  we dare not harm this little girl he said to them for she is protected by the power of good and that is greater than the power of evil all we can do is to carry her to the castle of the wicked witch and leave her there  so carefully and gently they lifted dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle where they set her down upon the front doorstep then the leader said to the witch   we have obeyed you as far as we were able the tin woodman and the scarecrow are destroyed and the lion is tied up in your yard the little girl we dare not harm nor the dog she carries in her arms your power over our band is now ended and you will never see us again  then all the winged monkeys with much laughing and chattering and noise flew into the air and were soon out of sight  the wicked witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on dorothy’s forehead for she knew well that neither the winged monkeys nor she herself dare hurt the girl in any way she looked down at dorothy’s feet and seeing the silver shoes began to tremble with fear for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them at first the witch was tempted to run away from dorothy but she happened to look into the child’s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the silver shoes gave her so the wicked witch laughed to herself and thought i can still make her my slave for she does not know how to use her power then she said to dorothy harshly and severely   come with me and see that you mind everything i tell you for if you do not i will make an end of you as i did of the tin woodman and the scarecrow  dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen where the witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood  dorothy went to work meekly with her mind made up to work as hard as she could for she was glad the wicked witch had decided not to kill her  with dorothy hard at work the witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the cowardly lion like a horse it would amuse her she was sure to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive but as she opened the gate the lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the witch was afraid and ran out and shut the gate again  if i cannot harness you said the witch to the lion speaking through the bars of the gate i can starve you you shall have nothing to eat until you do as i wish  so after that she took no food to the imprisoned lion but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked are you ready to be harnessed like a horse  and the lion would answer no if you come in this yard i will bite you  the reason the lion did not have to do as the witch wished was that every night while the woman was asleep dorothy carried him food from the cupboard after he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw and dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft shaggy mane while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape but they could find no way to get out of the castle for it was constantly guarded by the yellow winkies who were the slaves of the wicked witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them  the girl had to work hard during the day and often the witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand but in truth she did not dare to strike dorothy because of the mark upon her forehead the child did not know this and was full of fear for herself and toto once the witch struck toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return the witch did not bleed where she was bitten for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before  dorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to kansas and aunt em again sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours with toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress toto did not really care whether he was in kansas or the land of oz so long as dorothy was with him but he knew the little girl was unhappy and that made him unhappy too  now the wicked witch had a great longing to have for her own the silver shoes which the girl always wore her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up and she had used up all the power of the golden cap but if she could only get hold of the silver shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost she watched dorothy carefully to see if she ever took off her shoes thinking she might steal them but the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath the witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in dorothy’s room at night to take the shoes and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark so she never came near when dorothy was bathing indeed the old witch never touched water nor ever let water touch her in any way  but the wicked creature was very cunning and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted she placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes so that when dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar not being able to see it and fell at full length she was not much hurt but in her fall one of the silver shoes came off and before she could reach it the witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot  the wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm and dorothy could not use it against her even had she known how to do so  the little girl seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes grew angry and said to the witch give me back my shoe  i will not retorted the witch for it is now my shoe and not yours  you are a wicked creature cried dorothy you have no right to take my shoe from me  i shall keep it just the same said the witch laughing at her and someday i shall get the other one from you too  this made dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the witch wetting her from head to foot  instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear and then as dorothy looked at her in wonder the witch began to shrink and fall away  see what you have done she screamed in a minute i shall melt away  i’m very sorry indeed said dorothy who was truly frightened to see the witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes  didn’t you know water would be the end of me asked the witch in a wailing despairing voice  of course not answered dorothy how should i  well in a few minutes i shall be all melted and you will have the castle to yourself i have been wicked in my day but i never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds look out—here i go  with these words the witch fell down in a brown melted shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor seeing that she had really melted away to nothing dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess she then swept it all out the door after picking out the silver shoe which was all that was left of the old woman she cleaned and dried it with a cloth and put it on her foot again then being at last free to do as she chose she ran out to the courtyard to tell the lion that the wicked witch of the west had come to an end and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land     chapter xiii the rescue   the cowardly lion was much pleased to hear that the wicked witch had been melted by a bucket of water and dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free they went in together to the castle where dorothy’s first act was to call all the winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves  there was great rejoicing among the yellow winkies for they had been made to work hard during many years for the wicked witch who had always treated them with great cruelty they kept this day as a holiday then and ever after and spent the time in feasting and dancing  if our friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman were only with us said the lion i should be quite happy  don’t you suppose we could rescue them asked the girl anxiously  we can try answered the lion  so they called the yellow winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends and the winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for dorothy who had set them free from bondage so she chose a number of the winkies who looked as if they knew the most and they all started away they traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the tin woodman lay all battered and bent his axe was near him but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short  the winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms and carried him back to the yellow castle again dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend and the lion looking sober and sorry when they reached the castle dorothy said to the winkies   are any of your people tinsmiths  oh yes some of us are very good tinsmiths they told her  then bring them to me she said and when the tinsmiths came bringing with them all their tools in baskets she inquired can you straighten out those dents in the tin woodman and bend him back into shape again and solder him together where he is broken  the tinsmiths looked the woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever so they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the tin woodman until at last he was straightened out into his old form and his joints worked as well as ever to be sure there were several patches on him but the tinsmiths did a good job and as the woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all  when at last he walked into dorothy’s room and thanked her for rescuing him he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy and dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron so his joints would not be rusted at the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again and these tears did not need to be wiped away as for the lion he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried  if we only had the scarecrow with us again said the tin woodman when dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened i should be quite happy  we must try to find him said the girl  so she called the winkies to help her and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the winged monkeys had tossed the scarecrow’s clothes  it was a very tall tree and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it but the woodman said at once i’ll chop it down and then we can get the scarecrow’s clothes  now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the woodman himself another of the winkies who was a goldsmith had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the woodman’s axe instead of the old broken handle others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver  as soon as he had spoken the tin woodman began to chop and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash whereupon the scarecrow’s clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground  dorothy picked them up and had the winkies carry them back to the castle where they were stuffed with nice clean straw and behold here was the scarecrow as good as ever thanking them over and over again for saving him  now that they were reunited dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the yellow castle where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable  but one day the girl thought of aunt em and said we must go back to oz and claim his promise  yes said the woodman at last i shall get my heart  and i shall get my brains added the scarecrow joyfully  and i shall get my courage said the lion thoughtfully  and i shall get back to kansas cried dorothy clapping her hands oh let us start for the emerald city tomorrow  this they decided to do the next day they called the winkies together and bade them good-bye the winkies were sorry to have them go and they had grown so fond of the tin woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the yellow land of the west finding they were determined to go the winkies gave toto and the lion each a golden collar and to dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds and to the scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick to keep him from stumbling and to the tin woodman they offered a silver oil-can inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels  every one of the travelers made the winkies a pretty speech in return and all shook hands with them until their arms ached  dorothy went to the witch’s cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey and there she saw the golden cap she tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly she did not know anything about the charm of the golden cap but she saw that it was pretty so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket  then being prepared for the journey they all started for the emerald city and the winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them     chapter xiv the winged monkeys   you will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the castle of the wicked witch and the emerald city when the four travelers went in search of the witch she had seen them coming and so sent the winged monkeys to bring them to her it was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried they knew of course they must go straight east toward the rising sun and they started off in the right way but at noon when the sun was over their heads they did not know which was east and which was west and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields they kept on walking however and at night the moon came out and shone brightly so they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the scarecrow and the tin woodman  the next morning the sun was behind a cloud but they started on as if they were quite sure which way they were going  if we walk far enough said dorothy i am sure we shall sometime come to some place  but day by day passed away and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields the scarecrow began to grumble a bit  we have surely lost our way he said and unless we find it again in time to reach the emerald city i shall never get my brains  nor i my heart declared the tin woodman it seems to me i can scarcely wait till i get to oz and you must admit this is a very long journey  you see said the cowardly lion with a whimper i haven’t the courage to keep tramping forever without getting anywhere at all  then dorothy lost heart she sat down on the grass and looked at her companions and they sat down and looked at her and toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head so he put out his tongue and panted and looked at dorothy as if to ask what they should do next  suppose we call the field mice she suggested they could probably tell us the way to the emerald city  to be sure they could cried the scarecrow why didn’t we think of that before  dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the queen of the mice had given it to her in a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet and many of the small gray mice came running up to her among them was the queen herself who asked in her squeaky little voice   what can i do for my friends  we have lost our way said dorothy can you tell us where the emerald city is  certainly answered the queen but it is a great way off for you have had it at your backs all this time then she noticed dorothy’s golden cap and said why don’t you use the charm of the cap and call the winged monkeys to you they will carry you to the city of oz in less than an hour  i didn’t know there was a charm answered dorothy in surprise what is it  it is written inside the golden cap replied the queen of the mice but if you are going to call the winged monkeys we must run away for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us  won’t they hurt me asked the girl anxiously  oh no they must obey the wearer of the cap good-bye and she scampered out of sight with all the mice hurrying after her  dorothy looked inside the golden cap and saw some words written upon the lining these she thought must be the charm so she read the directions carefully and put the cap upon her head  ep-pe pep-pe kak-ke she said standing on her left foot  what did you say asked the scarecrow who did not know what she was doing  hil-lo hol-lo hel-lo dorothy went on standing this time on her right foot  hello replied the tin woodman calmly  ziz-zy zuz-zy zik said dorothy who was now standing on both feet this ended the saying of the charm and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings as the band of winged monkeys flew up to them  the king bowed low before dorothy and asked what is your command  we wish to go to the emerald city said the child and we have lost our way  we will carry you replied the king and no sooner had he spoken than two of the monkeys caught dorothy in their arms and flew away with her others took the scarecrow and the woodman and the lion and one little monkey seized toto and flew after them although the dog tried hard to bite him  the scarecrow and the tin woodman were rather frightened at first for they remembered how badly the winged monkeys had treated them before but they saw that no harm was intended so they rode through the air quite cheerfully and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them  dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest monkeys one of them the king himself they had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her  why do you have to obey the charm of the golden cap she asked  that is a long story answered the king with a winged laugh but as we have a long journey before us i will pass the time by telling you about it if you wish  i shall be glad to hear it she replied  once began the leader we were a free people living happily in the great forest flying from tree to tree eating nuts and fruit and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings chasing birds and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest but we were careless and happy and full of fun and enjoyed every minute of the day this was many years ago long before oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land  there lived here then away at the north a beautiful princess who was also a powerful sorceress all her magic was used to help the people and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good her name was gayelette and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby everyone loved her but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise at last however she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish when he grew to manhood quelala as he was called was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land while his manly beauty was so great that gayelette loved him dearly and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding  my grandfather was at that time the king of the winged monkeys which lived in the forest near gayelette’s palace and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner one day just before the wedding my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw quelala walking beside the river he was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do at his word the band flew down and seized quelala carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river and then dropped him into the water  ‘swim out my fine fellow’ cried my grandfather ‘and see if the water has spotted your clothes’ quelala was much too wise not to swim and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune he laughed when he came to the top of the water and swam in to shore but when gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river  the princess was angry and she knew of course who did it she had all the winged monkeys brought before her and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated quelala and dropped in the river but my grandfather pleaded hard for he knew the monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied and quelala said a kind word for them also so that gayelette finally spared them on condition that the winged monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the golden cap this cap had been made for a wedding present to quelala and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom of course my grandfather and all the other monkeys at once agreed to the condition and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the golden cap whosoever he may be  and what became of them asked dorothy who had been greatly interested in the story  quelala being the first owner of the golden cap replied the monkey he was the first to lay his wishes upon us as his bride could not bear the sight of us he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a winged monkey which we were glad to do for we were all afraid of her  this was all we ever had to do until the golden cap fell into the hands of the wicked witch of the west who made us enslave the winkies and afterward drive oz himself out of the land of the west now the golden cap is yours and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us  as the monkey king finished his story dorothy looked down and saw the green shining walls of the emerald city before them she wondered at the rapid flight of the monkeys but was glad the journey was over the strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the city the king bowed low to dorothy and then flew swiftly away followed by all his band  that was a good ride said the little girl  yes and a quick way out of our troubles replied the lion how lucky it was you brought away that wonderful cap     chapter xv the discovery of oz the terrible   the four travelers walked up to the great gate of emerald city and rang the bell after ringing several times it was opened by the same guardian of the gates they had met before  what are you back again he asked in surprise  do you not see us answered the scarecrow  but i thought you had gone to visit the wicked witch of the west  we did visit her said the scarecrow  and she let you go again asked the man in wonder  she could not help it for she is melted explained the scarecrow  melted well that is good news indeed said the man who melted her  it was dorothy said the lion gravely  good gracious exclaimed the man and he bowed very low indeed before her  then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes just as he had done before afterward they passed on through the gate into the emerald city when the people heard from the guardian of the gates that dorothy had melted the wicked witch of the west they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the palace of oz  the soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door but he let them in at once and they were again met by the beautiful green girl who showed each of them to their old rooms at once so they might rest until the great oz was ready to receive them  the soldier had the news carried straight to oz that dorothy and the other travelers had come back again after destroying the wicked witch but oz made no reply they thought the great wizard would send for them at once but he did not they had no word from him the next day nor the next nor the next the waiting was tiresome and wearing and at last they grew vexed that oz should treat them in so poor a fashion after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery so the scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to oz saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the winged monkeys to help them and find out whether he kept his promises or not when the wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the throne room at four minutes after nine o’clock the next morning he had once met the winged monkeys in the land of the west and he did not wish to meet them again  the four travelers passed a sleepless night each thinking of the gift oz had promised to bestow on him dorothy fell asleep only once and then she dreamed she was in kansas where aunt em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again  promptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them and four minutes later they all went into the throne room of the great oz  of course each one of them expected to see the wizard in the shape he had taken before and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room they kept close to the door and closer to one another for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen oz take  presently they heard a solemn voice that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome and it said   i am oz the great and terrible why do you seek me  they looked again in every part of the room and then seeing no one dorothy asked where are you  i am everywhere answered the voice but to the eyes of common mortals i am invisible i will now seat myself upon my throne that you may converse with me indeed the voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself so they walked toward it and stood in a row while dorothy said   we have come to claim our promise o oz  what promise asked oz  you promised to send me back to kansas when the wicked witch was destroyed said the girl  and you promised to give me brains said the scarecrow  and you promised to give me a heart said the tin woodman  and you promised to give me courage said the cowardly lion  is the wicked witch really destroyed asked the voice and dorothy thought it trembled a little  yes she answered i melted her with a bucket of water  dear me said the voice how sudden well come to me tomorrow for i must have time to think it over  you’ve had plenty of time already said the tin woodman angrily  we shan’t wait a day longer said the scarecrow  you must keep your promises to us exclaimed dorothy  the lion thought it might be as well to frighten the wizard so he gave a large loud roar which was so fierce and dreadful that toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner as it fell with a crash they looked that way and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder for they saw standing in just the spot the screen had hidden a little old man with a bald head and a wrinkled face who seemed to be as much surprised as they were the tin woodman raising his axe rushed toward the little man and cried out who are you  i am oz the great and terrible said the little man in a trembling voice but don’t strike me—please don’t—and i’ll do anything you want me to  our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay  i thought oz was a great head said dorothy  and i thought oz was a lovely lady said the scarecrow  and i thought oz was a terrible beast said the tin woodman  and i thought oz was a ball of fire exclaimed the lion  no you are all wrong said the little man meekly i have been making believe  making believe cried dorothy are you not a great wizard  hush my dear he said don’t speak so loud or you will be overheard—and i should be ruined i’m supposed to be a great wizard  and aren’t you she asked  not a bit of it my dear i’m just a common man  you’re more than that said the scarecrow in a grieved tone you’re a humbug  exactly so declared the little man rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him i am a humbug  but this is terrible said the tin woodman how shall i ever get my heart  or i my courage asked the lion  or i my brains wailed the scarecrow wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve  my dear friends said oz i pray you not to speak of these little things think of me and the terrible trouble i’m in at being found out  doesn’t anyone else know you’re a humbug asked dorothy  no one knows it but you four—and myself replied oz i have fooled everyone so long that i thought i should never be found out it was a great mistake my ever letting you into the throne room usually i will not see even my subjects and so they believe i am something terrible  but i don’t understand said dorothy in bewilderment how was it that you appeared to me as a great head  that was one of my tricks answered oz step this way please and i will tell you all about it  he led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the throne room and they all followed him he pointed to one corner in which lay the great head made out of many thicknesses of paper and with a carefully painted face  this i hung from the ceiling by a wire said oz i stood behind the screen and pulled a thread to make the eyes move and the mouth open  but how about the voice she inquired  oh i am a ventriloquist said the little man i can throw the sound of my voice wherever i wish so that you thought it was coming out of the head here are the other things i used to deceive you he showed the scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely lady and the tin woodman saw that his terrible beast was nothing but a lot of skins sewn together with slats to keep their sides out as for the ball of fire the false wizard had hung that also from the ceiling it was really a ball of cotton but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely  really said the scarecrow you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug  i am—i certainly am answered the little man sorrowfully but it was the only thing i could do sit down please there are plenty of chairs and i will tell you my story  so they sat down and listened while he told the following tale  i was born in omaha—  why that isn’t very far from kansas cried dorothy  no but it’s farther from here he said shaking his head at her sadly when i grew up i became a ventriloquist and at that i was very well trained by a great master i can imitate any kind of a bird or beast here he mewed so like a kitten that toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was after a time continued oz i tired of that and became a balloonist  what is that asked dorothy  a man who goes up in a balloon on circus day so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus he explained  oh she said i know  well one day i went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted so that i couldn’t come down again it went way up above the clouds so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many many miles away for a day and a night i traveled through the air and on the morning of the second day i awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country  it came down gradually and i was not hurt a bit but i found myself in the midst of a strange people who seeing me come from the clouds thought i was a great wizard of course i let them think so because they were afraid of me and promised to do anything i wished them to  just to amuse myself and keep the good people busy i ordered them to build this city and my palace and they did it all willingly and well then i thought as the country was so green and beautiful i would call it the emerald city and to make the name fit better i put green spectacles on all the people so that everything they saw was green  but isn’t everything here green asked dorothy  no more than in any other city replied oz but when you wear green spectacles why of course everything you see looks green to you the emerald city was built a great many years ago for i was a young man when the balloon brought me here and i am a very old man now but my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an emerald city and it certainly is a beautiful place abounding in jewels and precious metals and every good thing that is needed to make one happy i have been good to the people and they like me but ever since this palace was built i have shut myself up and would not see any of them  one of my greatest fears was the witches for while i had no magical powers at all i soon found out that the witches were really able to do wonderful things there were four of them in this country and they ruled the people who live in the north and south and east and west fortunately the witches of the north and south were good and i knew they would do me no harm but the witches of the east and west were terribly wicked and had they not thought i was more powerful than they themselves they would surely have destroyed me as it was i lived in deadly fear of them for many years so you can imagine how pleased i was when i heard your house had fallen on the wicked witch of the east when you came to me i was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other witch but now that you have melted her i am ashamed to say that i cannot keep my promises  i think you are a very bad man said dorothy  oh no my dear i’m really a very good man but i’m a very bad wizard i must admit  can’t you give me brains asked the scarecrow  you don’t need them you are learning something every day a baby has brains but it doesn’t know much experience is the only thing that brings knowledge and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get  that may all be true said the scarecrow but i shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains  the false wizard looked at him carefully  well he said with a sigh i’m not much of a magician as i said but if you will come to me tomorrow morning i will stuff your head with brains i cannot tell you how to use them however you must find that out for yourself  oh thank you—thank you cried the scarecrow i’ll find a way to use them never fear  but how about my courage asked the lion anxiously  you have plenty of courage i am sure answered oz all you need is confidence in yourself there is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger the true courage is in facing danger when you are afraid and that kind of courage you have in plenty  perhaps i have but i’m scared just the same said the lion i shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid  very well i will give you that sort of courage tomorrow replied oz  how about my heart asked the tin woodman  why as for that answered oz i think you are wrong to want a heart it makes most people unhappy if you only knew it you are in luck not to have a heart  that must be a matter of opinion said the tin woodman for my part i will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur if you will give me the heart  very well answered oz meekly come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart i have played wizard for so many years that i may as well continue the part a little longer  and now said dorothy how am i to get back to kansas  we shall have to think about that replied the little man give me two or three days to consider the matter and i’ll try to find a way to carry you over the desert in the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests and while you live in the palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish there is only one thing i ask in return for my help—such as it is you must keep my secret and tell no one i am a humbug  they agreed to say nothing of what they had learned and went back to their rooms in high spirits even dorothy had hope that the great and terrible humbug as she called him would find a way to send her back to kansas and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything     chapter xvi the magic art of the great humbug   next morning the scarecrow said to his friends   congratulate me i am going to oz to get my brains at last when i return i shall be as other men are  i have always liked you as you were said dorothy simply  it is kind of you to like a scarecrow he replied but surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the throne room where he rapped upon the door  come in said oz  the scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window engaged in deep thought  i have come for my brains remarked the scarecrow a little uneasily  oh yes sit down in that chair please replied oz you must excuse me for taking your head off but i shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place  that’s all right said the scarecrow you are quite welcome to take my head off as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again  so the wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran which he mixed with a great many pins and needles having shaken them together thoroughly he filled the top of the scarecrow’s head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw to hold it in place  when he had fastened the scarecrow’s head on his body again he said to him hereafter you will be a great man for i have given you a lot of bran-new brains  the scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish and having thanked oz warmly he went back to his friends  dorothy looked at him curiously his head was quite bulged out at the top with brains  how do you feel she asked  i feel wise indeed he answered earnestly when i get used to my brains i shall know everything  why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head asked the tin woodman  that is proof that he is sharp remarked the lion  well i must go to oz and get my heart said the woodman so he walked to the throne room and knocked at the door  come in called oz and the woodman entered and said i have come for my heart  very well answered the little man but i shall have to cut a hole in your breast so i can put your heart in the right place i hope it won’t hurt you  oh no answered the woodman i shall not feel it at all  so oz brought a pair of tinsmith’s shears and cut a small square hole in the left side of the tin woodman’s breast then going to a chest of drawers he took out a pretty heart made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust  isn’t it a beauty he asked  it is indeed replied the woodman who was greatly pleased but is it a kind heart  oh very answered oz he put the heart in the woodman’s breast and then replaced the square of tin soldering it neatly together where it had been cut  there said he now you have a heart that any man might be proud of i’m sorry i had to put a patch on your breast but it really couldn’t be helped  never mind the patch exclaimed the happy woodman i am very grateful to you and shall never forget your kindness  don’t speak of it replied oz  then the tin woodman went back to his friends who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune  the lion now walked to the throne room and knocked at the door  come in said oz  i have come for my courage announced the lion entering the room  very well answered the little man i will get it for you  he went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish beautifully carved placing this before the cowardly lion who sniffed at it as if he did not like it the wizard said   drink  what is it asked the lion  well answered oz if it were inside of you it would be courage you know of course that courage is always inside one so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it therefore i advise you to drink it as soon as possible  the lion hesitated no longer but drank till the dish was empty  how do you feel now asked oz  full of courage replied the lion who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune  oz left to himself smiled to think of his success in giving the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion exactly what they thought they wanted how can i help being a humbug he said when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done it was easy to make the scarecrow and the lion and the woodman happy because they imagined i could do anything but it will take more than imagination to carry dorothy back to kansas and i’m sure i don’t know how it can be done     chapter xvii how the balloon was launched   for three days dorothy heard nothing from oz these were sad days for the little girl although her friends were all quite happy and contented the scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself when the tin woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast and he told dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh the lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce kalidahs  thus each of the little party was satisfied except dorothy who longed more than ever to get back to kansas  on the fourth day to her great joy oz sent for her and when she entered the throne room he greeted her pleasantly   sit down my dear i think i have found the way to get you out of this country  and back to kansas she asked eagerly  well i’m not sure about kansas said oz for i haven’t the faintest notion which way it lies but the first thing to do is to cross the desert and then it should be easy to find your way home  how can i cross the desert she inquired  well i’ll tell you what i think said the little man you see when i came to this country it was in a balloon you also came through the air being carried by a cyclone so i believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air now it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone but i’ve been thinking the matter over and i believe i can make a balloon  how asked dorothy  a balloon said oz is made of silk which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it i have plenty of silk in the palace so it will be no trouble to make the balloon but in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with to make it float  if it won’t float remarked dorothy it will be of no use to us  true answered oz but there is another way to make it float which is to fill it with hot air hot air isn’t as good as gas for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert and we should be lost  we exclaimed the girl are you going with me  yes of course replied oz i am tired of being such a humbug if i should go out of this palace my people would soon discover i am not a wizard and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them so i have to stay shut up in these rooms all day and it gets tiresome i’d much rather go back to kansas with you and be in a circus again  i shall be glad to have your company said dorothy  thank you he answered now if you will help me sew the silk together we will begin to work on our balloon  so dorothy took a needle and thread and as fast as oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together first there was a strip of light green silk then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green for oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them it took three days to sew all the strips together but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long  then oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue to make it airtight after which he announced that the balloon was ready  but we must have a basket to ride in he said so he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon  when it was all ready oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother wizard who lived in the clouds the news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight  oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the palace and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity the tin woodman had chopped a big pile of wood and now he made a fire of it and oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air until finally the basket just touched the ground  then oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice   i am now going away to make a visit while i am gone the scarecrow will rule over you i command you to obey him as you would me  the balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground for the air within it was hot and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky  come dorothy cried the wizard hurry up or the balloon will fly away  i can’t find toto anywhere replied dorothy who did not wish to leave her little dog behind toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten and dorothy at last found him she picked him up and ran towards the balloon  she was within a few steps of it and oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket when crack went the ropes and the balloon rose into the air without her  come back she screamed i want to go too  i can’t come back my dear called oz from the basket good-bye  good-bye shouted everyone and all eyes were turned upward to where the wizard was riding in the basket rising every moment farther and farther into the sky  and that was the last any of them ever saw of oz the wonderful wizard though he may have reached omaha safely and be there now for all we know but the people remembered him lovingly and said to one another   oz was always our friend when he was here he built for us this beautiful emerald city and now he is gone he has left the wise scarecrow to rule over us  still for many days they grieved over the loss of the wonderful wizard and would not be comforted     chapter xviii away to the south   dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to kansas again but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon and she also felt sorry at losing oz and so did her companions  the tin woodman came to her and said   truly i should be ungrateful if i failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart i should like to cry a little because oz is gone if you will kindly wipe away my tears so that i shall not rust  with pleasure she answered and brought a towel at once then the tin woodman wept for several minutes and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel when he had finished he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can to guard against mishap  the scarecrow was now the ruler of the emerald city and although he was not a wizard the people were proud of him for they said there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man and so far as they knew they were quite right  the morning after the balloon had gone up with oz the four travelers met in the throne room and talked matters over the scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him  we are not so unlucky said the new ruler for this palace and the emerald city belong to us and we can do just as we please when i remember that a short time ago i was up on a pole in a farmer’s cornfield and that now i am the ruler of this beautiful city i am quite satisfied with my lot  i also said the tin woodman am well-pleased with my new heart and really that was the only thing i wished in all the world  for my part i am content in knowing i am as brave as any beast that ever lived if not braver said the lion modestly  if dorothy would only be contented to live in the emerald city continued the scarecrow we might all be happy together  but i don’t want to live here cried dorothy i want to go to kansas and live with aunt em and uncle henry  well then what can be done inquired the woodman  the scarecrow decided to think and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains finally he said   why not call the winged monkeys and ask them to carry you over the desert  i never thought of that said dorothy joyfully it’s just the thing i’ll go at once for the golden cap  when she brought it into the throne room she spoke the magic words and soon the band of winged monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her  this is the second time you have called us said the monkey king bowing before the little girl what do you wish  i want you to fly with me to kansas said dorothy  but the monkey king shook his head  that cannot be done he said we belong to this country alone and cannot leave it there has never been a winged monkey in kansas yet and i suppose there never will be for they don’t belong there we shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power but we cannot cross the desert good-bye  and with another bow the monkey king spread his wings and flew away through the window followed by all his band  dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment i have wasted the charm of the golden cap to no purpose she said for the winged monkeys cannot help me  it is certainly too bad said the tender-hearted woodman  the scarecrow was thinking again and his head bulged out so horribly that dorothy feared it would burst  let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers he said and ask his advice  so the soldier was summoned and entered the throne room timidly for while oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door  this little girl said the scarecrow to the soldier wishes to cross the desert how can she do so  i cannot tell answered the soldier for nobody has ever crossed the desert unless it is oz himself  is there no one who can help me asked dorothy earnestly  glinda might he suggested  who is glinda inquired the scarecrow  the witch of the south she is the most powerful of all the witches and rules over the quadlings besides her castle stands on the edge of the desert so she may know a way to cross it  glinda is a good witch isn’t she asked the child  the quadlings think she is good said the soldier and she is kind to everyone i have heard that glinda is a beautiful woman who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived  how can i get to her castle asked dorothy  the road is straight to the south he answered but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers there are wild beasts in the woods and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country for this reason none of the quadlings ever come to the emerald city  the soldier then left them and the scarecrow said   it seems in spite of dangers that the best thing dorothy can do is to travel to the land of the south and ask glinda to help her for of course if dorothy stays here she will never get back to kansas  you must have been thinking again remarked the tin woodman  i have said the scarecrow  i shall go with dorothy declared the lion for i am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again i am really a wild beast you know besides dorothy will need someone to protect her  that is true agreed the woodman my axe may be of service to her so i also will go with her to the land of the south  when shall we start asked the scarecrow  are you going they asked in surprise  certainly if it wasn’t for dorothy i should never have had brains she lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the emerald city so my good luck is all due to her and i shall never leave her until she starts back to kansas for good and all  thank you said dorothy gratefully you are all very kind to me but i should like to start as soon as possible  we shall go tomorrow morning returned the scarecrow so now let us all get ready for it will be a long journey     chapter xix attacked by the fighting trees   the next morning dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers who had walked with them as far as the gate when the guardian of the gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful city to get into new trouble but he at once unlocked their spectacles which he put back into the green box and gave them many good wishes to carry with them  you are now our ruler he said to the scarecrow so you must come back to us as soon as possible  i certainly shall if i am able the scarecrow replied but i must help dorothy to get home first  as dorothy bade the good-natured guardian a last farewell she said   i have been very kindly treated in your lovely city and everyone has been good to me i cannot tell you how grateful i am  don’t try my dear he answered we should like to keep you with us but if it is your wish to return to kansas i hope you will find a way he then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey  the sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the land of the south they were all in the best of spirits and laughed and chatted together dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were glad to be of use to her as for the lion he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again while toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies barking merrily all the time  city life does not agree with me at all remarked the lion as they walked along at a brisk pace i have lost much flesh since i lived there and now i am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous i have grown  they now turned and took a last look at the emerald city all they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls and high up above everything the spires and dome of the palace of oz  oz was not such a bad wizard after all said the tin woodman as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast  he knew how to give me brains and very good brains too said the scarecrow  if oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me added the lion he would have been a brave man  dorothy said nothing oz had not kept the promise he made her but he had done his best so she forgave him as he said he was a good man even if he was a bad wizard  the first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the emerald city on every side they slept that night on the grass with nothing but the stars over them and they rested very well indeed  in the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood there was no way of going around it for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see and besides they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost so they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest  the scarecrow who was in the lead finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath so he walked forward to the tree but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers  this did not hurt the scarecrow but it surprised him and he looked rather dizzy when dorothy picked him up  here is another space between the trees called the lion  let me try it first said the scarecrow for it doesn’t hurt me to get thrown about he walked up to another tree as he spoke but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again  this is strange exclaimed dorothy what shall we do  the trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us and stop our journey remarked the lion  i believe i will try it myself said the woodman and shouldering his axe he marched up to the first tree that had handled the scarecrow so roughly when a big branch bent down to seize him the woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two at once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain and the tin woodman passed safely under it  come on he shouted to the others be quick they all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury except toto who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled but the woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free  the other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches and that probably these were the policemen of the forest and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it  the four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood then to their surprise they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china it was smooth like the surface of a dish and higher than their heads  what shall we do now asked dorothy  i will make a ladder said the tin woodman for we certainly must climb over the wall     chapter xx the dainty china country   while the woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest dorothy lay down and slept for she was tired by the long walk the lion also curled himself up to sleep and toto lay beside him  the scarecrow watched the woodman while he worked and said to him   i cannot think why this wall is here nor what it is made of  rest your brains and do not worry about the wall replied the woodman when we have climbed over it we shall know what is on the other side  after a time the ladder was finished it looked clumsy but the tin woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose the scarecrow waked dorothy and the lion and toto and told them that the ladder was ready the scarecrow climbed up the ladder first but he was so awkward that dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off when he got his head over the top of the wall the scarecrow said oh my  go on exclaimed dorothy  so the scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall and dorothy put her head over and cried oh my just as the scarecrow had done  then toto came up and immediately began to bark but dorothy made him be still  the lion climbed the ladder next and the tin woodman came last but both of them cried oh my as soon as they looked over the wall when they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down and saw a strange sight  before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors these houses were quite small the biggest of them reaching only as high as dorothy’s waist there were also pretty little barns with china fences around them and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens all made of china were standing about in groups  but the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country there were milkmaids and shepherdesses with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them and golden buckles on their shoes and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads wearing ermine robes and satin doublets and funny clowns in ruffled gowns with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall pointed caps and strangest of all these people were all made of china even to their clothes and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than dorothy’s knee  no one did so much as look at the travelers at first except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice afterwards running away again  how shall we get down asked dorothy  they found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up so the scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet when all were safely down they picked up the scarecrow whose body was quite flattened out and patted his straw into shape again  we must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side said dorothy for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due south  they began walking through the country of the china people and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow as they drew near the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool the pail and even the milkmaid herself and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter  dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off and that the pail was lying in several small pieces while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow  there cried the milkmaid angrily see what you have done my cow has broken her leg and i must take her to the mender’s shop and have it glued on again what do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow  i’m very sorry returned dorothy please forgive us  but the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer she picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away the poor animal limping on three legs as she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers holding her nicked elbow close to her side  dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap  we must be very careful here said the kind-hearted woodman or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it  a little farther on dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young princess who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away  dorothy wanted to see more of the princess so she ran after her but the china girl cried out   don’t chase me don’t chase me  she had such a frightened little voice that dorothy stopped and said why not  because answered the princess also stopping a safe distance away if i run i may fall down and break myself  but could you not be mended asked the girl  oh yes but one is never so pretty after being mended you know replied the princess  i suppose not said dorothy  now there is mr joker one of our clowns continued the china lady who is always trying to stand upon his head he has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places and doesn’t look at all pretty here he comes now so you can see for yourself  indeed a jolly little clown came walking toward them and dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places  the clown put his hands in his pockets and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily he said       my lady fair    why do you stare at poor old mr joker     you’re quite as stiff     and prim as if you’d eaten up a poker   be quiet sir said the princess can’t you see these are strangers and should be treated with respect  well that’s respect i expect declared the clown and immediately stood upon his head  don’t mind mr joker said the princess to dorothy he is considerably cracked in his head and that makes him foolish  oh i don’t mind him a bit said dorothy but you are so beautiful she continued that i am sure i could love you dearly won’t you let me carry you back to kansas and stand you on aunt em’s mantel i could carry you in my basket  that would make me very unhappy answered the china princess you see here in our country we live contentedly and can talk and move around as we please but whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen and we can only stand straight and look pretty of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country  i would not make you unhappy for all the world exclaimed dorothy so i’ll just say good-bye  good-bye replied the princess  they walked carefully through the china country the little animals and all the people scampered out of their way fearing the strangers would break them and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall  it was not so high as the first however and by standing upon the lion’s back they all managed to scramble to the top then the lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall but just as he jumped he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces  that was too bad said dorothy but really i think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow’s leg and a church they are all so brittle  they are indeed said the scarecrow and i am thankful i am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged there are worse things in the world than being a scarecrow     chapter xxi the lion becomes the king of beasts   after climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall rank grass it was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight however by carefully picking their way they got safely along until they reached solid ground but here the country seemed wilder than ever and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen  this forest is perfectly delightful declared the lion looking around him with joy never have i seen a more beautiful place  it seems gloomy said the scarecrow  not a bit of it answered the lion i should like to live here all my life see how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home  perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now said dorothy  i suppose there are returned the lion but i do not see any of them about  they walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther dorothy and toto and the lion lay down to sleep while the woodman and the scarecrow kept watch over them as usual  when morning came they started again before they had gone far they heard a low rumble as of the growling of many wild animals toto whimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety there were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history and for a moment dorothy was afraid but the lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble  as he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic the biggest of the tigers came up to the lion and bowed saying   welcome o king of beasts you have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more  what is your trouble asked the lion quietly  we are all threatened answered the tiger by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest it is a most tremendous monster like a great spider with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk it has eight of these long legs and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth where he eats it as a spider does a fly not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us  the lion thought for a moment  are there any other lions in this forest he asked  no there were some but the monster has eaten them all and besides they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you  if i put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as king of the forest inquired the lion  we will do that gladly returned the tiger and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar  we will  where is this great spider of yours now asked the lion  yonder among the oak trees said the tiger pointing with his forefoot  take good care of these friends of mine said the lion and i will go at once to fight the monster  he bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy  the great spider was lying asleep when the lion found him and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said and its body covered with coarse black hair it had a great mouth with a row of sharp teeth a foot long but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp’s waist this gave the lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster’s back then with one blow of his heavy paw all armed with sharp claws he knocked the spider’s head from its body jumping down he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling when he knew it was quite dead  the lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly   you need fear your enemy no longer  then the beasts bowed down to the lion as their king and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as dorothy was safely on her way to kansas     chapter xxii the country of the quadlings   the four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock  that will be a hard climb said the scarecrow but we must get over the hill nevertheless  so he led the way and the others followed they had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out keep back  who are you asked the scarecrow  then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said this hill belongs to us and we don’t allow anyone to cross it  but we must cross it said the scarecrow we’re going to the country of the quadlings  but you shall not replied the voice and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen  he was quite short and stout and had a big head which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles but he had no arms at all and seeing this the scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill so he said i’m sorry not to do as you wish but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not and he walked boldly forward  as quick as lightning the man’s head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head where it was flat struck the scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling over and over down the hill almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body and the man laughed harshly as he said it isn’t as easy as you think  a chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks and dorothy saw hundreds of the armless hammer-heads upon the hillside one behind every rock  the lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the scarecrow’s mishap and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill  again a head shot swiftly out and the great lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball  dorothy ran down and helped the scarecrow to his feet and the lion came up to her feeling rather bruised and sore and said it is useless to fight people with shooting heads no one can withstand them  what can we do then she asked  call the winged monkeys suggested the tin woodman you have still the right to command them once more  very well she answered and putting on the golden cap she uttered the magic words the monkeys were as prompt as ever and in a few moments the entire band stood before her  what are your commands inquired the king of the monkeys bowing low  carry us over the hill to the country of the quadlings answered the girl  it shall be done said the king and at once the winged monkeys caught the four travelers and toto up in their arms and flew away with them as they passed over the hill the hammer-heads yelled with vexation and shot their heads high in the air but they could not reach the winged monkeys which carried dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the quadlings  this is the last time you can summon us said the leader to dorothy so good-bye and good luck to you  good-bye and thank you very much returned the girl and the monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling  the country of the quadlings seemed rich and happy there was field upon field of ripening grain with well-paved roads running between and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them the fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the winkies and blue in the country of the munchkins the quadlings themselves who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured were dressed all in red which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain  the monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door it was opened by the farmer’s wife and when dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies and a bowl of milk for toto  how far is it to the castle of glinda asked the child  it is not a great way answered the farmer’s wife take the road to the south and you will soon reach it  thanking the good woman they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful castle before the gates were three young girls dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid and as dorothy approached one of them said to her   why have you come to the south country  to see the good witch who rules here she answered will you take me to her  let me have your name and i will ask glinda if she will receive you they told who they were and the girl soldier went into the castle after a few moments she came back to say that dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once     chapter xxiii glinda the good witch grants dorothy’s wish   before they went to see glinda however they were taken to a room of the castle where dorothy washed her face and combed her hair and the lion shook the dust out of his mane and the scarecrow patted himself into his best shape and the woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints  when they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the witch glinda sat upon a throne of rubies  she was both beautiful and young to their eyes her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue and they looked kindly upon the little girl  what can i do for you my child she asked  dorothy told the witch all her story  how the cyclone had brought her to the land of oz how she had found her companions and of the wonderful adventures they had met with  my greatest wish now she added is to get back to kansas for aunt em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me and that will make her put on mourning and unless the crops are better this year than they were last i am sure uncle henry cannot afford it  glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet upturned face of the loving little girl  bless your dear heart she said i am sure i can tell you of a way to get back to kansas then she added but if i do you must give me the golden cap  willingly exclaimed dorothy indeed it is of no use to me now and when you have it you can command the winged monkeys three times  and i think i shall need their service just those three times answered glinda smiling  dorothy then gave her the golden cap and the witch said to the scarecrow what will you do when dorothy has left us  i will return to the emerald city he replied for oz has made me its ruler and the people like me the only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the hammer-heads  by means of the golden cap i shall command the winged monkeys to carry you to the gates of the emerald city said glinda for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler  am i really wonderful asked the scarecrow  you are unusual replied glinda  turning to the tin woodman she asked what will become of you when dorothy leaves this country  he leaned on his axe and thought a moment then he said the winkies were very kind to me and wanted me to rule over them after the wicked witch died i am fond of the winkies and if i could get back again to the country of the west i should like nothing better than to rule over them forever  my second command to the winged monkeys said glinda will be that they carry you safely to the land of the winkies your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the scarecrow but you are really brighter than he is—when you are well polished—and i am sure you will rule the winkies wisely and well  then the witch looked at the big shaggy lion and asked when dorothy has returned to her own home what will become of you  over the hill of the hammer-heads he answered lies a grand old forest and all the beasts that live there have made me their king if i could only get back to this forest i would pass my life very happily there  my third command to the winged monkeys said glinda shall be to carry you to your forest then having used up the powers of the golden cap i shall give it to the king of the monkeys that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore  the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion now thanked the good witch earnestly for her kindness and dorothy exclaimed   you are certainly as good as you are beautiful but you have not yet told me how to get back to kansas  your silver shoes will carry you over the desert replied glinda if you had known their power you could have gone back to your aunt em the very first day you came to this country  but then i should not have had my wonderful brains cried the scarecrow i might have passed my whole life in the farmer’s cornfield  and i should not have had my lovely heart said the tin woodman i might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world  and i should have lived a coward forever declared the lion and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me  this is all true said dorothy and i am glad i was of use to these good friends but now that each of them has had what he most desired and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides i think i should like to go back to kansas  the silver shoes said the good witch have wonderful powers and one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps and each step will be made in the wink of an eye all you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go  if that is so said the child joyfully i will ask them to carry me back to kansas at once  she threw her arms around the lion’s neck and kissed him patting his big head tenderly then she kissed the tin woodman who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints but she hugged the soft stuffed body of the scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades  glinda the good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss and dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself  dorothy now took toto up solemnly in her arms and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times saying   take me home to aunt em   instantly she was whirling through the air so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears  the silver shoes took but three steps and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was  at length however she sat up and looked about her  good gracious she cried  for she was sitting on the broad kansas prairie and just before her was the new farmhouse uncle henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one uncle henry was milking the cows in the barnyard and toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn barking furiously  dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet for the silver shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air and were lost forever in the desert     chapter xxiv home again   aunt em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw dorothy running toward her  my darling child she cried folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses where in the world did you come from  from the land of oz said dorothy gravely and here is toto too and oh aunt em i’m so glad to be at home again"@"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"@"L.Frank Baum"
