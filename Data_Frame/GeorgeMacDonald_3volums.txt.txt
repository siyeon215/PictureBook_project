"at the back of the north wind   chapter i the hay-loft   i have been asked to tell you about the back of the north wind an old greek writer mentions a people who lived there and were so comfortable that they could not bear it any longer and drowned themselves my story is not the same as his i do not think herodotus had got the right account of the place i am going to tell you how it fared with a boy who went there  he lived in a low room over a coach-house and that was not by any means at the back of the north wind as his mother very well knew for one side of the room was built only of boards and the boards were so old that you might run a penknife through into the north wind and then let them settle between them which was the sharper i know that when you pulled it out again the wind would be after it like a cat after a mouse and you would know soon enough you were not at the back of the north wind still this room was not very cold except when the north wind blew stronger than usual  the room i have to do with now was always cold except in summer when the sun took the matter into his own hands indeed i am not sure whether i ought to call it a room at all for it was just a loft where they kept hay and straw and oats for the horses  and when little diamond but stop  i must tell you that his father who was a coachman had named him after a favourite horse and his mother had had no objection  when little diamond then lay there in bed he could hear the horses under him munching away in the dark or moving sleepily in their dreams for diamond's father had built him a bed in the loft with boards all round it because they had so little room in their own end over the coach-house and diamond's father put old diamond in the stall under the bed because he was a quiet horse and did not go to sleep standing but lay down like a reasonable creature but although he was a surprisingly reasonable creature yet when young diamond woke in the middle of the night and felt the bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind he could not help wondering whether if the wind should blow the house down and he were to fall through into the manger old diamond mightn't eat him up before he knew him in his night-gown and although old diamond was very quiet all night long yet when he woke he got up like an earthquake and then young diamond knew what o'clock it was or at least what was to be done next which was to go to sleep again as fast as he could  there was hay at his feet and hay at his head piled up in great trusses to the very roof indeed it was sometimes only through a little lane with several turnings which looked as if it had been sawn out for him that he could reach his bed at all for the stock of hay was of course always in a state either of slow ebb or of sudden flow sometimes the whole space of the loft with the little panes in the roof for the stars to look in would lie open before his open eyes as he lay in bed sometimes a yellow wall of sweet-smelling fibres closed up his view at the distance of half a yard sometimes when his mother had undressed him in her room and told him to trot to bed by himself he would creep into the heart of the hay and lie there thinking how cold it was outside in the wind and how warm it was inside there in his bed and how he could go to it when he pleased only he wouldn't just yet he would get a little colder first and ever as he grew colder his bed would grow warmer till at last he would scramble out of the hay shoot like an arrow into his bed cover himself up and snuggle down thinking what a happy boy he was he had not the least idea that the wind got in at a chink in the wall and blew about him all night for the back of his bed was only of boards an inch thick and on the other side of them was the north wind  now as i have already said these boards were soft and crumbly to be sure they were tarred on the outside yet in many places they were more like tinder than timber hence it happened that the soft part having worn away from about it little diamond found one night after he lay down that a knot had come out of one of them and that the wind was blowing in upon him in a cold and rather imperious fashion now he had no fancy for leaving things wrong that might be set right so he jumped out of bed again got a little strike of hay twisted it up folded it in the middle and having thus made it into a cork stuck it into the hole in the wall but the wind began to blow loud and angrily and as diamond was falling asleep out blew his cork and hit him on the nose just hard enough to wake him up quite and let him hear the wind whistling shrill in the hole he searched for his hay-cork found it stuck it in harder and was just dropping off once more when pop with an angry whistle behind it the cork struck him again this time on the cheek up he rose once more made a fresh stopple of hay and corked the hole severely but he was hardly down again before pop it came on his forehead he gave it up drew the clothes above his head and was soon fast asleep  although the next day was very stormy diamond forgot all about the hole for he was busy making a cave by the side of his mother's fire with a broken chair a three-legged stool and a blanket and then sitting in it his mother however discovered it and pasted a bit of brown paper over it so that when diamond had snuggled down the next night he had no occasion to think of it  presently however he lifted his head and listened who could that be talking to him the wind was rising again and getting very loud and full of rushes and whistles he was sure some one was talking and very near him too it was but he was not frightened for he had not yet learned how to be so he sat up and hearkened at last the voice which though quite gentle sounded a little angry appeared to come from the back of the bed he crept nearer to it and laid his ear against the wall then he heard nothing but the wind which sounded very loud indeed the moment however that he moved his head from the wall he heard the voice again close to his ear he felt about with his hand and came upon the piece of paper his mother had pasted over the hole against this he laid his ear and then he heard the voice quite distinctly there was in fact a little corner of the paper loose and through that as from a mouth in the wall the voice came  what do you mean little boy closing up my window  what window asked diamond  you stuffed hay into it three times last night i had to blow it out again three times  you can't mean this little hole it isn't a window it's a hole in my bed  i did not say it was a window  i said it was my window  but it can't be a window because windows are holes to see out of  well that's just what i made this window for  but you are outside  you can't want a window  you are quite mistaken windows are to see out of you say well i'm in my house and i want windows to see out of it  but you've made a window into my bed  well your mother has got three windows into my dancing room and you have three into my garret  but i heard father say when my mother wanted him to make a window through the wall that it was against the law for it would look into mr dyves's garden  the voice laughed  the law would have some trouble to catch me it said  but if it's not right you know said diamond that's no matter you shouldn't do it  i am so tall i am above that law said the voice  you must have a tall house then said diamond  yes a tall house  the clouds are inside it  dear me said diamond and thought a minute i think then you can hardly expect me to keep a window in my bed for you why don't you make a window into mr dyves's bed  nobody makes a window into an ash-pit said the voice rather sadly i like to see nice things out of my windows  but he must have a nicer bed than i have though mine is very nice so nice that i couldn't wish a better  it's not the bed i care about  it's what is in it but you just open that window  well mother says i shouldn't be disobliging but it's rather hard you see the north wind will blow right in my face if i do  i am the north wind  o-o-oh said diamond thoughtfully then will you promise not to blow on my face if i open your window  i can't promise that  but you'll give me the toothache mother's got it already  but what's to become of me without a window  i'm sure i don't know all i say is it will be worse for me than for you  no it will not you shall not be the worse for it i promise you that you will be much the better for it just you believe what i say and do as i tell you  well i can pull the clothes over my head said diamond and feeling with his little sharp nails he got hold of the open edge of the paper and tore it off at once  in came a long whistling spear of cold and struck his little naked chest he scrambled and tumbled in under the bedclothes and covered himself up  there was no paper now between him and the voice and he felt a little not frightened exactly i told you he had not learned that yet but rather queer for what a strange person this north wind must be that lived in the great house called out-of-doors i suppose  thought diamond and made windows into people's beds but the voice began again and he could hear it quite plainly even with his head under the bed-clothes it was a still more gentle voice now although six times as large and loud as it had been and he thought it sounded a little like his mother's  what is your name little boy it asked  diamond answered diamond under the bed-clothes  what a funny name  it's a very nice name returned its owner  i don't know that said the voice  well i do retorted diamond a little rudely  do you know to whom you are speaking  no said diamond  and indeed he did not for to know a person's name is not always to know the person's self  then i must not be angry with you you had better look and see though  diamond is a very pretty name persisted the boy vexed that it should not give satisfaction  diamond is a useless thing rather said the voice  that's not true diamond is very nice as big as two and so quiet all night and doesn't he make a jolly row in the morning getting upon his four great legs it's like thunder  you don't seem to know what a diamond is  oh don't i just diamond is a great and good horse and he sleeps right under me he is old diamond and i am young diamond or if you like it better for you're very particular mr north wind he's big diamond and i'm little diamond and i don't know which of us my father likes best  a beautiful laugh large but very soft and musical sounded somewhere beside him but diamond kept his head under the clothes  i'm not mr north wind said the voice  you told me that you were the north wind insisted diamond  i did not say mister north wind said the voice  well then i do for mother tells me i ought to be polite  then let me tell you i don't think it at all polite of you to say mister to me  well i didn't know better i'm very sorry  but you ought to know better  i don't know that  i do you can't say it's polite to lie there talking with your head under the bed-clothes and never look up to see what kind of person you are talking to i want you to come out with me  i want to go to sleep said diamond very nearly crying for he did not like to be scolded even when he deserved it  you shall sleep all the better to-morrow night  besides said diamond you are out in mr dyves's garden and i can't get there i can only get into our own yard  will you take your head out of the bed-clothes said the voice just a little angrily  no answered diamond half peevish half frightened  the instant he said the word a tremendous blast of wind crashed in a board of the wall and swept the clothes off diamond he started up in terror leaning over him was the large beautiful pale face of a woman her dark eyes looked a little angry for they had just begun to flash but a quivering in her sweet upper lip made her look as if she were going to cry what was the most strange was that away from her head streamed out her black hair in every direction so that the darkness in the hay-loft looked as if it were made of her hair but as diamond gazed at her in speechless amazement mingled with confidence for the boy was entranced with her mighty beauty her hair began to gather itself out of the darkness and fell down all about her again till her face looked out of the midst of it like a moon out of a cloud from her eyes came all the light by which diamond saw her face and her hair and that was all he did see of her yet the wind was over and gone  will you go with me now you little diamond i am sorry i was forced to be so rough with you said the lady  i will yes i will answered diamond holding out both his arms but he added dropping them how shall i get my clothes they are in mother's room and the door is locked  oh never mind your clothes you will not be cold i shall take care of that nobody is cold with the north wind  i thought everybody was said diamond  that is a great mistake most people make it however they are cold because they are not with the north wind but without it  if diamond had been a little older and had supposed himself a good deal wiser he would have thought the lady was joking but he was not older and did not fancy himself wiser and therefore understood her well enough again he stretched out his arms the lady's face drew back a little  follow me diamond she said  yes said diamond only a little ruefully  you're not afraid said the north wind  no ma'am but mother never would let me go without shoes  she never said anything about clothes so i dare say she wouldn't mind that  i know your mother very well said the lady she is a good woman i have visited her often i was with her when you were born i saw her laugh and cry both at once i love your mother diamond  how was it you did not know my name then ma'am please am i to say ma'am to you ma'am  one question at a time dear boy i knew your name quite well but i wanted to hear what you would say for it don't you remember that day when the man was finding fault with your name how i blew the window in  yes yes answered diamond eagerly our window opens like a door right over the coach-house door and the wind you ma'am came in and blew the bible out of the man's hands and the leaves went all flutter flutter on the floor and my mother picked it up and gave it back to him open and there    was your name in the bible the sixth stone in the high priest's breastplate  oh a stone was it said diamond i thought it had been a horse i did  never mind a horse is better than a stone any day well you see i know all about you and your mother  yes i will go with you  now for the next question  you're not to call me ma'am you must call me just my own name respectfully you know just north wind  well please north wind you are so beautiful i am quite ready to go with you  you must not be ready to go with everything beautiful all at once diamond  but what's beautiful can't be bad you're not bad north wind  no i'm not bad but sometimes beautiful things grow bad by doing bad and it takes some time for their badness to spoil their beauty so little boys may be mistaken if they go after things because they are beautiful  well i will go with you because you are beautiful and good too  ah but there's another thing diamond  what if i should look ugly without being bad look ugly myself because i am making ugly things beautiful what then  i don't quite understand you north wind you tell me what then  well i will tell you if you see me with my face all black don't be frightened if you see me flapping wings like a bat's as big as the whole sky don't be frightened if you hear me raging ten times worse than mrs bill the blacksmith's wife even if you see me looking in at people's windows like mrs eve dropper the gardener's wife you must believe that i am doing my work nay diamond if i change into a serpent or a tiger you must not let go your hold of me for my hand will never change in yours if you keep a good hold if you keep a hold you will know who i am all the time even when you look at me and can't see me the least like the north wind i may look something very awful do you understand  quite well said little diamond  come along then said north wind and disappeared behind the mountain of hay  diamond crept out of bed and followed her     chapter ii the lawn   when diamond got round the corner of the hay for a moment he hesitated the stair by which he would naturally have gone down to the door was at the other side of the loft and looked very black indeed for it was full of north wind's hair as she descended before him and just beside him was the ladder going straight down into the stable up which his father always came to fetch the hay for diamond's dinner through the opening in the floor the faint gleam of the-stable lantern was enticing and diamond thought he would run down that way  the stair went close past the loose-box in which diamond the horse lived when diamond the boy was half-way down he remembered that it was of no use to go this way for the stable-door was locked but at the same moment there was horse diamond's great head poked out of his box on to the ladder for he knew boy diamond although he was in his night-gown and wanted him to pull his ears for him this diamond did very gently for a minute or so and patted and stroked his neck too and kissed the big horse and had begun to take the bits of straw and hay out of his mane when all at once he recollected that the lady north wind was waiting for him in the yard  good night diamond he said and darted up the ladder across the loft and down the stair to the door but when he got out into the yard there was no lady  now it is always a dreadful thing to think there is somebody and find nobody children in particular have not made up their minds to it they generally cry at nobody especially when they wake up at night but it was an especial disappointment to diamond for his little heart had been beating with joy  the face of the north wind was so grand to have a lady like that for a friend with such long hair too why it was longer than twenty diamonds' tails she was gone and there he stood with his bare feet on the stones of the paved yard  it was a clear night overhead and the stars were shining orion in particular was making the most of his bright belt and golden sword but the moon was only a poor thin crescent there was just one great jagged black and gray cloud in the sky with a steep side to it like a precipice and the moon was against this side and looked as if she had tumbled off the top of the cloud-hill and broken herself in rolling down the precipice she did not seem comfortable for she was looking down into the deep pit waiting for her at least that was what diamond thought as he stood for a moment staring at her but he was quite wrong for the moon was not afraid and there was no pit she was going down into for there were no sides to it and a pit without sides to it is not a pit at all diamond however had not been out so late before in all his life and things looked so strange about him just as if he had got into fairyland of which he knew quite as much as anybody for his mother had no money to buy books to set him wrong on the subject i have seen this world only sometimes just now and then you know look as strange as ever i saw fairyland but i confess that i have not yet seen fairyland at its best i am always going to see it so some time but if you had been out in the face and not at the back of the north wind on a cold rather frosty night and in your night-gown you would have felt it all quite as strange as diamond did he cried a little just a little he was so disappointed to lose the lady  of course you little man wouldn't have done that but for my part i don't mind people crying so much as i mind what they cry about and how they cry whether they cry quietly like ladies and gentlemen or go shrieking like vulgar emperors or ill-natured cooks for all emperors are not gentlemen and all cooks are not ladies nor all queens and princesses for that matter either  but it can't be denied that a little gentle crying does one good it did diamond good for as soon as it was over he was a brave boy again  she shan't say it was my fault anyhow said diamond i daresay she is hiding somewhere to see what i will do i will look for her  so he went round the end of the stable towards the kitchen-garden but the moment he was clear of the shelter of the stable sharp as a knife came the wind against his little chest and his bare legs still he would look in the kitchen-garden and went on but when he got round the weeping-ash that stood in the corner the wind blew much stronger and it grew stronger and stronger till he could hardly fight against it and it was so cold all the flashy spikes of the stars seemed to have got somehow into the wind then he thought of what the lady had said about people being cold because they were not with the north wind how it was that he should have guessed what she meant at that very moment i cannot tell but i have observed that the most wonderful thing in the world is how people come to understand anything he turned his back to the wind and trotted again towards the yard whereupon strange to say it blew so much more gently against his calves than it had blown against his shins that he began to feel almost warm by contrast  you must not think it was cowardly of diamond to turn his back to the wind  he did so only because he thought lady north wind had said something like telling him to do so if she had said to him that he must hold his face to it diamond would have held his face to it but the most foolish thing is to fight for no good and to please nobody  well it was just as if the wind was pushing diamond along if he turned round it grew very sharp on his legs especially and so he thought the wind might really be lady north wind though he could not see her and he had better let her blow him wherever she pleased so she blew and blew and he went and went until he found himself standing at a door in a wall which door led from the yard into a little belt of shrubbery flanking mr coleman's house mr coleman was his father's master and the owner of diamond he opened the door and went through the shrubbery and out into the middle of the lawn still hoping to find north wind the soft grass was very pleasant to his bare feet and felt warm after the stones of the yard but the lady was nowhere to be seen then he began to think that after all he must have done wrong and she was offended with him for not following close after her but staying to talk to the horse which certainly was neither wise nor polite  there he stood in the middle of the lawn the wind blowing his night-gown till it flapped like a loose sail the stars were very shiny over his head but they did not give light enough to show that the grass was green and diamond stood alone in the strange night which looked half solid all about him he began to wonder whether he was in a dream or not it was important to determine this for thought diamond if i am in a dream i am safe in my bed and i needn't cry but if i'm not in a dream i'm out here and perhaps i had better cry or at least i'm not sure whether i can help it he came to the conclusion however that whether he was in a dream or not there could be no harm in not crying for a little while longer  he could begin whenever he liked  the back of mr coleman's house was to the lawn and one of the drawing-room windows looked out upon it the ladies had not gone to bed for the light was still shining in that window but they had no idea that a little boy was standing on the lawn in his night-gown or they would have run out in a moment and as long as he saw that light diamond could not feel quite lonely he stood staring not at the great warrior orion in the sky nor yet at the disconsolate neglected moon going down in the west but at the drawing-room window with the light shining through its green curtains he had been in that room once or twice that he could remember at christmas times for the colemans were kind people though they did not care much about children  all at once the light went nearly out  he could only see a glimmer of the shape of the window then indeed he felt that he was left alone it was so dreadful to be out in the night after everybody was gone to bed that was more than he could bear he burst out crying in good earnest beginning with a wail like that of the wind when it is waking up  perhaps you think this was very foolish for could he not go home to his own bed again when he liked yes but it looked dreadful to him to creep up that stair again and lie down in his bed again and know that north wind's window was open beside him and she gone and he might never see her again he would be just as lonely there as here nay it would be much worse if he had to think that the window was nothing but a hole in the wall  at the very moment when he burst out crying the old nurse who had grown to be one of the family for she had not gone away when miss coleman did not want any more nursing came to the back door which was of glass to close the shutters she thought she heard a cry and peering out with a hand on each side of her eyes like diamond's blinkers she saw something white on the lawn too old and too wise to be frightened she opened the door and went straight towards the white thing to see what it was and when diamond saw her coming he was not frightened either though mrs crump was a little cross sometimes for there is a good kind of crossness that is only disagreeable and there is a bad kind of crossness that is very nasty indeed so she came up with her neck stretched out and her head at the end of it and her eyes foremost of all like a snail's peering into the night to see what it could be that went on glimmering white before her when she did see she made a great exclamation and threw up her hands then without a word for she thought diamond was walking in his sleep she caught hold of him and led him towards the house he made no objection for he was just in the mood to be grateful for notice of any sort and mrs crump led him straight into the drawing-room  now from the neglect of the new housemaid the fire in miss coleman's bedroom had gone out and her mother had told her to brush her hair by the drawing-room fire a disorderly proceeding which a mother's wish could justify the young lady was very lovely though not nearly so beautiful as north wind and her hair was extremely long for it came down to her knees though that was nothing at all to north wind's hair yet when she looked round with her hair all about her as diamond entered he thought for one moment that it was north wind and pulling his hand from mrs crump's he stretched out his arms and ran towards miss coleman she was so pleased that she threw down her brush and almost knelt on the floor to receive him in her arms he saw the next moment that she was not lady north wind but she looked so like her he could not help running into her arms and bursting into tears afresh mrs crump said the poor child had walked out in his sleep and diamond thought she ought to know and did not contradict her for anything he knew it might be so indeed he let them talk on about him and said nothing and when after their astonishment was over and miss coleman had given him a sponge-cake it was decreed that mrs crump should take him to his mother he was quite satisfied  his mother had to get out of bed to open the door when mrs crump knocked she was indeed surprised to see her boy and having taken him in her arms and carried him to his bed returned and had a long confabulation with mrs crump for they were still talking when diamond fell fast asleep and could hear them no longer     chapter iii old diamond   diamond woke very early in the morning and thought what a curious dream he had had but the memory grew brighter and brighter in his head until it did not look altogether like a dream and he began to doubt whether he had not really been abroad in the wind last night he came to the conclusion that if he had really been brought home to his mother by mrs crump she would say something to him about it and that would settle the matter then he got up and dressed himself but finding that his father and mother were not yet stirring he went down the ladder to the stable there he found that even old diamond was not awake yet for he as well as young diamond always got up the moment he woke and now he was lying as flat as a horse could lie upon his nice trim bed of straw  i'll give old diamond a surprise thought the boy and creeping up very softly before the horse knew he was astride of his back then it was young diamond's turn to have more of a surprise than he had expected for as with an earthquake with a rumbling and a rocking hither and thither a sprawling of legs and heaving as of many backs young diamond found himself hoisted up in the air with both hands twisted in the horse's mane the next instant old diamond lashed out with both his hind legs and giving one cry of terror young diamond found himself lying on his neck with his arms as far round it as they would go but then the horse stood as still as a stone except that he lifted his head gently up to let the boy slip down to his back for when he heard young diamond's cry he knew that there was nothing to kick about for young diamond was a good boy and old diamond was a good horse and the one was all right on the back of the other  as soon as diamond had got himself comfortable on the saddle place the horse began pulling at the hay and the boy began thinking he had never mounted diamond himself before and he had never got off him without being lifted down so he sat while the horse ate wondering how he was to reach the ground  but while he meditated his mother woke and her first thought was to see her boy she had visited him twice during the night and found him sleeping quietly now his bed was empty and she was frightened  diamond diamond where are you diamond she called out  diamond turned his head where he sat like a knight on his steed in enchanted stall and cried aloud   here mother  where diamond she returned  here mother on diamond's back  she came running to the ladder and peeping down saw him aloft on the great horse  come down diamond she said  i can't answered diamond  how did you get up asked his mother  quite easily answered he but when i got up diamond would get up too and so here i am  his mother thought he had been walking in his sleep again and hurried down the ladder she did not much like going up to the horse for she had not been used to horses but she would have gone into a lion's den not to say a horse's stall to help her boy so she went and lifted him off diamond's back and felt braver all her life after she carried him in her arms up to her room but afraid of frightening him at his own sleep-walking as she supposed it said nothing about last night before the next day was over diamond had almost concluded the whole adventure a dream  for a week his mother watched him very carefully going into the loft several times a night as often in fact as she woke every time she found him fast asleep  all that week it was hard weather the grass showed white in the morning with the hoar-frost which clung like tiny comfits to every blade and as diamond's shoes were not good and his mother had not quite saved up enough money to get him the new pair she so much wanted for him she would not let him run out he played all his games over and over indoors especially that of driving two chairs harnessed to the baby's cradle and if they did not go very fast they went as fast as could be expected of the best chairs in the world although one of them had only three legs and the other only half a back  at length his mother brought home his new shoes and no sooner did she find they fitted him than she told him he might run out in the yard and amuse himself for an hour  the sun was going down when he flew from the door like a bird from its cage all the world was new to him a great fire of sunset burned on the top of the gate that led from the stables to the house above the fire in the sky lay a large lake of green light above that a golden cloud and over that the blue of the wintry heavens and diamond thought that next to his own home he had never seen any place he would like so much to live in as that sky for it is not fine things that make home a nice place but your mother and your father  as he was looking at the lovely colours the gates were thrown open and there was old diamond and his friend in the carriage dancing with impatience to get at their stalls and their oats and in they came diamond was not in the least afraid of his father driving over him but careful not to spoil the grand show he made with his fine horses and his multitudinous cape with a red edge to every fold he slipped out of the way and let him dash right on to the stables to be quite safe he had to step into the recess of the door that led from the yard to the shrubbery  as he stood there he remembered how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream and once more he was almost sure that it was no dream at all events he would go in and see whether things looked at all now as they did then he opened the door and passed through the little belt of shrubbery not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn even the brave old chrysanthemums and christmas roses had passed away before the frost what yes there was one he ran and knelt down to look at it  it was a primrose a dwarfish thing but perfect in shape a baby-wonder as he stooped his face to see it close a little wind began to blow and two or three long leaves that stood up behind the flower shook and waved and quivered but the primrose lay still in the green hollow looking up at the sky and not seeming to know that the wind was blowing at all it was just a one eye that the dull black wintry earth had opened to look at the sky with all at once diamond thought it was saying its prayers and he ought not to be staring at it so he ran to the stable to see his father make diamond's bed then his father took him in his arms carried him up the ladder and set him down at the table where they were going to have their tea  miss is very poorly said diamond's father mis'ess has been to the doctor with her to-day and she looked very glum when she came out again i was a-watching of them to see what doctor had said  and didn't miss look glum too asked his mother  not half as glum as mis'ess returned the coachman you see   but he lowered his voice and diamond could not make out more than a word here and there for diamond's father was not only one of the finest of coachmen to look at and one of the best of drivers but one of the most discreet of servants as well therefore he did not talk about family affairs to any one but his wife whom he had proved better than himself long ago and was careful that even diamond should hear nothing he could repeat again concerning master and his family  it was bed-time soon and diamond went to bed and fell fast asleep  he awoke all at once in the dark  open the window diamond said a voice  now diamond's mother had once more pasted up north wind's window  are you north wind said diamond  i don't hear you blowing  no but you hear me talking open the window for i haven't overmuch time  yes returned diamond but please north wind where's the use you left me all alone last time  he had got up on his knees and was busy with his nails once more at the paper over the hole in the wall for now that north wind spoke again he remembered all that had taken place before as distinctly as if it had happened only last night  yes but that was your fault returned north wind i had work to do and besides a gentleman should never keep a lady waiting  but i'm not a gentleman said diamond scratching away at the paper  i hope you won't say so ten years after this  i'm going to be a coachman and a coachman is not a gentleman  persisted diamond  we call your father a gentleman in our house said north wind  he doesn't call himself one said diamond  that's of no consequence  every man ought to be a gentleman and your father is one  diamond was so pleased to hear this that he scratched at the paper like ten mice and getting hold of the edge of it tore it off the next instant a young girl glided across the bed and stood upon the floor  oh dear said diamond quite dismayed i didn't know who are you please  i'm north wind  are you really  yes make haste  but you're no bigger than me  do you think i care about how big or how little i am didn't you see me this evening i was less then  no where was you  behind the leaves of the primrose didn't you see them blowing  yes  make haste then if you want to go with me  but you are not big enough to take care of me i think you are only miss north wind  i am big enough to show you the way anyhow but if you won't come why you must stay  i must dress myself i didn't mind with a grown lady but i couldn't go with a little girl in my night-gown  very well i'm not in such a hurry as i was the other night dress as fast as you can and i'll go and shake the primrose leaves till you come  don't hurt it said diamond  north wind broke out in a little laugh like the breaking of silver bubbles and was gone in a moment diamond saw for it was a starlit night and the mass of hay was at a low ebb now the gleam of something vanishing down the stair and springing out of bed dressed himself as fast as ever he could then he crept out into the yard through the door in the wall and away to the primrose behind it stood north wind leaning over it and looking at the flower as if she had been its mother  come along she said jumping up and holding out her hand  diamond took her hand it was cold but so pleasant and full of life it was better than warm she led him across the garden with one bound she was on the top of the wall diamond was left at the foot  stop stop he cried please i can't jump like that  you don't try said north wind who from the top looked down a foot taller than before  give me your hand again and i will try said diamond  she reached down diamond laid hold of her hand gave a great spring and stood beside her  this is nice he said  another bound and they stood in the road by the river it was full tide and the stars were shining clear in its depths for it lay still waiting for the turn to run down again to the sea they walked along its side but they had not walked far before its surface was covered with ripples and the stars had vanished from its bosom  and north wind was now tall as a full-grown girl her hair was flying about her head and the wind was blowing a breeze down the river but she turned aside and went up a narrow lane and as she went her hair fell down around her  i have some rather disagreeable work to do to-night she said before i get out to sea and i must set about it at once the disagreeable work must be looked after first  so saying she laid hold of diamond and began to run gliding along faster and faster diamond kept up with her as well as he could she made many turnings and windings apparently because it was not quite easy to get him over walls and houses once they ran through a hall where they found back and front doors open at the foot of the stair north wind stood still and diamond hearing a great growl started in terror and there instead of north wind was a huge wolf by his side he let go his hold in dismay and the wolf bounded up the stair the windows of the house rattled and shook as if guns were firing and the sound of a great fall came from above diamond stood with white face staring up at the landing  surely he thought north wind can't be eating one of the children  coming to himself all at once he rushed after her with his little fist clenched there were ladies in long trains going up and down the stairs and gentlemen in white neckties attending on them who stared at him but none of them were of the people of the house and they said nothing before he reached the head of the stair however north wind met him took him by the hand and hurried down and out of the house  i hope you haven't eaten a baby north wind said diamond very solemnly  north wind laughed merrily and went tripping on faster her grassy robe swept and swirled about her steps and wherever it passed over withered leaves they went fleeing and whirling in spirals and running on their edges like wheels all about her feet  no she said at last i did not eat a baby you would not have had to ask that foolish question if you had not let go your hold of me you would have seen how i served a nurse that was calling a child bad names and telling her she was wicked she had been drinking i saw an ugly gin bottle in a cupboard  and you frightened her said diamond  i believe so answered north wind laughing merrily i flew at her throat and she tumbled over on the floor with such a crash that they ran in she'll be turned away to-morrow and quite time if they knew as much as i do  but didn't you frighten the little one  she never saw me the woman would not have seen me either if she had not been wicked  oh said diamond dubiously  why should you see things returned north wind that you wouldn't understand or know what to do with good people see good things bad people bad things  then are you a bad thing  no for you see me diamond dear said the girl and she looked down at him and diamond saw the loving eyes of the great lady beaming from the depths of her falling hair  i had to make myself look like a bad thing before she could see me if i had put on any other shape than a wolf's she would not have seen me for that is what is growing to be her own shape inside of her  i don't know what you mean said diamond but i suppose it's all right  they were now climbing the slope of a grassy ascent it was primrose hill in fact although diamond had never heard of it the moment they reached the top north wind stood and turned her face towards london the stars were still shining clear and cold overhead there was not a cloud to be seen the air was sharp but diamond did not find it cold  now said the lady whatever you do do not let my hand go i might have lost you the last time only i was not in a hurry then  now i am in a hurry  yet she stood still for a moment     chapter iv north wind   and as she stood looking towards london diamond saw that she was trembling  are you cold north wind he asked  no diamond she answered looking down upon him with a smile i am only getting ready to sweep one of my rooms those careless greedy untidy children make it in such a mess  as she spoke he could have told by her voice if he had not seen with his eyes that she was growing larger and larger her head went up and up towards the stars and as she grew still trembling through all her body her hair also grew longer and longer and lifted itself from her head and went out in black waves the next moment however it fell back around her and she grew less and less till she was only a tall woman then she put her hands behind her head and gathered some of her hair and began weaving and knotting it together when she had done she bent down her beautiful face close to his and said   diamond i am afraid you would not keep hold of me and if i were to drop you i don't know what might happen so i have been making a place for you in my hair come  diamond held out his arms for with that grand face looking at him he believed like a baby she took him in her hands threw him over her shoulder and said get in diamond  and diamond parted her hair with his hands crept between and feeling about soon found the woven nest it was just like a pocket or like the shawl in which gipsy women carry their children north wind put her hands to her back felt all about the nest and finding it safe said   are you comfortable diamond  yes indeed answered diamond  the next moment he was rising in the air north wind grew towering up to the place of the clouds her hair went streaming out from her till it spread like a mist over the stars she flung herself abroad in space  diamond held on by two of the twisted ropes which parted and interwoven formed his shelter for he could not help being a little afraid as soon as he had come to himself he peeped through the woven meshes for he did not dare to look over the top of the nest the earth was rushing past like a river or a sea below him trees and water and green grass hurried away beneath a great roar of wild animals rose as they rushed over the zoological gardens mixed with a chattering of monkeys and a screaming of birds but it died away in a moment behind them and now there was nothing but the roofs of houses sweeping along like a great torrent of stones and rocks chimney-pots fell and tiles flew from the roofs but it looked to him as if they were left behind by the roofs and the chimneys as they scudded away there was a great roaring for the wind was dashing against london like a sea but at north wind's back diamond of course felt nothing of it all he was in a perfect calm he could hear the sound of it that was all  by and by he raised himself and looked over the edge of his nest there were the houses rushing up and shooting away below him like a fierce torrent of rocks instead of water then he looked up to the sky but could see no stars they were hidden by the blinding masses of the lady's hair which swept between he began to wonder whether she would hear him if he spoke he would try  please north wind he said what is that noise  from high over his head came the voice of north wind answering him gently   the noise of my besom i am the old woman that sweeps the cobwebs from the sky only i'm busy with the floor now  what makes the houses look as if they were running away  i am sweeping so fast over them  but please north wind i knew london was very big but i didn't know it was so big as this it seems as if we should never get away from it  we are going round and round else we should have left it long ago  is this the way you sweep north wind  yes i go round and round with my great besom  please would you mind going a little slower for i want to see the streets  you won't see much now  why  because i have nearly swept all the people home  oh i forgot said diamond and was quiet after that for he did not want to be troublesome  but she dropped a little towards the roofs of the houses and diamond could see down into the streets there were very few people about though the lamps flickered and flared again but nobody seemed to want them  suddenly diamond espied a little girl coming along a street she was dreadfully blown by the wind and a broom she was trailing behind her was very troublesome it seemed as if the wind had a spite at her it kept worrying her like a wild beast and tearing at her rags she was so lonely there  oh please north wind he cried won't you help that little girl  no diamond i mustn't leave my work  but why shouldn't you be kind to her  i am kind to her i am sweeping the wicked smells away  but you're kinder to me dear north wind why shouldn't you be as kind to her as you are to me  there are reasons diamond everybody can't be done to all the same everybody is not ready for the same thing  but i don't see why i should be kinder used than she  do you think nothing's to be done but what you can see diamond you silly it's all right of course you can help her if you like you've got nothing particular to do at this moment i have  oh do let me help her then but you won't be able to wait perhaps  no i can't wait you must do it yourself and mind the wind will get a hold of you too  don't you want me to help her north wind  not without having some idea what will happen if you break down and cry that won't be much of a help to her and it will make a goose of little diamond  i want to go said diamond only there's just one thing how am i to get home  if you're anxious about that perhaps you had better go with me i am bound to take you home again if you do  there cried diamond who was still looking after the little girl i'm sure the wind will blow her over and perhaps kill her do let me go  they had been sweeping more slowly along the line of the street there was a lull in the roaring  well though i cannot promise to take you home said north wind as she sank nearer and nearer to the tops of the houses i can promise you it will be all right in the end you will get home somehow have you made up your mind what to do  yes to help the little girl said diamond firmly  the same moment north wind dropt into the street and stood only a tall lady but with her hair flying up over the housetops she put her hands to her back took diamond and set him down in the street the same moment he was caught in the fierce coils of the blast and all but blown away north wind stepped back a step and at once towered in stature to the height of the houses a chimney-pot clashed at diamond's feet he turned in terror but it was to look for the little girl and when he turned again the lady had vanished and the wind was roaring along the street as if it had been the bed of an invisible torrent the little girl was scudding before the blast her hair flying too and behind her she dragged her broom her little legs were going as fast as ever they could to keep her from falling diamond crept into the shelter of a doorway thinking to stop her but she passed him like a bird crying gently and pitifully  stop stop little girl shouted diamond starting in pursuit  i can't wailed the girl the wind won't leave go of me  diamond could run faster than she and he had no broom in a few moments he had caught her by the frock but it tore in his hand and away went the little girl so he had to run again and this time he ran so fast that he got before her and turning round caught her in his arms when down they went both together which made the little girl laugh in the midst of her crying  where are you going asked diamond rubbing the elbow that had stuck farthest out the arm it belonged to was twined round a lamp-post as he stood between the little girl and the wind  home she said gasping for breath  then i will go with you said diamond  and then they were silent for a while for the wind blew worse than ever and they had both to hold on to the lamp-post  where is your crossing asked the girl at length  i don't sweep answered diamond  what do you do then asked she you ain't big enough for most things  i don't know what i do do answered he feeling rather ashamed nothing i suppose my father's mr coleman's coachman  have you a father she said staring at him as if a boy with a father was a natural curiosity  yes haven't you returned diamond  no nor mother neither old sal's all i've got and she began to cry again  i wouldn't go to her if she wasn't good to me said diamond  but you must go somewheres  move on said the voice of a policeman behind them  i told you so said the girl you must go somewheres they're always at it  but old sal doesn't beat you does she  i wish she would  what do you mean asked diamond quite bewildered  she would if she was my mother but she wouldn't lie abed a-cuddlin' of her ugly old bones and laugh to hear me crying at the door  you don't mean she won't let you in to-night  it'll be a good chance if she does  why are you out so late then asked diamond  my crossing's a long way off at the west end and i had been indulgin' in door-steps and mewses  we'd better have a try anyhow said diamond come along  as he spoke diamond thought he caught a glimpse of north wind turning a corner in front of them and when they turned the corner too they found it quiet there but he saw nothing of the lady  now you lead me he said taking her hand and i'll take care of you  the girl withdrew her hand but only to dry her eyes with her frock for the other had enough to do with her broom she put it in his again and led him turning after turning until they stopped at a cellar-door in a very dirty lane there she knocked  i shouldn't like to live here said diamond  oh yes you would if you had nowhere else to go to answered the girl i only wish we may get in  i don't want to go in said diamond  where do you mean to go then  home to my home  where's that  i don't exactly know  then you're worse off than i am  oh no for north wind  began diamond and stopped he hardly knew why  what said the girl as she held her ear to the door listening  but diamond did not reply neither did old sal  i told you so said the girl she is wide awake hearkening but we don't get in  what will you do then asked diamond  move on she answered  where  oh anywheres bless you i'm used to it  hadn't you better come home with me then  that's a good joke when you don't know where it is come on  but where  oh nowheres in particular come on  diamond obeyed the wind had now fallen considerably they wandered on and on turning in this direction and that without any reason for one way more than another until they had got out of the thick of the houses into a waste kind of place by this time they were both very tired diamond felt a good deal inclined to cry and thought he had been very silly to get down from the back of north wind not that he would have minded it if he had done the girl any good but he thought he had been of no use to her he was mistaken there for she was far happier for having diamond with her than if she had been wandering about alone she did not seem so tired as he was  do let us rest a bit said diamond  let's see she answered there's something like a railway there perhaps there's an open arch  they went towards it and found one and better still there was an empty barrel lying under the arch  hallo here we are said the girl a barrel's the jolliest bed going on the tramp i mean we'll have forty winks and then go on again  she crept in and diamond crept in beside her they put their arms round each other and when he began to grow warm diamond's courage began to come back  this is jolly he said i'm so glad  i don't think so much of it said the girl i'm used to it i suppose but i can't think how a kid like you comes to be out all alone this time o' night  she called him a kid but she was not really a month older than he was only she had had to work for her bread and that so soon makes people older  but i shouldn't have been out so late if i hadn't got down to help you said diamond north wind is gone home long ago  i think you must ha' got out o' one o' them hidget asylms said the girl you said something about the north wind afore that i couldn't get the rights of  so now for the sake of his character diamond had to tell her the whole story  she did not believe a word of it she said he wasn't such a flat as to believe all that bosh but as she spoke there came a great blast of wind through the arch and set the barrel rolling so they made haste to get out of it for they had no notion of being rolled over and over as if they had been packed tight and wouldn't hurt like a barrel of herrings  i thought we should have had a sleep said diamond but i can't say i'm very sleepy after all come let's go on again  they wandered on and on sometimes sitting on a door-step but always turning into lanes or fields when they had a chance  they found themselves at last on a rising ground that sloped rather steeply on the other side it was a waste kind of spot below bounded by an irregular wall with a few doors in it outside lay broken things in general from garden rollers to flower-pots and wine-bottles but the moment they reached the brow of the rising ground a gust of wind seized them and blew them down hill as fast as they could run nor could diamond stop before he went bang against one of the doors in the wall to his dismay it burst open when they came to themselves they peeped in it was the back door of a garden  ah ah cried diamond after staring for a few moments i thought so north wind takes nobody in here i am in master's garden i tell you what little girl you just bore a hole in old sal's wall and put your mouth to it and say 'please north wind mayn't i go out with you' and then you'll see what'll come  i daresay i shall but i'm out in the wind too often already to want more of it  i said with the north wind not in it  it's all one  it's not all one  it is all one  but i know best  and i know better i'll box your ears said the girl  diamond got very angry but he remembered that even if she did box his ears he musn't box hers again for she was a girl and all that boys must do if girls are rude is to go away and leave them so he went in at the door  good-bye mister said the girl  this brought diamond to his senses  i'm sorry i was cross he said come in and my mother will give you some breakfast  no thank you i must be off to my crossing it's morning now  i'm very sorry for you said diamond  well it is a life to be tired of what with old sal and so many holes in my shoes  i wonder you're so good i should kill myself  oh no you wouldn't when i think of it i always want to see what's coming next and so i always wait till next is over well i suppose there's somebody happy somewheres but it ain't in them carriages oh my how they do look sometimes fit to bite your head off good-bye  she ran up the hill and disappeared behind it then diamond shut the door as he best could and ran through the kitchen-garden to the stable and wasn't he glad to get into his own blessed bed again     chapter v the summer-house   diamond said nothing to his mother about his adventures he had half a notion that north wind was a friend of his mother and that if she did not know all about it at least she did not mind his going anywhere with the lady of the wind at the same time he doubted whether he might not appear to be telling stories if he told all especially as he could hardly believe it himself when he thought about it in the middle of the day although when the twilight was once half-way on to night he had no doubt about it at least for the first few days after he had been with her the girl that swept the crossing had certainly refused to believe him besides he felt sure that north wind would tell him if he ought to speak  it was some time before he saw the lady of the wind again indeed nothing remarkable took place in diamond's history until the following week this was what happened then diamond the horse wanted new shoes and diamond's father took him out of the stable and was just getting on his back to ride him to the forge when he saw his little boy standing by the pump and looking at him wistfully then the coachman took his foot out of the stirrup left his hold of the mane and bridle came across to his boy lifted him up and setting him on the horse's back told him to sit up like a man he then led away both diamonds together  the boy atop felt not a little tremulous as the great muscles that lifted the legs of the horse knotted and relaxed against his legs and he cowered towards the withers grasping with his hands the bit of mane worn short by the collar but when his father looked back at him saying once more sit up diamond he let the mane go and sat up notwithstanding that the horse thinking i suppose that his master had said to him come up diamond stepped out faster for both the diamonds were just grandly obedient and diamond soon found that as he was obedient to his father so the horse was obedient to him for he had not ridden far before he found courage to reach forward and catch hold of the bridle and when his father whose hand was upon it felt the boy pull it towards him he looked up and smiled and well pleased let go his hold and left diamond to guide diamond and the boy soon found that he could do so perfectly it was a grand thing to be able to guide a great beast like that and another discovery he made was that in order to guide the horse he had in a measure to obey the horse first if he did not yield his body to the motions of the horse's body he could not guide him he must fall off  the blacksmith lived at some distance deeper into london as they crossed the angle of a square diamond who was now quite comfortable on his living throne was glancing this way and that in a gentle pride when he saw a girl sweeping a crossing scuddingly before a lady the lady was his father's mistress mrs coleman and the little girl was she for whose sake he had got off north wind's back he drew diamond's bridle in eager anxiety to see whether her outstretched hand would gather a penny from mrs coleman but she had given one at the last crossing and the hand returned only to grasp its broom diamond could not bear it he had a penny in his pocket a gift of the same lady the day before and he tumbled off his horse to give it to the girl he tumbled off i say for he did tumble when he reached the ground but he got up in an instant and ran searching his pocket as he ran she made him a pretty courtesy when he offered his treasure but with a bewildered stare she thought first  then he was on the back of the north wind after all but looking up at the sound of the horse's feet on the paved crossing she changed her idea saying to herself north wind is his father's horse that's the secret of it why couldn't he say so and she had a mind to refuse the penny but his smile put it all right and she not only took his penny but put it in her mouth with a thank you mister did they wollop you then  oh no answered diamond they never wollops me  lor said the little girl and was speechless  meantime his father looking up and seeing the horse's back bare suffered a pang of awful dread but the next moment catching sight of him took him up and put him on saying   don't get off again diamond the horse might have put his foot on you  no father answered the boy and rode on in majestic safety  the summer drew near warm and splendid miss coleman was a little better in health and sat a good deal in the garden one day she saw diamond peeping through the shrubbery and called him he talked to her so frankly that she often sent for him after that and by degrees it came about that he had leave to run in the garden as he pleased he never touched any of the flowers or blossoms for he was not like some boys who cannot enjoy a thing without pulling it to pieces and so preventing every one from enjoying it after them  a week even makes such a long time in a child's life that diamond had begun once more to feel as if north wind were a dream of some far-off year  one hot evening he had been sitting with the young mistress as they called her in a little summer-house at the bottom of the lawn a wonderful thing for beauty the boy thought for a little window in the side of it was made of coloured glass it grew dusky and the lady began to feel chill and went in leaving the boy in the summer-house he sat there gazing out at a bed of tulips which although they had closed for the night could not go quite asleep for the wind that kept waving them about all at once he saw a great bumble-bee fly out of one of the tulips  there that is something done said a voice a gentle merry childish voice but so tiny at last it was i thought he would have had to stay there all night poor fellow i did  diamond could not tell whether the voice was near or far away it was so small and yet so clear he had never seen a fairy but he had heard of such and he began to look all about for one and there was the tiniest creature sliding down the stem of the tulip  are you the fairy that herds the bees he asked going out of the summer-house and down on his knees on the green shore of the tulip-bed  i'm not a fairy answered the little creature  how do you know that  it would become you better to ask how you are to know it  you've just told me  yes but what's the use of knowing a thing only because you're told it  well how am i to know you are not a fairy you do look very like one  in the first place fairies are much bigger than you see me  oh said diamond reflectively i thought they were very little  but they might be tremendously bigger than i am and yet not very big why i could be six times the size i am and not be very huge besides a fairy can't grow big and little at will though the nursery-tales do say so  they don't know better you stupid diamond have you never seen me before  and as she spoke a moan of wind bent the tulips almost to the ground and the creature laid her hand on diamond's shoulder in a moment he knew that it was north wind  i am very stupid he said but i never saw you so small before not even when you were nursing the primrose  must you see me every size that can be measured before you know me diamond  but how could i think it was you taking care of a great stupid bumble-bee  the more stupid he was the more need he had to be taken care of what with sucking honey and trying to open the door he was nearly dated and when it opened in the morning to let the sun see the tulip's heart what would the sun have thought to find such a stupid thing lying there with wings too  but how do you have time to look after bees  i don't look after bees i had this one to look after it was hard work though  hard work why you could blow a chimney down or or a boy's cap off  said diamond  both are easier than to blow a tulip open but i scarcely know the difference between hard and easy i am always able for what i have to do when i see my work i just rush at it and it is done but i mustn't chatter i have got to sink a ship to-night  sink a ship what with men in it  yes and women too  how dreadful i wish you wouldn't talk so  it is rather dreadful but it is my work i must do it  i hope you won't ask me to go with you  no i won't ask you but you must come for all that  i won't then  won't you and north wind grew a tall lady and looked him in the eyes and diamond said   please take me you cannot be cruel  no i could not be cruel if i would i can do nothing cruel although i often do what looks like cruel to those who do not know what i really am doing the people they say i drown i only carry away to to to well the back of the north wind that is what they used to call it long ago only i never saw the place  how can you carry them there if you never saw it  i know the way  but how is it you never saw it  because it is behind me  but you can look round  not far enough to see my own back no i always look before me in fact i grow quite blind and deaf when i try to see my back i only mind my work  but how does it be your work  ah that i can't tell you i only know it is because when i do it i feel all right and when i don't i feel all wrong east wind says only one does not exactly know how much to believe of what she says for she is very naughty sometimes she says it is all managed by a baby but whether she is good or naughty when she says that i don't know i just stick to my work it is all one to me to let a bee out of a tulip or to sweep the cobwebs from the sky you would like to go with me to-night  i don't want to see a ship sunk  but suppose i had to take you  why then of course i must go  there's a good diamond i think i had better be growing a bit only you must go to bed first i can't take you till you're in bed that's the law about the children so i had better go and do something else first  very well north wind said diamond what are you going to do first if you please  i think i may tell you jump up on the top of the wall there  i can't  ah and i can't help you you haven't been to bed yet you see come out to the road with me just in front of the coach-house and i will show you  north wind grew very small indeed so small that she could not have blown the dust off a dusty miller as the scotch children call a yellow auricula diamond could not even see the blades of grass move as she flitted along by his foot they left the lawn went out by the wicket in the-coach-house gates and then crossed the road to the low wall that separated it from the river  you can get up on this wall diamond said north wind  yes but my mother has forbidden me  then don't said north wind  but i can see over said diamond  ah to be sure i can't  so saying north wind gave a little bound and stood on the top of the wall she was just about the height a dragon-fly would be if it stood on end  you darling said diamond seeing what a lovely little toy-woman she was  don't be impertinent master diamond said north wind if there's one thing makes me more angry than another it is the way you humans judge things by their size i am quite as respectable now as i shall be six hours after this when i take an east indiaman by the royals twist her round and push her under you have no right to address me in such a fashion  but as she spoke the tiny face wore the smile of a great grand woman she was only having her own beautiful fun out of diamond and true woman's fun never hurts  but look there she resumed do you see a boat with one man in it a green and white boat  yes quite well  that's a poet  i thought you said it was a bo-at  stupid pet don't you know what a poet is  why a thing to sail on the water in  well perhaps you're not so far wrong some poets do carry people over the sea but i have no business to talk so much the man is a poet  the boat is a boat said diamond  can't you spell asked north wind  not very well  so i see a poet is not a bo-at as you call it a poet is a man who is glad of something and tries to make other people glad of it too  ah now i know like the man in the sweety-shop  not very but i see it is no use i wasn't sent to tell you and so i can't tell you i must be off only first just look at the man  he's not much of a rower said diamond paddling first with one fin and then with the other  now look here said north wind  and she flashed like a dragon-fly across the water whose surface rippled and puckered as she passed the next moment the man in the boat glanced about him and bent to his oars the boat flew over the rippling water man and boat and river were awake the same instant almost north wind perched again upon the river wall  how did you do that asked diamond  i blew in his face answered north wind i don't see how that could do it said diamond i daresay not and therefore you will say you don't believe it could  no no dear north wind i know you too well not to believe you  well i blew in his face and that woke him up  but what was the good of it  why don't you see look at him how he is pulling i blew the mist out of him  how was that  that is just what i cannot tell you  but you did it  yes i have to do ten thousand things without being able to tell how  i don't like that said diamond  he was staring after the boat hearing no answer he looked down to the wall  north wind was gone away across the river went a long ripple what sailors call a cat's paw the man in the boat was putting up a sail the moon was coming to herself on the edge of a great cloud and the sail began to shine white diamond rubbed his eyes and wondered what it was all about things seemed going on around him and all to understand each other but he could make nothing of it so he put his hands in his pockets and went in to have his tea the night was very hot for the wind had fallen again  you don't seem very well to-night diamond said his mother  i am quite well mother returned diamond who was only puzzled  i think you had better go to bed she added  very well mother he answered  he stopped for one moment to look out of the window above the moon the clouds were going different ways somehow or other this troubled him but notwithstanding he was soon fast asleep  he woke in the middle of the night and the darkness a terrible noise was rumbling overhead like the rolling beat of great drums echoing through a brazen vault the roof of the loft in which he lay had no ceiling only the tiles were between him and the sky for a while he could not come quite awake for the noise kept beating him down so that his heart was troubled and fluttered painfully a second peal of thunder burst over his head and almost choked him with fear nor did he recover until the great blast that followed having torn some tiles off the roof sent a spout of wind down into his bed and over his face which brought him wide awake and gave him back his courage the same moment he heard a mighty yet musical voice calling him  come up diamond it said it's all ready i'm waiting for you  he looked out of the bed and saw a gigantic powerful but most lovely arm with a hand whose fingers were nothing the less ladylike that they could have strangled a boa-constrictor or choked a tigress off its prey stretched down through a big hole in the roof without a moment's hesitation he reached out his tiny one and laid it in the grand palm before him     chapter vi out in the storm   the hand felt its way up his arm and grasping it gently and strongly above the elbow lifted diamond from the bed the moment he was through the hole in the roof all the winds of heaven seemed to lay hold upon him and buffet him hither and thither his hair blew one way his night-gown another his legs threatened to float from under him and his head to grow dizzy with the swiftness of the invisible assailant cowering he clung with the other hand to the huge hand which held his arm and fear invaded his heart  oh north wind he murmured but the words vanished from his lips as he had seen the soap-bubbles that burst too soon vanish from the mouth of his pipe the wind caught them and they were nowhere they couldn't get out at all but were torn away and strangled and yet north wind heard them and in her answer it seemed to diamond that just because she was so big and could not help it and just because her ear and her mouth must seem to him so dreadfully far away she spoke to him more tenderly and graciously than ever before her voice was like the bass of a deep organ without the groan in it like the most delicate of violin tones without the wail in it like the most glorious of trumpet-ejaculations without the defiance in it like the sound of falling water without the clatter and clash in it  it was like all of them and neither of them all of them without their faults each of them without its peculiarity  after all it was more like his mother's voice than anything else in the world  diamond dear she said be a man what is fearful to you is not the least fearful to me  but it can't hurt you murmured diamond for you're it  then if i'm it and have you in my arms how can it hurt you  oh yes i see whispered diamond but it looks so dreadful and it pushes me about so  yes it does my dear that is what it was sent for  at the same moment a peal of thunder which shook diamond's heart against the sides of his bosom hurtled out of the heavens  i cannot say out of the sky for there was no sky diamond had not seen the lightning for he had been intent on finding the face of north wind every moment the folds of her garment would sweep across his eyes and blind him but between he could just persuade himself that he saw great glories of woman's eyes looking down through rifts in the mountainous clouds over his head  he trembled so at the thunder that his knees failed him and he sunk down at north wind's feet and clasped her round the column of her ankle she instantly stooped lifted him from the roof up up into her bosom and held him there saying as if to an inconsolable child   diamond dear this will never do  oh yes it will answered diamond i am all right now quite comfortable i assure you dear north wind if you will only let me stay here i shall be all right indeed  but you will feel the wind here diamond  i don't mind that a bit so long as i feel your arms through it  answered diamond nestling closer to her grand bosom  brave boy returned north wind pressing him closer  no said diamond i don't see that it's not courage at all so long as i feel you there  but hadn't you better get into my hair then you would not feel the wind you will here  ah but dear north wind you don't know how nice it is to feel your arms about me it is a thousand times better to have them and the wind together than to have only your hair and the back of your neck and no wind at all  but it is surely more comfortable there  well perhaps but i begin to think there are better things than being comfortable  yes indeed there are well i will keep you in front of me you will feel the wind but not too much i shall only want one arm to take care of you the other will be quite enough to sink the ship  oh dear north wind how can you talk so  my dear boy i never talk i always mean what i say  then you do mean to sink the ship with the other hand  yes  it's not like you  how do you know that  quite easily here you are taking care of a poor little boy with one arm and there you are sinking a ship with the other it can't be like you  ah but which is me i can't be two mes you know  no nobody can be two mes  well which me is me  now i must think there looks to be two  yes that's the very point you can't be knowing the thing you don't know can you  no  which me do you know  the kindest goodest best me in the world answered diamond clinging to north wind  why am i good to you  i don't know  have you ever done anything for me  no  then i must be good to you because i choose to be good to you  yes  why should i choose  because because because you like  why should i like to be good to you  i don't know except it be because it's good to be good to me  that's just it i am good to you because i like to be good  then why shouldn't you be good to other people as well as to me  that's just what i don't know why shouldn't i  i don't know either then why shouldn't you  because i am  there it is again said diamond i don't see that you are it looks quite the other thing  well but listen to me diamond you know the one me you say and that is good  yes  do you know the other me as well  no i can't i shouldn't like to  there it is you don't know the other me you are sure of one of them  yes  and you are sure there can't be two mes  yes  then the me you don't know must be the same as the me you do know else there would be two mes  yes  then the other me you don't know must be as kind as the me you do know  yes  besides i tell you that it is so only it doesn't look like it that i confess freely have you anything more to object  no no dear north wind i am quite satisfied  then i will tell you something you might object you might say that the me you know is like the other me and that i am cruel all through  i know that can't be because you are so kind  but that kindness might be only a pretence for the sake of being more cruel afterwards  diamond clung to her tighter than ever crying   no no dear north wind i can't believe that i don't believe it i won't believe it that would kill me i love you and you must love me else how did i come to love you how could you know how to put on such a beautiful face if you did not love me and the rest no you may sink as many ships as you like and i won't say another word i can't say i shall like to see it you know  that's quite another thing said north wind and as she spoke she gave one spring from the roof of the hay-loft and rushed up into the clouds with diamond on her left arm close to her heart and as if the clouds knew she had come they burst into a fresh jubilation of thunderous light for a few moments diamond seemed to be borne up through the depths of an ocean of dazzling flame the next the winds were writhing around him like a storm of serpents for they were in the midst of the clouds and mists and they of course took the shapes of the wind eddying and wreathing and whirling and shooting and dashing about like grey and black water so that it was as if the wind itself had taken shape and he saw the grey and black wind tossing and raving most madly all about him now it blinded him by smiting him upon the eyes now it deafened him by bellowing in his ears for even when the thunder came he knew now that it was the billows of the great ocean of the air dashing against each other in their haste to fill the hollow scooped out by the lightning now it took his breath quite away by sucking it from his body with the speed of its rush but he did not mind it he only gasped first and then laughed for the arm of north wind was about him and he was leaning against her bosom it is quite impossible for me to describe what he saw did you ever watch a great wave shoot into a winding passage amongst rocks if you ever did you would see that the water rushed every way at once some of it even turning back and opposing the rest greater confusion you might see nowhere except in a crowd of frightened people well the wind was like that except that it went much faster and therefore was much wilder and twisted and shot and curled and dodged and clashed and raved ten times more madly than anything else in creation except human passions diamond saw the threads of the lady's hair streaking it all in parts indeed he could not tell which was hair and which was black storm and vapour it seemed sometimes that all the great billows of mist-muddy wind were woven out of the crossing lines of north wind's infinite hair sweeping in endless intertwistings and diamond felt as the wind seized on his hair which his mother kept rather long as if he too was a part of the storm and some of its life went out from him but so sheltered was he by north wind's arm and bosom that only at times in the fiercer onslaught of some curl-billowed eddy did he recognise for a moment how wild was the storm in which he was carried nestling in its very core and formative centre  it seemed to diamond likewise that they were motionless in this centre and that all the confusion and fighting went on around them flash after flash illuminated the fierce chaos revealing in varied yellow and blue and grey and dusky red the vapourous contention peal after peal of thunder tore the infinite waste but it seemed to diamond that north wind and he were motionless all but the hair it was not so they were sweeping with the speed of the wind itself towards the sea     chapter vii the cathedral   i must not go on describing what cannot be described for nothing is more wearisome  before they reached the sea diamond felt north wind's hair just beginning to fall about him  is the storm over north wind he called out  no diamond i am only waiting a moment to set you down you would not like to see the ship sunk and i am going to give you a place to stop in till i come back for you  oh thank you said diamond i shall be sorry to leave you north wind but i would rather not see the ship go down and i'm afraid the poor people will cry and i should hear them oh dear  there are a good many passengers on board and to tell the truth diamond i don't care about your hearing the cry you speak of i am afraid you would not get it out of your little head again for a long time  but how can you bear it then north wind for i am sure you are kind i shall never doubt that again  i will tell you how i am able to bear it diamond  i am always hearing through every noise through all the noise i am making myself even the sound of a far-off song i do not exactly know where it is or what it means and i don't hear much of it only the odour of its music as it were flitting across the great billows of the ocean outside this air in which i make such a storm but what i do hear is quite enough to make me able to bear the cry from the drowning ship so it would you if you could hear it  no it wouldn't returned diamond stoutly for they wouldn't hear the music of the far-away song and if they did it wouldn't do them any good you see you and i are not going to be drowned and so we might enjoy it  but you have never heard the psalm and you don't know what it is like somehow i can't say how it tells me that all is right that it is coming to swallow up all cries  but that won't do them any good the people i mean persisted diamond  it must it must said north wind hurriedly it wouldn't be the song it seems to be if it did not swallow up all their fear and pain too and set them singing it themselves with the rest i am sure it will and do you know ever since i knew i had hair that is ever since it began to go out and away that song has been coming nearer and nearer only i must say it was some thousand years before i heard it  but how can you say it was coming nearer when you did not hear it  asked doubting little diamond  since i began to hear it i know it is growing louder therefore i judge it was coming nearer and nearer until i did hear it first i'm not so very old you know a few thousand years only and i was quite a baby when i heard the noise first but i knew it must come from the voices of people ever so much older and wiser than i was i can't sing at all except now and then and i can never tell what my song is going to be i only know what it is after i have sung it but this will never do will you stop here  i can't see anywhere to stop said diamond your hair is all down like a darkness and i can't see through it if i knock my eyes into it ever so much  look then said north wind and with one sweep of her great white arm she swept yards deep of darkness like a great curtain from before the face of the boy  and lo it was a blue night lit up with stars where it did not shine with stars it shimmered with the milk of the stars except where just opposite to diamond's face the grey towers of a cathedral blotted out each its own shape of sky and stars  oh what's that cried diamond struck with a kind of terror for he had never seen a cathedral and it rose before him with an awful reality in the midst of the wide spaces conquering emptiness with grandeur  a very good place for you to wait in said north wind but we shall go in and you shall judge for yourself  there was an open door in the middle of one of the towers leading out upon the roof and through it they passed then north wind set diamond on his feet and he found himself at the top of a stone stair which went twisting away down into the darkness for only a little light came in at the door it was enough however to allow diamond to see that north wind stood beside him he looked up to find her face and saw that she was no longer a beautiful giantess but the tall gracious lady he liked best to see she took his hand and giving him the broad part of the spiral stair to walk on led him down a good way then opening another little door led him out upon a narrow gallery that ran all round the central part of the church on the ledges of the windows of the clerestory and through openings in the parts of the wall that divided the windows from each other it was very narrow and except when they were passing through the wall diamond saw nothing to keep him from falling into the church it lay below him like a great silent gulf hollowed in stone and he held his breath for fear as he looked down  what are you trembling for little diamond said the lady as she walked gently along with her hand held out behind her leading him for there was not breadth enough for them to walk side by side  i am afraid of falling down there answered diamond it is so deep down  yes rather answered north wind but you were a hundred times higher a few minutes ago  ah yes but somebody's arm was about me then said diamond putting his little mouth to the beautiful cold hand that had a hold of his  what a dear little warm mouth you've got said north wind it is a pity you should talk nonsense with it don't you know i have a hold of you  yes but i'm walking on my own legs and they might slip i can't trust myself so well as your arms  but i have a hold of you i tell you foolish child  yes but somehow i can't feel comfortable  if you were to fall and my hold of you were to give way i should be down after you in a less moment than a lady's watch can tick and catch you long before you had reached the ground  i don't like it though said diamond  oh oh oh he screamed the next moment bent double with terror for north wind had let go her hold of his hand and had vanished leaving him standing as if rooted to the gallery  she left the words come after me sounding in his ears  but move he dared not in a moment more he would from very terror have fallen into the church but suddenly there came a gentle breath of cool wind upon his face and it kept blowing upon him in little puffs and at every puff diamond felt his faintness going away and his fear with it courage was reviving in his little heart and still the cool wafts of the soft wind breathed upon him and the soft wind was so mighty and strong within its gentleness that in a minute more diamond was marching along the narrow ledge as fearless for the time as north wind herself  he walked on and on with the windows all in a row on one side of him and the great empty nave of the church echoing to every one of his brave strides on the other until at last he came to a little open door from which a broader stair led him down and down and down till at last all at once he found himself in the arms of north wind who held him close to her and kissed him on the forehead diamond nestled to her and murmured into her bosom why did you leave me dear north wind  because i wanted you to walk alone she answered  but it is so much nicer here said diamond  i daresay but i couldn't hold a little coward to my heart it would make me so cold  but i wasn't brave of myself said diamond whom my older readers will have already discovered to be a true child in this that he was given to metaphysics it was the wind that blew in my face that made me brave wasn't it now north wind  yes  i know that you had to be taught what courage was and you couldn't know what it was without feeling it  therefore it was given you but don't you feel as if you would try to be brave yourself next time  yes i do but trying is not much  yes it is a very great deal for it is a beginning and a beginning is the greatest thing of all to try to be brave is to be brave the coward who tries to be brave is before the man who is brave because he is made so and never had to try  how kind you are north wind  i am only just all kindness is but justice we owe it  i don't quite understand that  never mind you will some day there is no hurry about understanding it now  who blew the wind on me that made me brave  i did  i didn't see you  therefore you can believe me  yes yes of course but how was it that such a little breath could be so strong  that i don't know  but you made it strong  no  i only blew it i knew it would make you strong just as it did the man in the boat you remember but how my breath has that power i cannot tell it was put into it when i was made that is all i know but really i must be going about my work  ah the poor ship i wish you would stop here and let the poor ship go  that i dare not do will you stop here till i come back  yes you won't be long  not longer than i can help trust me you shall get home before the morning  in a moment north wind was gone and the next diamond heard a moaning about the church which grew and grew to a roaring the storm was up again and he knew that north wind's hair was flying  the church was dark only a little light came through the windows which were almost all of that precious old stained glass which is so much lovelier than the new but diamond could not see how beautiful they were for there was not enough of light in the stars to show the colours of them he could only just distinguish them from the walls he looked up but could not see the gallery along which he had passed he could only tell where it was far up by the faint glimmer of the windows of the clerestory whose sills made part of it the church grew very lonely about him and he began to feel like a child whose mother has forsaken it only he knew that to be left alone is not always to be forsaken  he began to feel his way about the place and for a while went wandering up and down his little footsteps waked little answering echoes in the great house it wasn't too big to mind him it was as if the church knew he was there and meant to make itself his house so it went on giving back an answer to every step until at length diamond thought he should like to say something out loud and see what the church would answer but he found he was afraid to speak he could not utter a word for fear of the loneliness perhaps it was as well that he did not for the sound of a spoken word would have made him feel the place yet more deserted and empty but he thought he could sing he was fond of singing and at home he used to sing to tunes of his own all the nursery rhymes he knew so he began to try `hey diddle diddle' but it wouldn't do then he tried `little boy blue' but it was no better neither would `sing a song of sixpence' sing itself at all then he tried `poor old cockytoo' but he wouldn't do they all sounded so silly and he had never thought them silly before so he was quiet and listened to the echoes that came out of the dark corners in answer to his footsteps  at last he gave a great sigh and said i'm so tired but he did not hear the gentle echo that answered from far away over his head for at the same moment he came against the lowest of a few steps that stretched across the church and fell down and hurt his arm he cried a little first and then crawled up the steps on his hands and knees at the top he came to a little bit of carpet on which he lay down and there he lay staring at the dull window that rose nearly a hundred feet above his head  now this was the eastern window of the church and the moon was at that moment just on the edge of the horizon the next she was peeping over it and lo with the moon st john and st paul and the rest of them began to dawn in the window in their lovely garments diamond did not know that the wonder-working moon was behind and he thought all the light was coming out of the window itself and that the good old men were appearing to help him growing out of the night and the darkness because he had hurt his arm and was very tired and lonely and north wind was so long in coming so he lay and looked at them backwards over his head wondering when they would come down or what they would do next they were very dim for the moonlight was not strong enough for the colours and he had enough to do with his eyes trying to make out their shapes so his eyes grew tired and more and more tired and his eyelids grew so heavy that they would keep tumbling down over his eyes he kept lifting them and lifting them but every time they were heavier than the last it was no use  they were too much for him sometimes before he had got them half up down they were again and at length he gave it up quite and the moment he gave it up he was fast asleep     chapter viii the east window   that diamond had fallen fast asleep is very evident from the strange things he now fancied as taking place for he thought he heard a sound as of whispering up in the great window he tried to open his eyes but he could not and the whispering went on and grew louder and louder until he could hear every word that was said he thought it was the apostles talking about him but he could not open his eyes  and how comes he to be lying there st peter said one  i think i saw him a while ago up in the gallery under the nicodemus window perhaps he has fallen down  what do you think st matthew  i don't think he could have crept here after falling from such a height he must have been killed  what are we to do with him we can't leave him lying there and we could not make him comfortable up here in the window  it's rather crowded already what do you say st thomas  let's go down and look at him  there came a rustling and a chinking for some time and then there was a silence and diamond felt somehow that all the apostles were standing round him and looking down on him and still he could not open his eyes  what is the matter with him st luke asked one  there's nothing the matter with him answered st luke who must have joined the company of the apostles from the next window one would think he's in a sound sleep  i have it cried another this is one of north wind's tricks she has caught him up and dropped him at our door like a withered leaf or a foundling baby i don't understand that woman's conduct i must say as if we hadn't enough to do with our money without going taking care of other people's children that's not what our forefathers built cathedrals for  now diamond could not bear to hear such things against north wind who he knew never played anybody a trick she was far too busy with her own work for that he struggled hard to open his eyes but without success  she should consider that a church is not a place for pranks not to mention that we live in it said another  it certainly is disrespectful of her but she always is disrespectful what right has she to bang at our windows as she has been doing the whole of this night i daresay there is glass broken somewhere i know my blue robe is in a dreadful mess with the rain first and the dust after it will cost me shillings to clean it  then diamond knew that they could not be apostles talking like this they could only be the sextons and vergers and such-like who got up at night and put on the robes of deans and bishops and called each other grand names as the foolish servants he had heard his father tell of call themselves lords and ladies after their masters and mistresses and he was so angry at their daring to abuse north wind that he jumped up crying north wind knows best what she is about she has a good right to blow the cobwebs from your windows for she was sent to do it she sweeps them away from grander places i can tell you for i've been with her at it  this was what he began to say but as he spoke his eyes came wide open and behold there were neither apostles nor vergers there not even a window with the effigies of holy men in it but a dark heap of hay all about him and the little panes in the roof of his loft glimmering blue in the light of the morning old diamond was coming awake down below in the stable in a moment more he was on his feet and shaking himself so that young diamond's bed trembled under him  he's grand at shaking himself said diamond i wish i could shake myself like that but then i can wash myself and he can't what fun it would be to see old diamond washing his face with his hoofs and iron shoes wouldn't it be a picture  so saying he got up and dressed himself then he went out into the garden there must have been a tremendous wind in the night for although all was quiet now there lay the little summer-house crushed to the ground and over it the great elm-tree which the wind had broken across being much decayed in the middle diamond almost cried to see the wilderness of green leaves which used to be so far up in the blue air tossing about in the breeze and liking it best when the wind blew it most now lying so near the ground and without any hope of ever getting up into the deep air again  i wonder how old the tree is thought diamond it must take a long time to get so near the sky as that poor tree was  yes indeed said a voice beside him for diamond had spoken the last words aloud  diamond started and looking around saw a clergyman a brother of mrs coleman who happened to be visiting her he was a great scholar and was in the habit of rising early  who are you my man he added  little diamond answered the boy  oh i have heard of you how do you come to be up so early  because the sham apostles talked such nonsense they waked me up  the clergyman stared diamond saw that he had better have held his tongue for he could not explain things  you must have been dreaming my little man said he dear dear he went on looking at the tree there has been terrible work here this is the north wind's doing what a pity i wish we lived at the back of it i'm sure  where is that sir asked diamond  away in the hyperborean regions answered the clergyman smiling  i never heard of the place returned diamond  i daresay not answered the clergyman but if this tree had been there now it would not have been blown down for there is no wind there  but please sir if it had been there said diamond we should not have had to be sorry for it  certainly not  then we shouldn't have had to be glad for it either  you're quite right my boy said the clergyman looking at him very kindly as he turned away to the house with his eyes bent towards the earth but diamond thought within himself i will ask north wind next time i see her to take me to that country i think she did speak about it once before     chapter ix how diamond got to the back of the north wind   when diamond went home to breakfast he found his father and mother already seated at the table they were both busy with their bread and butter and diamond sat himself down in his usual place his mother looked up at him and after watching him for a moment said   i don't think the boy is looking well husband  don't you well i don't know i think he looks pretty bobbish how do you feel yourself diamond my boy  quite well thank you father at least i think i've got a little headache  there i told you said his father and mother both at once  the child's very poorly added his mother  the child's quite well added his father  and then they both laughed  you see said his mother i've had a letter from my sister at sandwich  sleepy old hole said his father  don't abuse the place there's good people in it said his mother  right old lady returned his father only i don't believe there are more than two pair of carriage-horses in the whole blessed place  well people can get to heaven without carriages or coachmen either husband not that i should like to go without my coachman you know but about the boy  what boy  that boy there staring at you with his goggle-eyes  have i got goggle-eyes mother asked diamond a little dismayed  not too goggle said his mother who was quite proud of her boy's eyes only did not want to make him vain  not too goggle only you need not stare so  well what about him said his father  i told you i had got a letter  yes from your sister not from diamond  la husband you've got out of bed the wrong leg first this morning i do believe  i always get out with both at once said his father laughing  well listen then his aunt wants the boy to go down and see her  and that's why you want to make out that he ain't looking well  no more he is i think he had better go  well i don't care if you can find the money said his father  i'll manage that said his mother and so it was agreed that diamond should go to sandwich  i will not describe the preparations diamond made you would have thought he had been going on a three months' voyage nor will i describe the journey for our business is now at the place he was met at the station by his aunt a cheerful middle-aged woman and conveyed in safety to the sleepy old town as his father called it and no wonder that it was sleepy for it was nearly dead of old age  diamond went about staring with his beautiful goggle-eyes at the quaint old streets and the shops and the houses everything looked very strange indeed for here was a town abandoned by its nurse the sea like an old oyster left on the shore till it gaped for weariness it used to be one of the five chief seaports in england but it began to hold itself too high and the consequence was the sea grew less and less intimate with it gradually drew back and kept more to itself till at length it left it high and dry  sandwich was a seaport no more the sea went on with its own tide-business a long way off and forgot it of course it went to sleep and had no more to do with ships that's what comes to cities and nations and boys and girls who say i can do without your help i'm enough for myself  diamond soon made great friends with an old woman who kept a toyshop for his mother had given him twopence for pocket-money before he left and he had gone into her shop to spend it and she got talking to him she looked very funny because she had not got any teeth but diamond liked her and went often to her shop although he had nothing to spend there after the twopence was gone  one afternoon he had been wandering rather wearily about the streets for some time it was a hot day and he felt tired as he passed the toyshop he stepped in  please may i sit down for a minute on this box he said thinking the old woman was somewhere in the shop but he got no answer and sat down without one around him were a great many toys of all prices from a penny up to shillings all at once he heard a gentle whirring somewhere amongst them it made him start and look behind him there were the sails of a windmill going round and round almost close to his ear he thought at first it must be one of those toys which are wound up and go with clockwork but no it was a common penny toy with the windmill at the end of a whistle and when the whistle blows the windmill goes but the wonder was that there was no one at the whistle end blowing and yet the sails were turning round and round now faster now slower now faster again  what can it mean said diamond aloud  it means me said the tiniest voice he had ever heard  who are you please asked diamond  well really i begin to be ashamed of you said the voice i wonder how long it will be before you know me or how often i might take you in before you got sharp enough to suspect me you are as bad as a baby that doesn't know his mother in a new bonnet  not quite so bad as that dear north wind said diamond for i didn't see you at all and indeed i don't see you yet although i recognise your voice do grow a little please  not a hair's-breadth said the voice and it was the smallest voice that ever spoke what are you doing here  i am come to see my aunt but please north wind why didn't you come back for me in the church that night  i did i carried you safe home all the time you were dreaming about the glass apostles you were lying in my arms  i'm so glad said diamond i thought that must be it only i wanted to hear you say so did you sink the ship then  yes  and drown everybody  not quite one boat got away with six or seven men in it  how could the boat swim when the ship couldn't  of course i had some trouble with it i had to contrive a bit and manage the waves a little when they're once thoroughly waked up i have a good deal of trouble with them sometimes they're apt to get stupid with tumbling over each other's heads that's when they're fairly at it however the boat got to a desert island before noon next day  and what good will come of that  i don't know i obeyed orders good bye  oh stay north wind do stay cried diamond dismayed to see the windmill get slower and slower  what is it my dear child said north wind and the windmill began turning again so swiftly that diamond could scarcely see it what a big voice you've got and what a noise you do make with it what is it you want i have little to do but that little must be done  i want you to take me to the country at the back of the north wind  that's not so easy said north wind and was silent for so long that diamond thought she was gone indeed but after he had quite given her up the voice began again  i almost wish old herodotus had held his tongue about it much he knew of it  why do you wish that north wind  because then that clergyman would never have heard of it and set you wanting to go but we shall see we shall see you must go home now my dear for you don't seem very well and i'll see what can be done for you don't wait for me i've got to break a few of old goody's toys she's thinking too much of her new stock two or three will do there go now  diamond rose quite sorry and without a word left the shop and went home  it soon appeared that his mother had been right about him for that same afternoon his head began to ache very much and he had to go to bed  he awoke in the middle of the night the lattice window of his room had blown open and the curtains of his little bed were swinging about in the wind  if that should be north wind now thought diamond  but the next moment he heard some one closing the window and his aunt came to his bedside she put her hand on his face and said   how's your head dear  better auntie i think  would you like something to drink  oh yes i should please  so his aunt gave him some lemonade for she had been used to nursing sick people and diamond felt very much refreshed and laid his head down again to go very fast asleep as he thought and so he did but only to come awake again as a fresh burst of wind blew the lattice open a second time the same moment he found himself in a cloud of north wind's hair with her beautiful face set in it like a moon bending over him  quick diamond she said i have found such a chance  but i'm not well said diamond  i know that but you will be better for a little fresh air you shall have plenty of that  you want me to go then  yes i do it won't hurt you  very well said diamond and getting out of the bed-clothes he jumped into north wind's arms  we must make haste before your aunt comes said she as she glided out of the open lattice and left it swinging  the moment diamond felt her arms fold around him he began to feel better it was a moonless night and very dark with glimpses of stars when the clouds parted  i used to dash the waves about here said north wind where cows and sheep are feeding now but we shall soon get to them there they are  and diamond looking down saw the white glimmer of breaking water far below him  you see diamond said north wind it is very difficult for me to get you to the back of the north wind for that country lies in the very north itself and of course i can't blow northwards  why not asked diamond  you little silly said north wind don't you see that if i were to blow northwards i should be south wind and that is as much as to say that one person could be two persons  but how can you ever get home at all then  you are quite right that is my home though i never get farther than the outer door i sit on the doorstep and hear the voices inside i am nobody there diamond  i'm very sorry  why  that you should be nobody  oh i don't mind it dear little man you will be very glad some day to be nobody yourself but you can't understand that now and you had better not try for if you do you will be certain to go fancying some egregious nonsense and making yourself miserable about it  then i won't said diamond  there's a good boy it will all come in good time  but you haven't told me how you get to the doorstep you know  it is easy enough for me i have only to consent to be nobody and there i am i draw into myself and there i am on the doorstep but you can easily see or you have less sense than i think that to drag you you heavy thing along with me would take centuries and i could not give the time to it  oh i'm so sorry said diamond  what for now pet  that i'm so heavy for you i would be lighter if i could but i don't know how  you silly darling why i could toss you a hundred miles from me if i liked it is only when i am going home that i shall find you heavy  then you are going home with me  of course did i not come to fetch you just for that  but all this time you must be going southwards  yes of course i am  how can you be taking me northwards then  a very sensible question but you shall see i will get rid of a few of these clouds only they do come up so fast it's like trying to blow a brook dry there what do you see now  i think i see a little boat away there down below  a little boat indeed well she's a yacht of two hundred tons and the captain of it is a friend of mine for he is a man of good sense and can sail his craft well i've helped him many a time when he little thought it i've heard him grumbling at me when i was doing the very best i could for him why i've carried him eighty miles a day again and again right north  he must have dodged for that said diamond who had been watching the vessels and had seen that they went other ways than the wind blew  of course he must but don't you see it was the best i could do i couldn't be south wind and besides it gave him a share in the business it is not good at all mind that diamond to do everything for those you love and not give them a share in the doing it's not kind it's making too much of yourself my child if i had been south wind he would only have smoked his pipe all day and made himself stupid  but how could he be a man of sense and grumble at you when you were doing your best for him  oh you must make allowances said north wind or you will never do justice to anybody you do understand then that a captain may sail north    in spite of a north wind yes supplemented diamond  now i do think you must be stupid my dear said north wind suppose the north wind did not blow where would he be then  why then the south wind would carry him  so you think that when the north wind stops the south wind blows nonsense if i didn't blow the captain couldn't sail his eighty miles a day no doubt south wind would carry him faster but south wind is sitting on her doorstep then and if i stopped there would be a dead calm so you are all wrong to say he can sail north in spite of me he sails north by my help and my help alone you see that diamond  yes i do north wind i am stupid but i don't want to be stupid  good boy i am going to blow you north in that little craft one of the finest that ever sailed the sea here we are right over it i shall be blowing against you you will be sailing against me and all will be just as we want it the captain won't get on so fast as he would like but he will get on and so shall we i'm just going to put you on board do you see in front of the tiller that thing the man is working now to one side now to the other a round thing like the top of a drum  yes said diamond  below that is where they keep their spare sails and some stores of that sort i am going to blow that cover off the same moment i will drop you on deck and you must tumble in don't be afraid it is of no depth and you will fall on sail-cloth you will find it nice and warm and dry-only dark and you will know i am near you by every roll and pitch of the vessel coil yourself up and go to sleep the yacht shall be my cradle and you shall be my baby  thank you dear north wind i am not a bit afraid said diamond  in a moment they were on a level with the bulwarks and north wind sent the hatch of the after-store rattling away over the deck to leeward the next diamond found himself in the dark for he had tumbled through the hole as north wind had told him and the cover was replaced over his head away he went rolling to leeward for the wind began all at once to blow hard he heard the call of the captain and the loud trampling of the men over his head as they hauled at the main sheet to get the boom on board that they might take in a reef in the mainsail diamond felt about until he had found what seemed the most comfortable place and there he snuggled down and lay  hours after hours a great many of them went by and still diamond lay there he never felt in the least tired or impatient for a strange pleasure filled his heart the straining of the masts the creaking of the boom the singing of the ropes the banging of the blocks as they put the vessel about all fell in with the roaring of the wind above the surge of the waves past her sides and the thud with which every now and then one would strike her while through it all diamond could hear the gurgling rippling talking flow of the water against her planks as she slipped through it lying now on this side now on that like a subdued air running through the grand music his north wind was making about him to keep him from tiring as they sped on towards the country at the back of her doorstep  how long this lasted diamond had no idea he seemed to fall asleep sometimes only through the sleep he heard the sounds going on at length the weather seemed to get worse the confusion and trampling of feet grew more frequent over his head the vessel lay over more and more on her side and went roaring through the waves which banged and thumped at her as if in anger all at once arose a terrible uproar the hatch was blown off a cold fierce wind swept in upon him and a long arm came with it which laid hold of him and lifted him out the same moment he saw the little vessel far below him righting herself she had taken in all her sails and lay now tossing on the waves like a sea-bird with folded wings a short distance to the south lay a much larger vessel with two or three sails set and towards it north wind was carrying diamond it was a german ship on its way to the north pole  that vessel down there will give us a lift now said north wind and after that i must do the best i can  she managed to hide him amongst the flags of the big ship which were all snugly stowed away and on and on they sped towards the north at length one night she whispered in his ear come on deck diamond and he got up at once and crept on deck everything looked very strange here and there on all sides were huge masses of floating ice looking like cathedrals and castles and crags while away beyond was a blue sea  is the sun rising or setting asked diamond  neither or both which you please i can hardly tell which myself if he is setting now he will be rising the next moment  what a strange light it is said diamond i have heard that the sun doesn't go to bed all the summer in these parts miss coleman told me that i suppose he feels very sleepy and that is why the light he sends out looks so like a dream  that will account for it well enough for all practical purposes said north wind  some of the icebergs were drifting northwards one was passing very near the ship north wind seized diamond and with a single bound lighted on one of them a huge thing with sharp pinnacles and great clefts the same instant a wind began to blow from the south north wind hurried diamond down the north side of the iceberg stepping by its jags and splintering for this berg had never got far enough south to be melted and smoothed by the summer sun she brought him to a cave near the water where she entered and letting diamond go sat down as if weary on a ledge of ice  diamond seated himself on the other side and for a while was enraptured with the colour of the air inside the cave it was a deep dazzling lovely blue deeper than the deepest blue of the sky the blue seemed to be in constant motion like the blackness when you press your eyeballs with your fingers boiling and sparkling but when he looked across to north wind he was frightened her face was worn and livid  what is the matter with you dear north wind he said  nothing much i feel very faint but you mustn't mind it for i can bear it quite well south wind always blows me faint if it were not for the cool of the thick ice between me and her i should faint altogether indeed as it is i fear i must vanish  diamond stared at her in terror for he saw that her form and face were growing not small but transparent like something dissolving not in water but in light he could see the side of the blue cave through her very heart and she melted away till all that was left was a pale face like the moon in the morning with two great lucid eyes in it  i am going diamond she said  does it hurt you asked diamond  it's very uncomfortable she answered but i don't mind it for i shall come all right again before long i thought i should be able to go with you all the way but i cannot you must not be frightened though just go straight on and you will come all right you'll find me on the doorstep  as she spoke her face too faded quite away only diamond thought he could still see her eyes shining through the blue when he went closer however he found that what he thought her eyes were only two hollows in the ice north wind was quite gone and diamond would have cried if he had not trusted her so thoroughly so he sat still in the blue air of the cavern listening to the wash and ripple of the water all about the base of the iceberg as it sped on and on into the open sea northwards it was an excellent craft to go with the current for there was twice as much of it below water as above but a light south wind was blowing too and so it went fast  after a little while diamond went out and sat on the edge of his floating island and looked down into the ocean beneath him the white sides of the berg reflected so much light below the water that he could see far down into the green abyss sometimes he fancied he saw the eyes of north wind looking up at him from below but the fancy never lasted beyond the moment of its birth and the time passed he did not know how for he felt as if he were in a dream when he got tired of the green water he went into the blue cave and when he got tired of the blue cave he went out and gazed all about him on the blue sea ever sparkling in the sun which kept wheeling about the sky never going below the horizon but he chiefly gazed northwards to see whether any land were appearing all this time he never wanted to eat he broke off little bits of the berg now and then and sucked them and he thought them very nice  at length one time he came out of his cave he spied far off on the horizon a shining peak that rose into the sky like the top of some tremendous iceberg and his vessel was bearing him straight towards it as it went on the peak rose and rose higher and higher above the horizon and other peaks rose after it with sharp edges and jagged ridges connecting them diamond thought this must be the place he was going to and he was right for the mountains rose and rose till he saw the line of the coast at their feet and at length the iceberg drove into a little bay all around which were lofty precipices with snow on their tops and streaks of ice down their sides the berg floated slowly up to a projecting rock diamond stepped on shore and without looking behind him began to follow a natural path which led windingly towards the top of the precipice  when he reached it he found himself on a broad table of ice along which he could walk without much difficulty before him at a considerable distance rose a lofty ridge of ice which shot up into fantastic pinnacles and towers and battlements the air was very cold and seemed somehow dead for there was not the slightest breath of wind  in the centre of the ridge before him appeared a gap like the opening of a valley but as he walked towards it gazing and wondering whether that could be the way he had to take he saw that what had appeared a gap was the form of a woman seated against the ice front of the ridge leaning forwards with her hands in her lap and her hair hanging down to the ground  it is north wind on her doorstep said diamond joyfully and hurried on  he soon came up to the place and there the form sat like one of the great figures at the door of an egyptian temple motionless with drooping arms and head then diamond grew frightened because she did not move nor speak he was sure it was north wind but he thought she must be dead at last her face was white as the snow her eyes were blue as the air in the ice-cave and her hair hung down straight like icicles she had on a greenish robe like the colour in the hollows of a glacier seen from far off  he stood up before her and gazed fearfully into her face for a few minutes before he ventured to speak at length with a great effort and a trembling voice he faltered out   north wind  well child said the form without lifting its head  are you ill dear north wind  no i am waiting  what for  till i'm wanted  you don't care for me any more said diamond almost crying now  yes i do only i can't show it all my love is down at the bottom of my heart but i feel it bubbling there  what do you want me to do next dear north wind said diamond wishing to show his love by being obedient  what do you want to do yourself  i want to go into the country at your back  then you must go through me  i don't know what you mean  i mean just what i say you must walk on as if i were an open door and go right through me  but that will hurt you  not in the least it will hurt you though  i don't mind that if you tell me to do it  do it said north wind  diamond walked towards her instantly when he reached her knees he put out his hand to lay it on her but nothing was there save an intense cold he walked on then all grew white about him and the cold stung him like fire he walked on still groping through the whiteness it thickened about him at last it got into his heart and he lost all sense i would say that he fainted only whereas in common faints all grows black about you he felt swallowed up in whiteness it was when he reached north wind's heart that he fainted and fell but as he fell he rolled over the threshold and it was thus that diamond got to the back of the north wind     chapter x at the back of the north wind   i have now come to the most difficult part of my story and why because i do not know enough about it and why should i not know as much about this part as about any other part for of course i could know nothing about the story except diamond had told it and why should not diamond tell about the country at the back of the north wind as well as about his adventures in getting there because when he came back he had forgotten a great deal and what he did remember was very hard to tell things there are so different from things here the people there do not speak the same language for one thing indeed diamond insisted that there they do not speak at all i do not think he was right but it may well have appeared so to diamond the fact is we have different reports of the place from the most trustworthy people therefore we are bound to believe that it appears somewhat different to different people all however agree in a general way about it  i will tell you something of what two very different people have reported both of whom knew more about it i believe than herodotus one of them speaks from his own experience for he visited the country the other from the testimony of a young peasant girl who came back from it for a month's visit to her friends the former was a great italian of noble family who died more than five hundred years ago the latter a scotch shepherd who died not forty years ago  the italian then informs us that he had to enter that country through a fire so hot that he would have thrown himself into boiling glass to cool himself this was not diamond's experience but then durante that was the name of the italian and it means lasting for his books will last as long as there are enough men in the world worthy of having them durante was an elderly man and diamond was a little boy and so their experience must be a little different the peasant girl on the other hand fell fast asleep in a wood and woke in the same country  in describing it durante says that the ground everywhere smelt sweetly and that a gentle even-tempered wind which never blew faster or slower breathed in his face as he went making all the leaves point one way not so as to disturb the birds in the tops of the trees but on the contrary sounding a bass to their song he describes also a little river which was so full that its little waves as it hurried along bent the grass full of red and yellow flowers through which it flowed he says that the purest stream in the world beside this one would look as if it were mixed with something that did not belong to it even although it was flowing ever in the brown shadow of the trees and neither sun nor moon could shine upon it he seems to imply that it is always the month of may in that country it would be out of place to describe here the wonderful sights he saw for the music of them is in another key from that of this story and i shall therefore only add from the account of this traveller that the people there are so free and so just and so healthy that every one of them has a crown like a king and a mitre like a priest  the peasant girl kilmeny was her name could not report such grand things as durante for as the shepherd says telling her story as i tell diamond's              kilmeny had been she knew not where            and kilmeny had seen what she could not declare            kilmeny had been where the cock never crew            where the rain never fell and the wind never blew            but it seemed as the harp of the sky had rung            and the airs of heaven played round her tongue            when she spoke of the lovely forms she had seen            and a land where sin had never been            a land of love and a land of light            withouten sun or moon or night            where the river swayed a living stream            and the light a pure and cloudless beam             the land of vision it would seem            and still an everlasting dream   the last two lines are the shepherd's own remark and a matter of opinion but it is clear i think that kilmeny must have described the same country as durante saw though not having his experience she could neither understand nor describe it so well  now i must give you such fragments of recollection as diamond was able to bring back with him  when he came to himself after he fell he found himself at the back of the north wind north wind herself was nowhere to be seen neither was there a vestige of snow or of ice within sight the sun too had vanished but that was no matter for there was plenty of a certain still rayless light where it came from he never found out but he thought it belonged to the country itself sometimes he thought it came out of the flowers which were very bright but had no strong colour he said the river for all agree that there is a river there flowed not only through but over grass  its channel instead of being rock stones pebbles sand or anything else was of pure meadow grass not over long he insisted that if it did not sing tunes in people's ears it sung tunes in their heads in proof of which i may mention that in the troubles which followed diamond was often heard singing and when asked what he was singing would answer one of the tunes the river at the back of the north wind sung and i may as well say at once that diamond never told these things to any one but no i had better not say who it was but whoever it was told me and i thought it would be well to write them for my child-readers  he could not say he was very happy there for he had neither his father nor mother with him but he felt so still and quiet and patient and contented that as far as the mere feeling went it was something better than mere happiness nothing went wrong at the back of the north wind neither was anything quite right he thought only everything was going to be right some day his account disagreed with that of durante and agreed with that of kilmeny in this that he protested there was no wind there at all i fancy he missed it at all events we could not do without wind it all depends on how big our lungs are whether the wind is too strong for us or not  when the person he told about it asked him whether he saw anybody he knew there he answered only a little girl belonging to the gardener who thought he had lost her but was quite mistaken for there she was safe enough and was to come back some day as i came back if they would only wait  did you talk to her diamond  no nobody talks there they only look at each other and understand everything  is it cold there  no  is it hot  no  what is it then  you never think about such things there  what a queer place it must be  it's a very good place  do you want to go back again  no i don't think i have left it i feel it here somewhere  did the people there look pleased  yes quite pleased only a little sad  then they didn't look glad  they looked as if they were waiting to be gladder some day  this was how diamond used to answer questions about that country and now i will take up the story again and tell you how he got back to this country     chapter xi how diamond got home again   when one at the back of the north wind wanted to know how things were going with any one he loved he had to go to a certain tree climb the stem and sit down in the branches in a few minutes if he kept very still he would see something at least of what was going on with the people he loved  one day when diamond was sitting in this tree he began to long very much to get home again and no wonder for he saw his mother crying durante says that the people there may always follow their wishes because they never wish but what is good diamond's wish was to get home and he would fain follow his wish  but how was he to set about it if he could only see north wind but the moment he had got to her back she was gone altogether from his sight he had never seen her back she might be sitting on her doorstep still looking southwards and waiting white and thin and blue-eyed until she was wanted or she might have again become a mighty creature with power to do that which was demanded of her and gone far away upon many missions she must be somewhere however he could not go home without her and therefore he must find her she could never have intended to leave him always away from his mother if there had been any danger of that she would have told him and given him his choice about going for north wind was right honest how to find north wind therefore occupied all his thoughts  in his anxiety about his mother he used to climb the tree every day and sit in its branches however many of the dwellers there did so they never incommoded one another for the moment one got into the tree he became invisible to every one else and it was such a wide-spreading tree that there was room for every one of the people of the country in it without the least interference with each other sometimes on getting down two of them would meet at the root and then they would smile to each other more sweetly than at any other time as much as to say ah you've been up there too  one day he was sitting on one of the outer branches of the tree looking southwards after his home far away was a blue shining sea dotted with gleaming and sparkling specks of white those were the icebergs nearer he saw a great range of snow-capped mountains and down below him the lovely meadow-grass of the country with the stream flowing and flowing through it away towards the sea as he looked he began to wonder for the whole country lay beneath him like a map and that which was near him looked just as small as that which he knew to be miles away the ridge of ice which encircled it appeared but a few yards off and no larger than the row of pebbles with which a child will mark out the boundaries of the kingdom he has appropriated on the sea-shore he thought he could distinguish the vapoury form of north wind seated as he had left her on the other side hastily he descended the tree and to his amazement found that the map or model of the country still lay at his feet he stood in it with one stride he had crossed the river with another he had reached the ridge of ice with the third he stepped over its peaks and sank wearily down at north wind's knees for there she sat on her doorstep the peaks of the great ridge of ice were as lofty as ever behind her and the country at her back had vanished from diamond's view  north wind was as still as diamond had left her her pale face was white as the snow and her motionless eyes were as blue as the caverns in the ice but the instant diamond touched her her face began to change like that of one waking from sleep light began to glimmer from the blue of her eyes  a moment more and she laid her hand on diamond's head and began playing with his hair diamond took hold of her hand and laid his face to it she gave a little start  how very alive you are child she murmured come nearer to me  by the help of the stones all around he clambered up beside her and laid himself against her bosom she gave a great sigh slowly lifted her arms and slowly folded them about him until she clasped him close yet a moment and she roused herself and came quite awake and the cold of her bosom which had pierced diamond's bones vanished  have you been sitting here ever since i went through you dear north wind asked diamond stroking her hand  yes she answered looking at him with her old kindness  ain't you very tired  no i've often had to sit longer do you know how long you have been  oh years and years answered diamond  you have just been seven days returned north wind  i thought i had been a hundred years exclaimed diamond  yes i daresay replied north wind you've been away from here seven days but how long you may have been in there is quite another thing behind my back and before my face things are so different they don't go at all by the same rule  i'm very glad said diamond after thinking a while  why asked north wind  because i've been such a long time there and such a little while away from mother why she won't be expecting me home from sandwich yet  no but we mustn't talk any longer i've got my orders now and we must be off in a few minutes  next moment diamond found himself sitting alone on the rock north wind had vanished a creature like a great humble-bee or cockchafer flew past his face but it could be neither for there were no insects amongst the ice it passed him again and again flying in circles around him and he concluded that it must be north wind herself no bigger than tom thumb when his mother put him in the nutshell lined with flannel but she was no longer vapoury and thin she was solid although tiny a moment more and she perched on his shoulder  come along diamond she said in his ear in the smallest and highest of treble voices it is time we were setting out for sandwich  diamond could just see her by turning his head towards his shoulder as far as he could but only with one eye for his nose came between her and the other  won't you take me in your arms and carry me he said in a whisper for he knew she did not like a loud voice when she was small  ah you ungrateful boy returned north wind smiling how dare you make game of me yes i will carry you but you shall walk a bit for your impertinence first come along  she jumped from his shoulder but when diamond looked for her upon the ground he could see nothing but a little spider with long legs that made its way over the ice towards the south it ran very fast indeed for a spider but diamond ran a long way before it and then waited for it it was up with him sooner than he had expected however and it had grown a good deal and the spider grew and grew and went faster and faster till all at once diamond discovered that it was not a spider but a weasel and away glided the weasel and away went diamond after it and it took all the run there was in him to keep up with the weasel and the weasel grew and grew and grew till all at once diamond saw that the weasel was not a weasel but a cat and away went the cat and diamond after it and when he had run half a mile he found the cat waiting for him sitting up and washing her face not to lose time and away went the cat again and diamond after it but the next time he came up with the cat the cat was not a cat but a hunting-leopard and the hunting-leopard grew to a jaguar all covered with spots like eyes and the jaguar grew to a bengal tiger and at none of them was diamond afraid for he had been at north wind's back and he could be afraid of her no longer whatever she did or grew and the tiger flew over the snow in a straight line for the south growing less and less to diamond's eyes till it was only a black speck upon the whiteness and then it vanished altogether and now diamond felt that he would rather not run any farther and that the ice had got very rough besides he was near the precipices that bounded the sea so he slackened his pace to a walk saying aloud to himself   when north wind has punished me enough for making game of her she will come back to me i know she will for i can't go much farther without her  you dear boy it was only in fun here i am said north wind's voice behind him  diamond turned and saw her as he liked best to see her standing beside him a tall lady  where's the tiger he asked for he knew all the creatures from a picture book that miss coleman had given him but of course he added you were the tiger i was puzzled and forgot i saw it such a long way off before me and there you were behind me it's so odd you know  it must look very odd to you diamond  i see that but it is no more odd to me than to break an old pine in two  well that's odd enough remarked diamond  so it is i forgot well none of these things are odder to me than it is to you to eat bread and butter  well that's odd too when i think of it persisted diamond i should just like a slice of bread and butter i'm afraid to say how long it is how long it seems to me that is since i had anything to eat  come then said north wind stooping and holding out her arms you shall have some bread and butter very soon i am glad to find you want some  diamond held up his arms to meet hers and was safe upon her bosom north wind bounded into the air her tresses began to lift and rise and spread and stream and flow and flutter and with a roar from her hair and an answering roar from one of the great glaciers beside them whose slow torrent tumbled two or three icebergs at once into the waves at their feet north wind and diamond went flying southwards     chapter xii who met diamond at sandwich   as they flew so fast they went that the sea slid away from under them like a great web of shot silk blue shot with grey and green shot with purple they went so fast that the stars themselves appeared to sail away past them overhead like golden boats on a blue sea turned upside down and they went so fast that diamond himself went the other way as fast i mean he went fast asleep in north wind's arms  when he woke a face was bending over him but it was not north wind's it was his mother's he put out his arms to her and she clasped him to her bosom and burst out crying diamond kissed her again and again to make her stop perhaps kissing is the best thing for crying but it will not always stop it  what is the matter mother he said  oh diamond my darling you have been so ill she sobbed  no mother dear i've only been at the back of the north wind  returned diamond  i thought you were dead said his mother  but that moment the doctor came in  oh there said the doctor with gentle cheerfulness we're better to-day i see  then he drew the mother aside and told her not to talk to diamond or to mind what he might say for he must be kept as quiet as possible and indeed diamond was not much inclined to talk for he felt very strange and weak which was little wonder seeing that all the time he had been away he had only sucked a few lumps of ice and there could not be much nourishment in them  now while he is lying there getting strong again with chicken broth and other nice things i will tell my readers what had been taking place at his home for they ought to be told it  they may have forgotten that miss coleman was in a very poor state of health now there were three reasons for this in the first place her lungs were not strong in the second place there was a gentleman somewhere who had not behaved very well to her in the third place she had not anything particular to do these three nots together are enough to make a lady very ill indeed of course she could not help the first cause but if the other two causes had not existed that would have been of little consequence she would only have to be a little careful the second she could not help quite but if she had had anything to do and had done it well it would have been very difficult for any man to behave badly to her and for this third cause of her illness if she had had anything to do that was worth doing she might have borne his bad behaviour so that even that would not have made her ill it is not always easy i confess to find something to do that is worth doing but the most difficult things are constantly being done and she might have found something if she had tried her fault lay in this that she had not tried but to be sure her father and mother were to blame that they had never set her going only then again nobody had told her father and mother that they ought to set her going in that direction so as none of them would find it out of themselves north wind had to teach them  we know that north wind was very busy that night on which she left diamond in the cathedral she had in a sense been blowing through and through the colemans' house the whole of the night first miss coleman's maid had left a chink of her mistress's window open thinking she had shut it and north wind had wound a few of her hairs round the lady's throat she was considerably worse the next morning again the ship which north wind had sunk that very night belonged to mr coleman nor will my readers understand what a heavy loss this was to him until i have informed them that he had been getting poorer and poorer for some time he was not so successful in his speculations as he had been for he speculated a great deal more than was right and it was time he should be pulled up it is a hard thing for a rich man to grow poor but it is an awful thing for him to grow dishonest and some kinds of speculation lead a man deep into dishonesty before he thinks what he is about poverty will not make a man worthless he may be worth a great deal more when he is poor than he was when he was rich but dishonesty goes very far indeed to make a man of no value a thing to be thrown out in the dust-hole of the creation like a bit of a broken basin or a dirty rag so north wind had to look after mr coleman and try to make an honest man of him so she sank the ship which was his last venture and he was what himself and his wife and the world called ruined  nor was this all yet for on board that vessel miss coleman's lover was a passenger and when the news came that the vessel had gone down and that all on board had perished we may be sure she did not think the loss of their fine house and garden and furniture the greatest misfortune in the world  of course the trouble did not end with mr coleman and his family nobody can suffer alone when the cause of suffering is most deeply hidden in the heart and nobody knows anything about it but the man himself he must be a great and a good man indeed such as few of us have known if the pain inside him does not make him behave so as to cause all about him to be more or less uncomfortable but when a man brings money-troubles on himself by making haste to be rich then most of the people he has to do with must suffer in the same way with himself the elm-tree which north wind blew down that very night as if small and great trials were to be gathered in one heap crushed miss coleman's pretty summer-house  just so the fall of mr coleman crushed the little family that lived over his coach-house and stable before diamond was well enough to be taken home there was no home for him to go to mr coleman or his creditors for i do not know the particulars had sold house carriage horses furniture and everything he and his wife and daughter and mrs crump had gone to live in a small house in hoxton where he would be unknown and whence he could walk to his place of business in the city for he was not an old man and hoped yet to retrieve his fortunes let us hope that he lived to retrieve his honesty the tail of which had slipped through his fingers to the very last joint if not beyond it  of course diamond's father had nothing to do for a time but it was not so hard for him to have nothing to do as it was for miss coleman he wrote to his wife that if her sister would keep her there till he got a place it would be better for them and he would be greatly obliged to her meantime the gentleman who had bought the house had allowed his furniture to remain where it was for a little while  diamond's aunt was quite willing to keep them as long as she could and indeed diamond was not yet well enough to be moved with safety  when he had recovered so far as to be able to go out one day his mother got her sister's husband who had a little pony-cart to carry them down to the sea-shore and leave them there for a few hours he had some business to do further on at ramsgate and would pick them up as he returned a whiff of the sea-air would do them both good she said and she thought besides she could best tell diamond what had happened if she had him quite to herself     chapter xiii the seaside   diamond and his mother sat down upon the edge of the rough grass that bordered the sand the sun was just far enough past its highest not to shine in their eyes when they looked eastward a sweet little wind blew on their left side and comforted the mother without letting her know what it was that comforted her away before them stretched the sparkling waters of the ocean every wave of which flashed out its own delight back in the face of the great sun which looked down from the stillness of its blue house with glorious silent face upon its flashing children on each hand the shore rounded outwards forming a little bay there were no white cliffs here as further north and south and the place was rather dreary but the sky got at them so much the better not a house not a creature was within sight dry sand was about their feet and under them thin wiry grass that just managed to grow out of the poverty-stricken shore  oh dear said diamond's mother with a deep sigh it's a sad world  is it said diamond i didn't know  how should you know child you've been too well taken care of i trust  oh yes i have returned diamond i'm sorry i thought you were taken care of too i thought my father took care of you i will ask him about it i think he must have forgotten  dear boy said his mother your father's the best man in the world  so i thought returned diamond with triumph i was sure of it well doesn't he take very good care of you  yes yes he does answered his mother bursting into tears but who's to take care of him and how is he to take care of us if he's got nothing to eat himself  oh dear said diamond with a gasp hasn't he got anything to eat oh i must go home to him  no no child he's not come to that yet but what's to become of us i don't know  are you very hungry mother there's the basket i thought you put something to eat in it  o you darling stupid i didn't say i was hungry returned his mother smiling through her tears  then i don't understand you at all said diamond do tell me what's the matter  there are people in the world who have nothing to eat diamond  then i suppose they don't stop in it any longer they they what you call die don't they  yes they do how would you like that  i don't know i never tried but i suppose they go where they get something to eat  like enough they don't want it said his mother petulantly  that's all right then said diamond thinking i daresay more than he chose to put in words  is it though poor boy how little you know about things mr coleman's lost all his money and your father has nothing to do and we shall have nothing to eat by and by  are you sure mother  sure of what  sure that we shall have nothing to eat  no thank heaven i'm not sure of it i hope not  then i can't understand it mother there's a piece of gingerbread in the basket i know  o you little bird you have no more sense than a sparrow that picks what it wants and never thinks of the winter and the frost and the snow  ah yes i see but the birds get through the winter don't they  some of them fall dead on the ground  they must die some time they wouldn't like to be birds always would you mother  what a child it is thought his mother but she said nothing  oh now i remember diamond went on father told me that day i went to epping forest with him that the rose-bushes and the may-bushes and the holly-bushes were the bird's barns for there were the hips and the haws and the holly-berries all ready for the winter  yes that's all very true so you see the birds are provided for but there are no such barns for you and me diamond  ain't there  no we've got to work for our bread  then let's go and work said diamond getting up  it's no use we've not got anything to do  then let's wait  then we shall starve  no there's the basket do you know mother i think i shall call that basket the barn  it's not a very big one and when it's empty where are we then  at auntie's cupboard returned diamond promptly  but we can't eat auntie's things all up and leave her to starve  no no we'll go back to father before that he'll have found a cupboard somewhere by that time  how do you know that  i don't know it but i haven't got even a cupboard and i've always had plenty to eat i've heard you say i had too much sometimes  but i tell you that's because i've had a cupboard for you child  and when yours was empty auntie opened hers  but that can't go on  how do you know i think there must be a big cupboard somewhere out of which the little cupboards are filled you know mother  well i wish i could find the door of that cupboard said his mother but the same moment she stopped and was silent for a good while i cannot tell whether diamond knew what she was thinking but i think i know she had heard something at church the day before which came back upon her something like this that she hadn't to eat for tomorrow as well as for to-day and that what was not wanted couldn't be missed so instead of saying anything more she stretched out her hand for the basket and she and diamond had their dinner  and diamond did enjoy it for the drive and the fresh air had made him quite hungry and he did not like his mother trouble himself about what they should dine off that day week the fact was he had lived so long without any food at all at the back of the north wind that he knew quite well that food was not essential to existence that in fact under certain circumstances people could live without it well enough  his mother did not speak much during their dinner after it was over she helped him to walk about a little but he was not able for much and soon got tired he did not get fretful though he was too glad of having the sun and the wind again to fret because he could not run about he lay down on the dry sand and his mother covered him with a shawl she then sat by his side and took a bit of work from her pocket but diamond felt rather sleepy and turned on his side and gazed sleepily over the sand a few yards off he saw something fluttering  what is that mother he said  only a bit of paper she answered  it flutters more than a bit of paper would i think said diamond  i'll go and see if you like said his mother my eyes are none of the best  so she rose and went and found that they were both right for it was a little book partly buried in the sand but several of its leaves were clear of the sand and these the wind kept blowing about in a very flutterful manner she took it up and brought it to diamond  what is it mother he asked  some nursery rhymes i think she answered  i'm too sleepy said diamond do read some of them to me  yes i will she said and began one but this is such nonsense  she said again i will try to find a better one  she turned the leaves searching but three times with sudden puffs the wind blew the leaves rustling back to the same verses  do read that one said diamond who seemed to be of the same mind as the wind it sounded very nice i am sure it is a good one  so his mother thought it might amuse him though she couldn't find any sense in it she never thought he might understand it although she could not  now i do not exactly know what the mother read but this is what diamond heard or thought afterwards that he had heard he was however as i have said very sleepy and when he thought he understood the verses he may have been only dreaming better ones this is how they went   i know a river whose waters run asleep run run ever singing in the shallows dumb in the hollows sleeping so deep and all the swallows that dip their feathers in the hollows or in the shallows are the merriest swallows of all for the nests they bake with the clay they cake with the water they shake from their wings that rake the water out of the shallows or the hollows will hold together in any weather and so the swallows are the merriest fellows and have the merriest children and are built so narrow like the head of an arrow to cut the air and go just where the nicest water is flowing and the nicest dust is blowing for each so narrow like head of an arrow is only a barrow to carry the mud he makes from the nicest water flowing and the nicest dust that is blowing to build his nest for her he loves best with the nicest cakes which the sunshine bakes all for their merry children all so callow with beaks that follow gaping and hollow wider and wider after their father or after their mother the food-provider who brings them a spider or a worm the poor hider down in the earth so there's no dearth for their beaks as yellow as the buttercups growing beside the flowing of the singing river always and ever growing and blowing for fast as the sheep awake or asleep crop them and crop them they cannot stop them but up they creep and on they go blowing and so with the daisies the little white praises they grow and they blow and they spread out their crown and they praise the sun and when he goes down their praising is done and they fold up their crown and they sleep every one till over the plain he's shining amain and they're at it again praising and praising such low songs raising that no one hears them but the sun who rears them and the sheep that bite them are the quietest sheep awake or asleep with the merriest bleat and the little lambs are the merriest lambs they forget to eat for the frolic in their feet and the lambs and their dams are the whitest sheep with the woolliest wool and the longest wool and the trailingest tails and they shine like snow in the grasses that grow by the singing river that sings for ever and the sheep and the lambs are merry for ever because the river sings and they drink it and the lambs and their dams are quiet and white because of their diet for what they bite is buttercups yellow and daisies white and grass as green as the river can make it with wind as mellow to kiss it and shake it as never was seen but here in the hollows beside the river where all the swallows are merriest of fellows for the nests they make with the clay they cake in the sunshine bake till they are like bone as dry in the wind as a marble stone so firm they bind the grass in the clay that dries in the wind the sweetest wind that blows by the river flowing for ever but never you find whence comes the wind that blows on the hollows and over the shallows where dip the swallows alive it blows the life as it goes awake or asleep into the river that sings as it flows and the life it blows into the sheep awake or asleep with the woolliest wool and the trailingest tails and it never fails gentle and cool to wave the wool and to toss the grass as the lambs and the sheep over it pass and tug and bite with their teeth so white and then with the sweep of their trailing tails smooth it again and it grows amain and amain it grows and the wind as it blows tosses the swallows over the hollows and down on the shallows till every feather doth shake and quiver and all their feathers go all together blowing the life and the joy so rife into the swallows that skim the shallows and have the yellowest children for the wind that blows is the life of the river flowing for ever that washes the grasses still as it passes and feeds the daisies the little white praises and buttercups bonny so golden and sunny with butter and honey that whiten the sheep awake or asleep that nibble and bite and grow whiter than white and merry and quiet on the sweet diet fed by the river and tossed for ever by the wind that tosses the swallow that crosses over the shallows dipping his wings to gather the water and bake the cake that the wind shall make as hard as a bone as dry as a stone it's all in the wind that blows from behind and all in the river that flows for ever and all in the grasses and the white daisies and the merry sheep awake or asleep and the happy swallows skimming the shallows and it's all in the wind that blows from behind   here diamond became aware that his mother had stopped reading  why don't you go on mother dear he asked  it's such nonsense said his mother i believe it would go on for ever  that's just what it did said diamond  what did she asked  why the river that's almost the very tune it used to sing  his mother was frightened for she thought the fever was coming on again so she did not contradict him  who made that poem asked diamond  i don't know she answered some silly woman for her children i suppose and then thought it good enough to print  she must have been at the back of the north wind some time or other anyhow said diamond she couldn't have got a hold of it anywhere else that's just how it went and he began to chant bits of it here and there but his mother said nothing for fear of making him worse and she was very glad indeed when she saw her brother-in-law jogging along in his little cart they lifted diamond in and got up themselves and away they went home again home again home again as diamond sang but he soon grew quiet and before they reached sandwich he was fast asleep and dreaming of the country at the back of the north wind     chapter xiv old diamond   after this diamond recovered so fast that in a few days he was quite able to go home as soon as his father had a place for them to go now his father having saved a little money and finding that no situation offered itself had been thinking over a new plan a strange occurrence it was which turned his thoughts in that direction he had a friend in the bloomsbury region who lived by letting out cabs and horses to the cabmen this man happening to meet him one day as he was returning from an unsuccessful application said to him   why don't you set up for yourself now in the cab line i mean  i haven't enough for that answered diamond's father  you must have saved a goodish bit i should think just come home with me now and look at a horse i can let you have cheap i bought him only a few weeks ago thinking he'd do for a hansom but i was wrong he's got bone enough for a waggon but a waggon ain't a hansom he ain't got go enough for a hansom you see parties as takes hansoms wants to go like the wind and he ain't got wind enough for he ain't so young as he once was but for a four-wheeler as takes families and their luggages he's the very horse he'd carry a small house any day i bought him cheap and i'll sell him cheap  oh i don't want him said diamond's father a body must have time to think over an affair of so much importance and there's the cab too that would come to a deal of money  i could fit you there i daresay said his friend but come and look at the animal anyhow  since i lost my own old pair as was mr coleman's said diamond's father turning to accompany the cab-master i ain't almost got the heart to look a horse in the face it's a thousand pities to part man and horse  so it is returned his friend sympathetically  but what was the ex-coachman's delight when on going into the stable where his friend led him he found the horse he wanted him to buy was no other than his own old diamond grown very thin and bony and long-legged as if they had been doing what they could to fit him for hansom work  he ain't a hansom horse said diamond's father indignantly  well you're right he ain't handsome but he's a good un said his owner  who says he ain't handsome he's one of the handsomest horses a gentleman's coachman ever druv said diamond's father remarking to himself under his breath though i says it as shouldn't for he did not feel inclined all at once to confess that his own old horse could have sunk so low  well said his friend all i say is there's a animal for you as strong as a church an'll go like a train leastways a parly he added correcting himself  but the coachman had a lump in his throat and tears in his eyes for the old horse hearing his voice had turned his long neck and when his old friend went up to him and laid his hand on his side he whinnied for joy and laid his big head on his master's breast this settled the matter the coachman's arms were round the horse's neck in a moment and he fairly broke down and cried the cab-master had never been so fond of a horse himself as to hug him like that but he saw in a moment how it was and he must have been a good-hearted fellow for i never heard of such an idea coming into the head of any other man with a horse to sell  instead of putting something on to the price because he was now pretty sure of selling him he actually took a pound off what he had meant to ask for him saying to himself it was a shame to part old friends  diamond's father as soon as he came to himself turned and asked how much he wanted for the horse  i see you're old friends said the owner  it's my own old diamond i liked him far the best of the pair though the other was good you ain't got him too have you  no nothing in the stable to match him there  i believe you said the coachman but you'll be wanting a long price for him i know  no not so much i bought him cheap and as i say he ain't for my work  the end of it was that diamond's father bought old diamond again along with a four-wheeled cab and as there were some rooms to be had over the stable he took them wrote to his wife to come home and set up as a cabman     chapter xv the mews   it was late in the afternoon when diamond and his mother and the baby reached london i was so full of diamond that i forgot to tell you a baby had arrived in the meantime his father was waiting for them with his own cab but they had not told diamond who the horse was for his father wanted to enjoy the pleasure of his surprise when he found it out he got in with his mother without looking at the horse and his father having put up diamond's carpet-bag and his mother's little trunk got upon the box himself and drove off and diamond was quite proud of riding home in his father's own carriage but when he got to the mews he could not help being a little dismayed at first and if he had never been to the back of the north wind i am afraid he would have cried a little but instead of that he said to himself it was a fine thing all the old furniture was there and instead of helping his mother to be miserable at the change he began to find out all the advantages of the place for every place has some advantages and they are always better worth knowing than the disadvantages certainly the weather was depressing for a thick dull persistent rain was falling by the time they reached home but happily the weather is very changeable and besides there was a good fire burning in the room which their neighbour with the drunken husband had attended to for them and the tea-things were put out and the kettle was boiling on the fire and with a good fire and tea and bread and butter things cannot be said to be miserable  diamond's father and mother were notwithstanding rather miserable and diamond began to feel a kind of darkness beginning to spread over his own mind but the same moment he said to himself this will never do i can't give in to this i've been to the back of the north wind things go right there and so i must try to get things to go right here i've got to fight the miserable things they shan't make me miserable if i can help it i do not mean that he thought these very words they are perhaps too grown-up for him to have thought but they represent the kind of thing that was in his heart and his head and when heart and head go together nothing can stand before them  what nice bread and butter this is said diamond  i'm glad you like it my dear said his father i bought the butter myself at the little shop round the corner  it's very nice thank you father oh there's baby waking i'll take him  sit still diamond said his mother go on with your bread and butter you're not strong enough to lift him yet  so she took the baby herself and set him on her knee then diamond began to amuse him and went on till the little fellow was shrieking with laughter for the baby's world was his mother's arms and the drizzling rain and the dreary mews and even his father's troubled face could not touch him what cared baby for the loss of a hundred situations yet neither father nor mother thought him hard-hearted because he crowed and laughed in the middle of their troubles on the contrary his crowing and laughing were infectious his little heart was so full of merriment that it could not hold it all and it ran over into theirs father and mother began to laugh too and diamond laughed till he had a fit of coughing which frightened his mother and made them all stop his father took the baby and his mother put him to bed  but it was indeed a change to them all not only from sandwich but from their old place instead of the great river where the huge barges with their mighty brown and yellow sails went tacking from side to side like little pleasure-skiffs and where the long thin boats shot past with eight and sometimes twelve rowers their windows now looked out upon a dirty paved yard and there was no garden more for diamond to run into when he pleased with gay flowers about his feet and solemn sun-filled trees over his head neither was there a wooden wall at the back of his bed with a hole in it for north wind to come in at when she liked indeed there was such a high wall and there were so many houses about the mews that north wind seldom got into the place at all except when something must be done and she had a grand cleaning out like other housewives while the partition at the head of diamond's new bed only divided it from the room occupied by a cabman who drank too much beer and came home chiefly to quarrel with his wife and pinch his children it was dreadful to diamond to hear the scolding and the crying but it could not make him miserable because he had been at the back of the north wind  if my reader find it hard to believe that diamond should be so good he must remember that he had been to the back of the north wind if he never knew a boy so good did he ever know a boy that had been to the back of the north wind it was not in the least strange of diamond to behave as he did on the contrary it was thoroughly sensible of him  we shall see how he got on     chapter xvi diamond makes a beginning   the wind blew loud but diamond slept a deep sleep and never heard it my own impression is that every time when diamond slept well and remembered nothing about it in the morning he had been all that night at the back of the north wind i am almost sure that was how he woke so refreshed and felt so quiet and hopeful all the day indeed he said this much though not to me that always when he woke from such a sleep there was a something in his mind he could not tell what could not tell whether it was the last far-off sounds of the river dying away in the distance or some of the words of the endless song his mother had read to him on the sea-shore sometimes he thought it must have been the twittering of the swallows over the shallows you know but it may have been the chirping of the dingy sparrows picking up their breakfast in the yard how can i tell i don't know what i know i only know what i think and to tell the truth i am more for the swallows than the sparrows when he knew he was coming awake he would sometimes try hard to keep hold of the words of what seemed a new song one he had not heard before a song in which the words and the music somehow appeared to be all one but even when he thought he had got them well fixed in his mind ever as he came awaker as he would say one line faded away out of it and then another and then another till at last there was nothing left but some lovely picture of water or grass or daisies or something else very common but with all the commonness polished off it and the lovely soul of it which people so seldom see and alas yet seldomer believe in shining out but after that he would sing the oddest loveliest little songs to the baby of his own making his mother said but diamond said he did not make them they were made somewhere inside him and he knew nothing about them till they were coming out  when he woke that first morning he got up at once saying to himself i've been ill long enough and have given a great deal of trouble i must try and be of use now and help my mother when he went into her room he found her lighting the fire and his father just getting out of bed they had only the one room besides the little one not much more than a closet in which diamond slept he began at once to set things to rights but the baby waking up he took him and nursed him till his mother had got the breakfast ready she was looking gloomy and his father was silent and indeed except diamond had done all he possibly could to keep out the misery that was trying to get in at doors and windows he too would have grown miserable and then they would have been all miserable together but to try to make others comfortable is the only way to get right comfortable ourselves and that comes partly of not being able to think so much about ourselves when we are helping other people for our selves will always do pretty well if we don't pay them too much attention our selves are like some little children who will be happy enough so long as they are left to their own games but when we begin to interfere with them and make them presents of too nice playthings or too many sweet things they begin at once to fret and spoil  why diamond child said his mother at last you're as good to your mother as if you were a girl nursing the baby and toasting the bread and sweeping up the hearth i declare a body would think you had been among the fairies  could diamond have had greater praise or greater pleasure you see when he forgot his self his mother took care of his self and loved and praised his self our own praises poison our selves and puff and swell them up till they lose all shape and beauty and become like great toadstools but the praises of father or mother do our selves good and comfort them and make them beautiful they never do them any harm if they do any harm it comes of our mixing some of our own praises with them and that turns them nasty and slimy and poisonous  when his father had finished his breakfast which he did rather in a hurry he got up and went down into the yard to get out his horse and put him to the cab  won't you come and see the cab diamond he said  yes please father if mother can spare me a minute answered diamond  bless the child i don't want him said his mother cheerfully  but as he was following his father out of the door she called him back  diamond just hold the baby one minute i have something to say to your father  so diamond sat down again took the baby in his lap and began poking his face into its little body laughing and singing all the while so that the baby crowed like a little bantam and what he sang was something like this such nonsense to those that couldn't understand it but not to the baby who got all the good in the world out of it   baby's a-sleeping wake up baby for all the swallows are the merriest fellows and have the yellowest children who would go sleeping and snore like a gaby disturbing his mother and father and brother and all a-boring their ears with his snoring snoring snoring for himself and no other for himself in particular wake up baby sit up perpendicular hark to the gushing hark to the rushing where the sheep are the woolliest and the lambs the unruliest and their tails the whitest and their eyes the brightest and baby's the bonniest and baby's the funniest and baby's the shiniest and baby's the tiniest and baby's the merriest and baby's the worriest of all the lambs that plague their dams and mother's the whitest of all the dams that feed the lambs that go crop-cropping without stop-stopping and father's the best of all the swallows that build their nest out of the shining shallows and he has the merriest children that's baby and diamond and diamond and baby and baby and diamond and diamond and baby    here diamond's knees went off in a wild dance which tossed the baby about and shook the laughter out of him in immoderate peals his mother had been listening at the door to the last few lines of his song and came in with the tears in her eyes she took the baby from him gave him a kiss and told him to run to his father  by the time diamond got into the yard the horse was between the shafts and his father was looping the traces on diamond went round to look at the horse the sight of him made him feel very queer he did not know much about different horses and all other horses than their own were very much the same to him but he could not make it out this was diamond and it wasn't diamond diamond didn't hang his head like that yet the head that was hanging was very like the one that diamond used to hold so high diamond's bones didn't show through his skin like that but the skin they pushed out of shape so was very like diamond's skin and the bones might be diamond's bones for he had never seen the shape of them but when he came round in front of the old horse and he put out his long neck and began sniffing at him and rubbing his upper lip and his nose on him then diamond saw it could be no other than old diamond and he did just as his father had done before put his arms round his neck and cried but not much  ain't it jolly father he said was there ever anybody so lucky as me dear old diamond  and he hugged the horse again and kissed both his big hairy cheeks he could only manage one at a time however the other cheek was so far off on the other side of his big head  his father mounted the box with just the same air as diamond thought with which he had used to get upon the coach-box and diamond said to himself father's as grand as ever anyhow he had kept his brown livery-coat only his wife had taken the silver buttons off and put brass ones instead because they did not think it polite to mr coleman in his fallen fortunes to let his crest be seen upon the box of a cab old diamond had kept just his collar and that had the silver crest upon it still for his master thought nobody would notice that and so let it remain for a memorial of the better days of which it reminded him not unpleasantly seeing it had been by no fault either of his or of the old horse's that they had come down in the world together  oh father do let me drive a bit said diamond jumping up on the box beside him  his father changed places with him at once putting the reins into his hands diamond gathered them up eagerly  don't pull at his mouth said his father just feel at it gently to let him know you're there and attending to him that's what i call talking to him through the reins  yes father i understand said diamond then to the horse he said go on diamond and old diamond's ponderous bulk began at once to move to the voice of the little boy  but before they had reached the entrance of the mews another voice called after young diamond which in his turn he had to obey for it was that of his mother diamond diamond it cried and diamond pulled the reins and the horse stood still as a stone  husband said his mother coming up you're never going to trust him with the reins a baby like that  he must learn some day and he can't begin too soon i see already he's a born coachman said his father proudly and i don't see well how he could escape it for my father and my grandfather that's his great-grandfather was all coachmen i'm told so it must come natural to him any one would think besides you see old diamond's as proud of him as we are our own selves wife don't you see how he's turning round his ears with the mouths of them open for the first word he speaks to tumble in he's too well bred to turn his head you know  well but husband i can't do without him to-day everything's got to be done you know it's my first day here and there's that baby  bless you wife i never meant to take him away only to the bottom of endell street he can watch his way back  no thank you father not to-day said diamond mother wants me perhaps she'll let me go another day  very well my man said his father and took the reins which diamond was holding out to him  diamond got down a little disappointed of course and went with his mother who was too pleased to speak she only took hold of his hand as tight as if she had been afraid of his running away instead of glad that he would not leave her  now although they did not know it the owner of the stables the same man who had sold the horse to his father had been standing just inside one of the stable-doors with his hands in his pockets and had heard and seen all that passed and from that day john stonecrop took a great fancy to the little boy and this was the beginning of what came of it  the same evening just as diamond was feeling tired of the day's work and wishing his father would come home mr stonecrop knocked at the door his mother went and opened it  good evening ma'am said he is the little master in  yes to be sure he is at your service i'm sure mr stonecrop said his mother  no no ma'am it's i'm at his service i'm just a-going out with my own cab and if he likes to come with me he shall drive my old horse till he's tired  it's getting rather late for him said his mother thoughtfully you see he's been an invalid  diamond thought what a funny thing how could he have been an invalid when he did not even know what the word meant but of course his mother was right  oh well said mr stonecrop i can just let him drive through bloomsbury square and then he shall run home again  very good sir and i'm much obliged to you said his mother and diamond dancing with delight got his cap put his hand in mr stonecrop's and went with him to the yard where the cab was waiting he did not think the horse looked nearly so nice as diamond nor mr stonecrop nearly so grand as his father but he was none the less pleased he got up on the box and his new friend got up beside him  what's the horse's name whispered diamond as he took the reins from the man  it's not a nice name said mr stonecrop you needn't call him by it i didn't give it him he'll go well enough without it give the boy a whip jack i never carries one when i drive old    he didn't finish the sentence jack handed diamond a whip with which by holding it half down the stick he managed just to flack the haunches of the horse and away he went  mind the gate said mr stonecrop and diamond did mind the gate and guided the nameless horse through it in safety pulling him this way and that according as was necessary diamond learned to drive all the sooner that he had been accustomed to do what he was told and could obey the smallest hint in a moment nothing helps one to get on like that some people don't know how to do what they are told they have not been used to it and they neither understand quickly nor are able to turn what they do understand into action quickly with an obedient mind one learns the rights of things fast enough for it is the law of the universe and to obey is to understand  look out cried mr stonecrop as they were turning the corner into bloomsbury square  it was getting dusky now a cab was approaching rather rapidly from the opposite direction and diamond pulling aside and the other driver pulling up they only just escaped a collision then they knew each other  why diamond it's a bad beginning to run into your own father cried the driver  but father wouldn't it have been a bad ending to run into your own son said diamond in return and the two men laughed heartily  this is very kind of you i'm sure stonecrop said his father  not a bit he's a brave fellow and'll be fit to drive on his own hook in a week or two but i think you'd better let him drive you home now for his mother don't like his having over much of the night air and i promised not to take him farther than the square  come along then diamond said his father as he brought his cab up to the other and moved off the box to the seat beside it diamond jumped across caught at the reins said good-night and thank you mr stonecrop and drove away home feeling more of a man than he had ever yet had a chance of feeling in all his life nor did his father find it necessary to give him a single hint as to his driving only i suspect the fact that it was old diamond and old diamond on his way to his stable may have had something to do with young diamond's success  well child said his mother when he entered the room you've not been long gone  no mother here i am give me the baby  the baby's asleep said his mother  then give him to me and i'll lay him down  but as diamond took him he woke up and began to laugh for he was indeed one of the merriest children and no wonder for he was as plump as a plum-pudding and had never had an ache or a pain that lasted more than five minutes at a time diamond sat down with him and began to sing to him  baby baby babbing your father's gone a-cabbing to catch a shilling for its pence to make the baby babbing dance for old diamond's a duck they say he can swim but the duck of diamonds is baby that's him and of all the swallows the merriest fellows that bake their cake with the water they shake out of the river flowing for ever and make dust into clay on the shiniest day to build their nest father's the best and mother's the whitest and her eyes are the brightest of all the dams that watch their lambs cropping the grass where the waters pass singing for ever and of all the lambs with the shakingest tails and the jumpingest feet baby's the funniest baby's the bonniest and he never wails and he's always sweet and diamond's his nurse and diamond's his nurse and diamond's his nurse   when diamond's rhymes grew scarce he always began dancing the baby some people wondered that such a child could rhyme as he did but his rhymes were not very good for he was only trying to remember what he had heard the river sing at the back of the north wind     chapter xvii diamond goes on   diamond became a great favourite with all the men about the mews some may think it was not the best place in the world for him to be brought up in but it must have been for there he was at first he heard a good many rough and bad words but he did not like them and so they did him little harm he did not know in the least what they meant but there was something in the very sound of them and in the tone of voice in which they were said which diamond felt to be ugly so they did not even stick to him not to say get inside him he never took any notice of them and his face shone pure and good in the middle of them like a primrose in a hailstorm at first because his face was so quiet and sweet with a smile always either awake or asleep in his eyes and because he never heeded their ugly words and rough jokes they said he wasn't all there meaning that he was half an idiot whereas he was a great deal more there than they had the sense to see and before long the bad words found themselves ashamed to come out of the men's mouths when diamond was near the one would nudge the other to remind him that the boy was within hearing and the words choked themselves before they got any farther when they talked to him nicely he had always a good answer sometimes a smart one ready and that helped much to make them change their minds about him  one day jack gave him a curry-comb and a brush to try his hand upon old diamond's coat he used them so deftly so gently and yet so thoroughly as far as he could reach that the man could not help admiring him  you must make haste and grow he said it won't do to have a horse's belly clean and his back dirty you know  give me a leg said diamond and in a moment he was on the old horse's back with the comb and brush he sat on his withers and reaching forward as he ate his hay he curried and he brushed first at one side of his neck and then at the other when that was done he asked for a dressing-comb and combed his mane thoroughly then he pushed himself on to his back and did his shoulders as far down as he could reach then he sat on his croup and did his back and sides then he turned around like a monkey and attacked his hind-quarters and combed his tail this last was not so easy to manage for he had to lift it up and every now and then old diamond would whisk it out of his hands and once he sent the comb flying out of the stable door to the great amusement of the men but jack fetched it again and diamond began once more and did not leave off until he had done the whole business fairly well if not in a first-rate experienced fashion all the time the old horse went on eating his hay and but with an occasional whisk of his tail when diamond tickled or scratched him took no notice of the proceeding but that was all a pretence for he knew very well who it was that was perched on his back and rubbing away at him with the comb and the brush so he was quite pleased and proud and perhaps said to himself something like this   i'm a stupid old horse who can't brush his own coat but there's my young godson on my back cleaning me like an angel  i won't vouch for what the old horse was thinking for it is very difficult to find out what any old horse is thinking  oh dear said diamond when he had done i'm so tired  and he laid himself down at full length on old diamond's back  by this time all the men in the stable were gathered about the two diamonds and all much amused one of them lifted him down and from that time he was a greater favourite than before and if ever there was a boy who had a chance of being a prodigy at cab-driving diamond was that boy for the strife came to be who should have him out with him on the box  his mother however was a little shy of the company for him and besides she could not always spare him also his father liked to have him himself when he could so that he was more desired than enjoyed among the cabmen  but one way and another he did learn to drive all sorts of horses and to drive them well and that through the most crowded streets in london city of course there was the man always on the box-seat beside him but before long there was seldom the least occasion to take the reins from out of his hands for one thing he never got frightened and consequently was never in too great a hurry yet when the moment came for doing something sharp he was always ready for it i must once more remind my readers that he had been to the back of the north wind  one day which was neither washing-day nor cleaning-day nor marketing-day nor saturday nor monday upon which consequently diamond could be spared from the baby his father took him on his own cab after a stray job or two by the way they drew up in the row upon the stand between cockspur street and pall mall they waited a long time but nobody seemed to want to be carried anywhere by and by ladies would be going home from the academy exhibition and then there would be a chance of a job  though to be sure said diamond's father with what truth i cannot say but he believed what he said some ladies is very hard and keeps you to the bare sixpence a mile when every one knows that ain't enough to keep a family and a cab upon to be sure it's the law but mayhap they may get more law than they like some day themselves  as it was very hot diamond's father got down to have a glass of beer himself and give another to the old waterman he left diamond on the box  a sudden noise got up and diamond looked round to see what was the matter  there was a crossing near the cab-stand where a girl was sweeping some rough young imps had picked a quarrel with her and were now hauling at her broom to get it away from her but as they did not pull all together she was holding it against them scolding and entreating alternately  diamond was off his box in a moment and running to the help of the girl he got hold of the broom at her end and pulled along with her but the boys proceeded to rougher measures and one of them hit diamond on the nose and made it bleed and as he could not let go the broom to mind his nose he was soon a dreadful figure but presently his father came back and missing diamond looked about he had to look twice however before he could be sure that that was his boy in the middle of the tumult he rushed in and sent the assailants flying in all directions the girl thanked diamond and began sweeping as if nothing had happened while his father led him away with the help of old tom the waterman he was soon washed into decency and his father set him on the box again perfectly satisfied with the account he gave of the cause of his being in a fray  i couldn't let them behave so to a poor girl could i father he said  certainly not diamond said his father quite pleased for diamond's father was a gentleman  a moment after up came the girl running with her broom over her shoulder and calling cab there cab  diamond's father turned instantly for he was the foremost in the rank and followed the girl one or two other passing cabs heard the cry and made for the place but the girl had taken care not to call till she was near enough to give her friends the first chance when they reached the curbstone who should it be waiting for the cab but mrs and miss coleman they did not look at the cabman however the girl opened the door for them they gave her the address and a penny she told the cabman and away they drove  when they reached the house diamond's father got down and rang the bell as he opened the door of the cab he touched his hat as he had been wont to do the ladies both stared for a moment and then exclaimed together   why joseph can it be you  yes ma'am yes miss answered he again touching his hat with all the respect he could possibly put into the action it's a lucky day which i see you once more upon it  who would have thought it said mrs coleman it's changed times for both of us joseph and it's not very often we can have a cab even but you see my daughter is still very poorly and she can't bear the motion of the omnibuses indeed we meant to walk a bit first before we took a cab but just at the corner for as hot as the sun was a cold wind came down the street and i saw that miss coleman must not face it but to think we should have fallen upon you of all the cabmen in london i didn't know you had got a cab  well you see ma'am i had a chance of buying the old horse and i couldn't resist him there he is looking at you ma'am nobody knows the sense in that head of his  the two ladies went near to pat the horse and then they noticed diamond on the box  why you've got both diamonds with you said miss coleman how do you do diamond  diamond lifted his cap and answered politely  he'll be fit to drive himself before long said his father proudly the old horse is a-teaching of him  well he must come and see us now you've found us out where do you live  diamond's father gave the ladies a ticket with his name and address printed on it and then mrs coleman took out her purse saying   and what's your fare joseph  no thank you ma'am said joseph it was your own old horse as took you and me you paid long ago  he jumped on his box before she could say another word and with a parting salute drove off leaving them on the pavement with the maid holding the door for them  it was a long time now since diamond had seen north wind or even thought much about her and as his father drove along he was thinking not about her but about the crossing-sweeper and was wondering what made him feel as if he knew her quite well when he could not remember anything of her but a picture arose in his mind of a little girl running before the wind and dragging her broom after her and from that by degrees he recalled the whole adventure of the night when he got down from north wind's back in a london street but he could not quite satisfy himself whether the whole affair was not a dream which he had dreamed when he was a very little boy only he had been to the back of the north wind since there could be no doubt of that for when he woke every morning he always knew that he had been there again and as he thought and thought he recalled another thing that had happened that morning which although it seemed a mere accident might have something to do with what had happened since his father had intended going on the stand at king's cross that morning and had turned into gray's inn lane to drive there when they found the way blocked up and upon inquiry were informed that a stack of chimneys had been blown down in the night and had fallen across the road they were just clearing the rubbish away diamond's father turned and made for charing cross  that night the father and mother had a great deal to talk about  poor things said the mother it's worse for them than it is for us you see they've been used to such grand things and for them to come down to a little poky house like that it breaks my heart to think of it  i don't know said diamond thoughtfully whether mrs coleman had bells on her toes  what do you mean child said his mother  she had rings on her fingers anyhow returned diamond  of course she had as any lady would what has that to do with it  when we were down at sandwich said diamond you said you would have to part with your mother's ring now we were poor  bless the child he forgets nothing said his mother really diamond a body would need to mind what they say to you  why said diamond i only think about it  that's just why said the mother  why is that why persisted diamond for he had not yet learned that grown-up people are not often so much grown up that they never talk like children and spoilt ones too  mrs coleman is none so poor as all that yet no thank heaven she's not come to that  is it a great disgrace to be poor asked diamond because of the tone in which his mother had spoken  but his mother whether conscience-stricken i do not know hurried him away to bed where after various attempts to understand her resumed and resumed again in spite of invading sleep he was conquered at last and gave in murmuring over and over to himself why is why but getting no answer to the question     chapter xviii the drunken cabman   a few nights after this diamond woke up suddenly believing he heard north wind thundering along but it was something quite different south wind was moaning round the chimneys to be sure for she was not very happy that night but it was not her voice that had wakened diamond her voice would only have lulled him the deeper asleep it was a loud angry voice now growling like that of a beast now raving like that of a madman and when diamond came a little wider awake he knew that it was the voice of the drunken cabman the wall of whose room was at the head of his bed it was anything but pleasant to hear but he could not help hearing it at length there came a cry from the woman and then a scream from the baby thereupon diamond thought it time that somebody did something and as himself was the only somebody at hand he must go and see whether he could not do something so he got up and put on part of his clothes and went down the stair for the cabman's room did not open upon their stair and he had to go out into the yard and in at the next door this fortunately the cabman being drunk had left open by the time he reached their stair all was still except the voice of the crying baby which guided him to the right door he opened it softly and peeped in there leaning back in a chair with his arms hanging down by his sides and his legs stretched out before him and supported on his heels sat the drunken cabman his wife lay in her clothes upon the bed sobbing and the baby was wailing in the cradle it was very miserable altogether  now the way most people do when they see anything very miserable is to turn away from the sight and try to forget it but diamond began as usual to try to destroy the misery the little boy was just as much one of god's messengers as if he had been an angel with a flaming sword going out to fight the devil the devil he had to fight just then was misery and the way he fought him was the very best like a wise soldier he attacked him first in his weakest point that was the baby for misery can never get such a hold of a baby as of a grown person diamond was knowing in babies and he knew he could do something to make the baby happy for although he had only known one baby as yet and although not one baby is the same as another yet they are so very much alike in some things and he knew that one baby so thoroughly that he had good reason to believe he could do something for any other i have known people who would have begun to fight the devil in a very different and a very stupid way they would have begun by scolding the idiotic cabman and next they would make his wife angry by saying it must be her fault as well as his and by leaving ill-bred though well-meant shabby little books for them to read which they were sure to hate the sight of while all the time they would not have put out a finger to touch the wailing baby but diamond had him out of the cradle in a moment set him up on his knee and told him to look at the light now all the light there was came only from a lamp in the yard and it was a very dingy and yellow light for the glass of the lamp was dirty and the gas was bad but the light that came from it was notwithstanding as certainly light as if it had come from the sun itself and the baby knew that and smiled to it and although it was indeed a wretched room which that lamp lighted so dreary and dirty and empty and hopeless there in the middle of it sat diamond on a stool smiling to the baby and the baby on his knees smiling to the lamp the father of him sat staring at nothing neither asleep nor awake not quite lost in stupidity either for through it all he was dimly angry with himself he did not know why it was that he had struck his wife he had forgotten it but was miserable about it notwithstanding and this misery was the voice of the great love that had made him and his wife and the baby and diamond speaking in his heart and telling him to be good for that great love speaks in the most wretched and dirty hearts only the tone of its voice depends on the echoes of the place in which it sounds on mount sinai it was thunder in the cabman's heart it was misery in the soul of st john it was perfect blessedness  by and by he became aware that there was a voice of singing in the room this of course was the voice of diamond singing to the baby song after song every one as foolish as another to the cabman for he was too tipsy to part one word from another  all the words mixed up in his ear in a gurgle without division or stop for such was the way he spoke himself when he was in this horrid condition but the baby was more than content with diamond's songs and diamond himself was so contented with what the songs were all about that he did not care a bit about the songs themselves if only baby liked them but they did the cabman good as well as the baby and diamond for they put him to sleep and the sleep was busy all the time it lasted smoothing the wrinkles out of his temper  at length diamond grew tired of singing and began to talk to the baby instead and as soon as he stopped singing the cabman began to wake up his brain was a little clearer now his temper a little smoother and his heart not quite so dirty he began to listen and he went on listening and heard diamond saying to the baby something like this for he thought the cabman was asleep   poor daddy baby's daddy takes too much beer and gin and that makes him somebody else and not his own self at all baby's daddy would never hit baby's mammy if he didn't take too much beer he's very fond of baby's mammy and works from morning to night to get her breakfast and dinner and supper only at night he forgets and pays the money away for beer and they put nasty stuff in beer i've heard my daddy say that drives all the good out and lets all the bad in daddy says when a man takes a drink there's a thirsty devil creeps into his inside because he knows he will always get enough there and the devil is always crying out for more drink and that makes the man thirsty and so he drinks more and more till he kills himself with it and then the ugly devil creeps out of him and crawls about on his belly looking for some other cabman to get into that he may drink drink drink that's what my daddy says baby and he says too the only way to make the devil come out is to give him plenty of cold water and tea and coffee and nothing at all that comes from the public-house for the devil can't abide that kind of stuff and creeps out pretty soon for fear of being drowned in it but your daddy will drink the nasty stuff poor man i wish he wouldn't for it makes mammy cross with him and no wonder and then when mammy's cross he's crosser and there's nobody in the house to take care of them but baby and you do take care of them baby don't you baby i know you do babies always take care of their fathers and mothers don't they baby that's what they come for isn't it baby and when daddy stops drinking beer and nasty gin with turpentine in it father says then mammy will be so happy and look so pretty and daddy will be so good to baby and baby will be as happy as a swallow which is the merriest fellow and diamond will be so happy too and when diamond's a man he'll take baby out with him on the box and teach him to drive a cab  he went on with chatter like this till baby was asleep by which time he was tired and father and mother were both wide awake only rather confused the one from the beer the other from the blow and staring the one from his chair the other from her bed at diamond but he was quite unaware of their notice for he sat half-asleep with his eyes wide open staring in his turn though without knowing it at the cabman while the cabman could not withdraw his gaze from diamond's white face and big eyes for diamond's face was always rather pale and now it was paler than usual with sleeplessness and the light of the street-lamp upon it at length he found himself nodding and he knew then it was time to put the baby down lest he should let him fall so he rose from the little three-legged stool and laid the baby in the cradle and covered him up it was well it was a warm night and he did not want much covering and then he all but staggered out of the door he was so tipsy himself with sleep  wife said the cabman turning towards the bed i do somehow believe that wur a angel just gone did you see him wife he warn't wery big and he hadn't got none o' them wingses you know it wur one o' them baby-angels you sees on the gravestones you know  nonsense hubby said his wife but it's just as good i might say better for you can ketch hold of him when you like that's little diamond as everybody knows and a duck o' diamonds he is no woman could wish for a better child than he be  i ha' heerd on him in the stable but i never see the brat afore come old girl let bygones be bygones and gie us a kiss and we'll go to bed  the cabman kept his cab in another yard although he had his room in this he was often late in coming home and was not one to take notice of children especially when he was tipsy which was oftener than not hence if he had ever seen diamond he did not know him but his wife knew him well enough as did every one else who lived all day in the yard she was a good-natured woman it was she who had got the fire lighted and the tea ready for them when diamond and his mother came home from sandwich and her husband was not an ill-natured man either and when in the morning he recalled not only diamond's visit but how he himself had behaved to his wife he was very vexed with himself and gladdened his poor wife's heart by telling her how sorry he was and for a whole week after he did not go near the public-house hard as it was to avoid it seeing a certain rich brewer had built one like a trap to catch souls and bodies in at almost every corner he had to pass on his way home indeed he was never quite so bad after that though it was some time before he began really to reform     chapter xix diamond's friends   one day when old diamond was standing with his nose in his bag between pall mall and cockspur street and his master was reading the newspaper on the box of his cab which was the last of a good many in the row little diamond got down for a run for his legs were getting cramped with sitting and first of all he strolled with his hands in his pockets up to the crossing where the girl and her broom were to be found in all weathers just as he was going to speak to her a tall gentleman stepped upon the crossing he was pleased to find it so clean for the streets were muddy and he had nice boots on so he put his hand in his pocket and gave the girl a penny but when she gave him a sweet smile in return and made him a pretty courtesy he looked at her again and said   where do you live my child  paradise row she answered next door to the adam and eve down the area  whom do you live with he asked  my wicked old grannie she replied  you shouldn't call your grannie wicked said the gentleman  but she is said the girl looking up confidently in his face if you don't believe me you can come and take a look at her  the words sounded rude but the girl's face looked so simple that the gentleman saw she did not mean to be rude and became still more interested in her  still you shouldn't say so he insisted  shouldn't i everybody calls her wicked old grannie even them that's as wicked as her you should hear her swear there's nothing like it in the row indeed i assure you sir there's ne'er a one of them can shut my grannie up once she begins and gets right a-going you must put her in a passion first you know it's no good till you do that she's so old now how she do make them laugh to be sure  although she called her wicked the child spoke so as plainly to indicate pride in her grannie's pre-eminence in swearing  the gentleman looked very grave to hear her for he was sorry that such a nice little girl should be in such bad keeping but he did not know what to say next and stood for a moment with his eyes on the ground when he lifted them he saw the face of diamond looking up in his  please sir said diamond her grannie's very cruel to her sometimes and shuts her out in the streets at night if she happens to be late  is this your brother asked the gentleman of the girl  no sir  how does he know your grandmother then he does not look like one of her sort  oh no sir he's a good boy quite  here she tapped her forehead with her finger in a significant manner  what do you mean by that asked the gentleman while diamond looked on smiling  the cabbies call him god's baby she whispered he's not right in the head you know a tile loose  still diamond though he heard every word and understood it too kept on smiling what could it matter what people called him so long as he did nothing he ought not to do and besides god's baby was surely the best of names  well my little man and what can you do asked the gentleman turning towards him just for the sake of saying something  drive a cab said diamond  good and what else he continued for accepting what the girl had said he regarded the still sweetness of diamond's face as a sign of silliness and wished to be kind to the poor little fellow  nurse a baby said diamond  well and what else  clean father's boots and make him a bit of toast for his tea  you're a useful little man said the gentleman what else can you do  not much that i know of said diamond i can't curry a horse except somebody puts me on his back so i don't count that  can you read  no but mother can and father can and they're going to teach me some day soon  well here's a penny for you  thank you sir  and when you have learned to read come to me and i'll give you sixpence and a book with fine pictures in it  please sir where am i to come asked diamond who was too much a man of the world not to know that he must have the gentleman's address before he could go and see him  you're no such silly thought he as he put his hand in his pocket and brought out a card there he said your father will be able to read that and tell you where to go  yes sir thank you sir said diamond and put the card in his pocket  the gentleman walked away but turning round a few paces off saw diamond give his penny to the girl and walking slower heard him say   i've got a father and mother and little brother and you've got nothing but a wicked old grannie you may have my penny  the girl put it beside the other in her pocket the only trustworthy article of dress she wore her grandmother always took care that she had a stout pocket  is she as cruel as ever asked diamond  much the same but i gets more coppers now than i used to and i can get summats to eat and take browns enough home besides to keep her from grumbling it's a good thing she's so blind though  why asked diamond  'cause if she was as sharp in the eyes as she used to be she would find out i never eats her broken wittles and then she'd know as i must get something somewheres  doesn't she watch you then  o' course she do don't she just but i make believe and drop it in my lap and then hitch it into my pocket  what would she do if she found you out  she never give me no more  but you don't want it  yes i do want it  what do you do with it then  give it to cripple jim  who's cripple jim  a boy in the row his mother broke his leg when he wur a kid so he's never come to much but he's a good boy is jim and i love jim dearly i always keeps off a penny for jim leastways as often as i can but there i must sweep again for them busses makes no end o' dirt  diamond diamond cried his father who was afraid he might get no good by talking to the girl and diamond obeyed and got up again upon the box he told his father about the gentleman and what he had promised him if he would learn to read and showed him the gentleman's card  why it's not many doors from the mews said his father giving him back the card take care of it my boy for it may lead to something god knows in these hard times a man wants as many friends as he's ever likely to get  haven't you got friends enough father asked diamond  well i have no right to complain but the more the better you know  just let me count said diamond  and he took his hands from his pockets and spreading out the fingers of his left hand began to count beginning at the thumb  there's mother first and then baby and then me next there's old diamond and the cab no i won't count the cab for it never looks at you and when diamond's out of the shafts it's nobody then there's the man that drinks next door and his wife and his baby  they're no friends of mine said his father  well they're friends of mine said diamond  his father laughed  much good they'll do you he said  how do you know they won't returned diamond  well go on said his father  then there's jack and mr stonecrop and deary me not to have mentioned mr coleman and mrs coleman and miss coleman and mrs crump and then there's the clergyman that spoke to me in the garden that day the tree was blown down  what's his name  i don't know his name  where does he live  i don't know  how can you count him then  he did talk to me and very kindlike too  his father laughed again  why child you're just counting everybody you know that don't make 'em friends  don't it i thought it did well but they shall be my friends i shall make 'em  how will you do that  they can't help themselves then if they would if i choose to be their friend you know they can't prevent me then there's that girl at the crossing  a fine set of friends you do have to be sure diamond  surely she's a friend anyhow father if it hadn't been for her you would never have got mrs coleman and miss coleman to carry home  his father was silent for he saw that diamond was right and was ashamed to find himself more ungrateful than he had thought  then there's the new gentleman diamond went on  if he do as he say interposed his father  and why shouldn't he i daresay sixpence ain't too much for him to spare but i don't quite understand father  is nobody your friend but the one that does something for you  no i won't say that my boy you would have to leave out baby then  oh no i shouldn't baby can laugh in your face and crow in your ears and make you feel so happy call you that nothing father  the father's heart was fairly touched now he made no answer to this last appeal and diamond ended off with saying   and there's the best of mine to come yet and that's you daddy except it be mother you know you're my friend daddy ain't you and i'm your friend ain't i  and god for us all said his father and then they were both silent for that was very solemn     chapter xx diamond learns to read   the question of the tall gentleman as to whether diamond could read or not set his father thinking it was high time he could and as soon as old diamond was suppered and bedded he began the task that very night but it was not much of a task to diamond for his father took for his lesson-book those very rhymes his mother had picked up on the sea-shore and as diamond was not beginning too soon he learned very fast indeed within a month he was able to spell out most of the verses for himself  but he had never come upon the poem he thought he had heard his mother read from it that day he had looked through and through the book several times after he knew the letters and a few words fancying he could tell the look of it but had always failed to find one more like it than another so he wisely gave up the search till he could really read then he resolved to begin at the beginning and read them all straight through this took him nearly a fortnight when he had almost reached the end he came upon the following verses which took his fancy much although they were certainly not very like those he was in search of   little boy blue              little boy blue lost his way in a wood                sing apples and cherries roses and honey             he said i would not go back if i could                it's all so jolly and funny              he sang this wood is all my own                apples and cherries roses and honey             so here i'll sit like a king on my throne                all so jolly and funny              a little snake crept out of the tree                apples and cherries roses and honey             lie down at my feet little snake said he                all so jolly and funny              a little bird sang in the tree overhead                apples and cherries roses and honey             come and sing your song on my finger instead                all so jolly and funny              the snake coiled up and the bird flew down             and sang him the song of birdie brown              little boy blue found it tiresome to sit             and he thought he had better walk on a bit              so up he got his way to take             and he said come along little bird and snake              and waves of snake o'er the damp leaves passed             and the snake went first and birdie brown last              by boy blue's head with flutter and dart             flew birdie brown with its song in its heart              he came where the apples grew red and sweet              tree drop me an apple down at my feet              he came where the cherries hung plump and red              come to my mouth sweet kisses he said              and the boughs bow down and the apples they dapple             the grass too many for him to grapple              and the cheeriest cherries with never a miss             fall to his mouth each a full-grown kiss              he met a little brook singing a song             he said little brook you are going wrong              you must follow me follow me follow i say             do as i tell you and come this way              and the song-singing sing-songing forest brook             leaped from its bed and after him took              followed him followed  and pale and wan             the dead leaves rustled as the water ran              and every bird high up on the bough             and every creature low down below              he called and the creatures obeyed the call             took their legs and their wings and followed him all              squirrels that carried their tails like a sack             each on his own little humpy brown back              householder snails and slugs all tails             and butterflies flutterbies ships all sails              and weasels and ousels and mice and larks             and owls and rere-mice and harkydarks              all went running and creeping and flowing             after the merry boy fluttering and going              the dappled fawns fawning the fallow-deer following             the swallows and flies flying and swallowing              cockchafers henchafers cockioli-birds             cockroaches henroaches cuckoos in herds              the spider forgot and followed him spinning             and lost all his thread from end to beginning              the gay wasp forgot his rings and his waist             he never had made such undignified haste              the dragon-flies melted to mist with their hurrying             the mole in his moleskins left his barrowing burrowing              the bees went buzzing so busy and beesy             and the midges in columns so upright and easy              but little boy blue was not content             calling for followers still as he went              blowing his horn and beating his drum             and crying aloud come all of you come              he said to the shadows come after me              and the shadows began to flicker and flee              and they flew through the wood all flattering and fluttering             over the dead leaves flickering and muttering              and he said to the wind come follow come follow             with whistle and pipe and rustle and hollo              and the wind wound round at his desire             as if he had been the gold cock on the spire              and the cock itself flew down from the church             and left the farmers all in the lurch              they run and they fly they creep and they come             everything everything all and some              the very trees they tugged at their roots             only their feet were too fast in their boots              after him leaning and straining and bending             as on through their boles he kept walking and wending              till out of the wood he burst on a lea             shouting and calling come after me              and then they rose up with a leafy hiss             and stood as if nothing had been amiss              little boy blue sat down on a stone             and the creatures came round him every one              and he said to the clouds i want you there              and down they sank through the thin blue air              and he said to the sunset far in the west             come here i want you i know best              and the sunset came and stood up on the wold             and burned and glowed in purple and gold              then little boy blue began to ponder              what's to be done with them all i wonder              then little boy blue he said quite low             what to do with you all i am sure i don't know              then the clouds clodded down till dismal it grew             the snake sneaked close round birdie brown flew              the brook sat up like a snake on its tail             and the wind came up with a what-will-you wail              and all the creatures sat and stared             the mole opened his very eyes and glared              and for rats and bats and the world and his wife             little boy blue was afraid of his life              then birdie brown began to sing             and what he sang was the very thing               you have brought us all hither little boy blue             pray what do you want us all to do              go away  go away said little boy blue             i'm sure i don't want you get away do              no no no no no yes and no no              sang birdie brown it mustn't be so              we cannot for nothing come here and away             give us some work or else we stay              oh dear and oh dear with sob and with sigh             said little boy blue and began to cry              but before he got far he thought of a thing             and up he stood and spoke like a king              why do you hustle and jostle and bother             off with you all  take me back to my mother              the sunset stood at the gates of the west             follow me follow me came from birdie brown's breast              i am going that way as fast as i can              said the brook as it sank and turned and ran              back to the woods fled the shadows like ghosts              if we stay we shall all be missed from our posts              said the wind with a voice that had changed its cheer             i was just going there when you brought me here              that's where i live said the sack-backed squirrel             and he turned his sack with a swing and a swirl              said the cock of the spire his father's churchwarden              said the brook running faster i run through his garden              said the mole two hundred worms there i caught 'em             last year and i'm going again next autumn              said they all if that's where you want us to steer for             what in earth or in water did you bring us here for              never you mind said little boy blue             that's what i tell you  if that you won't do              i'll get up at once and go home without you             i think i will i begin to doubt you              he rose and up rose the snake on its tail             and hissed three times half a hiss half a wail              little boy blue he tried to go past him             but wherever he turned sat the snake and faced him              if you don't get out of my way he said             i tell you snake i will break your head              the snake he neither would go nor come             so he hit him hard with the stick of his drum              the snake fell down as if he were dead             and little boy blue set his foot on his head              and all the creatures they marched before him             and marshalled him home with a high cockolorum              and birdie brown sang twirrrr twitter twirrrr twee              apples and cherries roses and honey             little boy blue has listened to me              all so jolly and funny     chapter xxi sal's nanny   diamond managed with many blunders to read this rhyme to his mother  isn't it nice mother he said  yes it's pretty she answered  i think it means something returned diamond  i'm sure i don't know what she said  i wonder if it's the same boy yes it must be the same little boy blue you know let me see how does that rhyme go  little boy blue come blow me your horn   yes of course it is for this one went `blowing his horn and beating his drum' he had a drum too              little boy blue come blow me your horn             the sheep's in the meadow the cow's in the corn  he had to keep them out you know but he wasn't minding his work it goes               where's the little boy that looks after the sheep             he's under the haystack fast asleep  there you see mother and then let me see               who'll go and wake him  no not i             for if i do he'll be sure to cry  so i suppose nobody did wake him he was a rather cross little boy i daresay when woke up and when he did wake of himself and saw the mischief the cow had done to the corn instead of running home to his mother he ran away into the wood and lost himself don't you think that's very likely mother  i shouldn't wonder she answered  so you see he was naughty for even when he lost himself he did not want to go home any of the creatures would have shown him the way if he had asked it all but the snake he followed the snake you know and he took him farther away i suppose it was a young one of the same serpent that tempted adam and eve father was telling us about it last sunday you remember  bless the child said his mother to herself and then added aloud finding that diamond did not go on well what next  i don't know mother i'm sure there's a great deal more but what it is i can't say i only know that he killed the snake i suppose that's what he had a drumstick for he couldn't do it with his horn  but surely you're not such a silly as to take it all for true diamond  i think it must be it looks true that killing of the snake looks true it's what i've got to do so often  his mother looked uneasy diamond smiled full in her face and added   when baby cries and won't be happy and when father and you talk about your troubles i mean  this did little to reassure his mother and lest my reader should have his qualms about it too i venture to remind him once more that diamond had been to the back of the north wind  finding she made no reply diamond went on   in a week or so i shall be able to go to the tall gentleman and tell him i can read and i'll ask him if he can help me to understand the rhyme  but before the week was out he had another reason for going to mr raymond  for three days on each of which at one time or other diamond's father was on the same stand near the national gallery the girl was not at her crossing and diamond got quite anxious about her fearing she must be ill on the fourth day not seeing her yet he said to his father who had that moment shut the door of his cab upon a fare   father i want to go and look after the girl she can't be well  all right said his father only take care of yourself diamond  so saying he climbed on his box and drove off  he had great confidence in his boy you see and would trust him anywhere but if he had known the kind of place in which the girl lived he would perhaps have thought twice before he allowed him to go alone diamond who did know something of it had not however any fear from talking to the girl he had a good notion of where about it was and he remembered the address well enough so by asking his way some twenty times mostly of policemen he came at length pretty near the place the last policeman he questioned looked down upon him from the summit of six feet two inches and replied with another question but kindly   what do you want there my small kid it ain't where you was bred i guess  no sir answered diamond i live in bloomsbury  that's a long way off said the policeman  yes it's a good distance answered diamond but i find my way about pretty well policemen are always kind to me  but what on earth do you want here  diamond told him plainly what he was about and of course the man believed him for nobody ever disbelieved diamond people might think he was mistaken but they never thought he was telling a story  it's an ugly place said the policeman  is it far off asked diamond  no it's next door almost but it's not safe  nobody hurts me said diamond  i must go with you i suppose  oh no please not said diamond they might think i was going to meddle with them and i ain't you know  well do as you please said the man and gave him full directions  diamond set off never suspecting that the policeman who was a kind-hearted man with children of his own was following him close and watching him round every corner as he went on all at once he thought he remembered the place and whether it really was so or only that he had laid up the policeman's instructions well in his mind he went straight for the cellar of old sal  he's a sharp little kid anyhow for as simple as he looks said the man to himself not a wrong turn does he take but old sal's a rum un for such a child to pay a morning visit to she's worse when she's sober than when she's half drunk i've seen her when she'd have torn him in pieces  happily then for diamond old sal had gone out to get some gin when he came to her door at the bottom of the area-stair and knocked he received no answer he laid his ear to the door and thought he heard a moaning within so he tried the door and found it was not locked it was a dreary place indeed and very dark for the window was below the level of the street and covered with mud while over the grating which kept people from falling into the area stood a chest of drawers placed there by a dealer in second-hand furniture which shut out almost all the light and the smell in the place was dreadful diamond stood still for a while for he could see next to nothing but he heard the moaning plainly enough now when he got used to the darkness he discovered his friend lying with closed eyes and a white suffering face on a heap of little better than rags in a corner of the den he went up to her and spoke but she made him no answer indeed she was not in the least aware of his presence and diamond saw that he could do nothing for her without help so taking a lump of barley-sugar from his pocket which he had bought for her as he came along and laying it beside her he left the place having already made up his mind to go and see the tall gentleman mr raymond and ask him to do something for sal's nanny as the girl was called  by the time he got up the area-steps three or four women who had seen him go down were standing together at the top waiting for him they wanted his clothes for their children but they did not follow him down lest sal should find them there the moment he appeared they laid their hands on him and all began talking at once for each wanted to get some advantage over her neighbours he told them quite quietly for he was not frightened that he had come to see what was the matter with nanny  what do you know about nanny said one of them fiercely wait till old sal comes home and you'll catch it for going prying into her house when she's out if you don't give me your jacket directly i'll go and fetch her  i can't give you my jacket said diamond it belongs to my father and mother you know it's not mine to give is it now you would not think it right to give away what wasn't yours would you now  give it away no that i wouldn't i'd keep it she said with a rough laugh but if the jacket ain't yours what right have you to keep it here cherry make haste it'll be one go apiece  they all began to tug at the jacket while diamond stooped and kept his arms bent to resist them before they had done him or the jacket any harm however suddenly they all scampered away and diamond looking in the opposite direction saw the tall policeman coming towards him  you had better have let me come with you little man he said looking down in diamond's face which was flushed with his resistance  you came just in the right time thank you returned diamond they've done me no harm  they would have if i hadn't been at hand though  yes but you were at hand you know so they couldn't  perhaps the answer was deeper in purport than either diamond or the policeman knew they walked away together diamond telling his new friend how ill poor nanny was and that he was going to let the tall gentleman know the policeman put him in the nearest way for bloomsbury and stepping out in good earnest diamond reached mr raymond's door in less than an hour when he asked if he was at home the servant in return asked what he wanted  i want to tell him something  but i can't go and trouble him with such a message as that  he told me to come to him that is when i could read and i can  how am i to know that  diamond stared with astonishment for one moment then answered   why i've just told you that's how you know it  but this man was made of coarser grain than the policeman and instead of seeing that diamond could not tell a lie he put his answer down as impudence and saying do you think i'm going to take your word for it shut the door in his face  diamond turned and sat down on the doorstep thinking with himself that the tall gentleman must either come in or come out and he was therefore in the best possible position for finding him he had not waited long before the door opened again but when he looked round it was only the servant once more  get away he said what are you doing on the doorstep  waiting for mr raymond answered diamond getting up  he's not at home  then i'll wait till he comes returned diamond sitting down again with a smile  what the man would have done next i do not know but a step sounded from the hall and when diamond looked round yet again there was the tall gentleman  who's this john he asked  i don't know sir an imperent little boy as will sit on the doorstep  please sir said diamond he told me you weren't at home and i sat down to wait for you  eh what said mr raymond john john this won't do is it a habit of yours to turn away my visitors there'll be some one else to turn away i'm afraid if i find any more of this kind of thing come in my little man i suppose you've come to claim your sixpence  no sir not that  what can't you read yet  yes i can now a little but i'll come for that next time i came to tell you about sal's nanny  who's sal's nanny  the girl at the crossing you talked to the same day  oh yes i remember what's the matter has she got run over  then diamond told him all  now mr raymond was one of the kindest men in london he sent at once to have the horse put to the brougham took diamond with him and drove to the children's hospital there he was well known to everybody for he was not only a large subscriber but he used to go and tell the children stories of an afternoon one of the doctors promised to go and find nanny and do what could be done have her brought to the hospital if possible  that same night they sent a litter for her and as she could be of no use to old sal until she was better she did not object to having her removed so she was soon lying in the fever ward for the first time in her life in a nice clean bed but she knew nothing of the whole affair she was too ill to know anything     chapter xxii mr raymond's riddle   mr raymond took diamond home with him stopping at the mews to tell his mother that he would send him back soon diamond ran in with the message himself and when he reappeared he had in his hand the torn and crumpled book which north wind had given him  ah i see said mr raymond  you are going to claim your sixpence now  i wasn't thinking of that so much as of another thing said diamond there's a rhyme in this book i can't quite understand i want you to tell me what it means if you please  i will if i can answered mr raymond you shall read it to me when we get home and then i shall see  still with a good many blunders diamond did read it after a fashion mr raymond took the little book and read it over again  now mr raymond was a poet himself and so although he had never been at the back of the north wind he was able to understand the poem pretty well but before saying anything about it he read it over aloud and diamond thought he understood it much better already  i'll tell you what i think it means he then said it means that people may have their way for a while if they like but it will get them into such troubles they'll wish they hadn't had it  i know i know said diamond like the poor cabman next door he drinks too much  just so returned mr raymond but when people want to do right things about them will try to help them only they must kill the snake you know  i was sure the snake had something to do with it cried diamond triumphantly  a good deal more talk followed and mr raymond gave diamond his sixpence  what will you do with it he asked  take it home to my mother he answered she has a teapot such a black one with a broken spout and she keeps all her money in it it ain't much but she saves it up to buy shoes for me and there's baby coming on famously and he'll want shoes soon and every sixpence is something ain't it sir  to be sure my man i hope you'll always make as good a use of your money  i hope so sir said diamond  and here's a book for you full of pictures and stories and poems i wrote it myself chiefly for the children of the hospital where i hope nanny is going i don't mean i printed it you know i made it added mr raymond wishing diamond to understand that he was the author of the book  i know what you mean i make songs myself they're awfully silly but they please baby and that's all they're meant for  couldn't you let me hear one of them now said mr raymond  no sir i couldn't i forget them as soon as i've done with them besides i couldn't make a line without baby on my knee we make them together you know they're just as much baby's as mine it's he that pulls them out of me  i suspect the child's a genius said the poet to himself and that's what makes people think him silly  now if any of my child readers want to know what a genius is shall i try to tell them or shall i not i will give them one very short answer  it means one who understands things without any other body telling him what they mean god makes a few such now and then to teach the rest of us  do you like riddles asked mr raymond turning over the leaves of his own book  i don't know what a riddle is said diamond  it's something that means something else and you've got to find out what the something else is  mr raymond liked the old-fashioned riddle best and had written a few one of which he now read              i have only one foot but thousands of toes             my one foot stands but never goes             i have many arms and they're mighty all             and hundreds of fingers large and small             from the ends of my fingers my beauty grows             i breathe with my hair and i drink with my toes             i grow bigger and bigger about the waist             and yet i am always very tight laced             none e'er saw me eat i've no mouth to bite             yet i eat all day in the full sunlight             in the summer with song i shave and quiver             but in winter i fast and groan and shiver   do you know what that means diamond he asked when he had finished  no indeed i don't answered diamond  then you can read it for yourself and think over it and see if you can find out said mr raymond giving him the book and now you had better go home to your mother when you've found the riddle you can come again  if diamond had had to find out the riddle in order to see mr raymond again i doubt if he would ever have seen him  oh then i think i hear some little reader say he could not have been a genius for a genius finds out things without being told  i answer genius finds out truths not tricks and if you do not understand that i am afraid you must be content to wait till you grow older and know more     chapter xxiii the early bird   when diamond got home he found his father at home already sitting by the fire and looking rather miserable for his head ached and he felt sick he had been doing night work of late and it had not agreed with him so he had given it up but not in time for he had taken some kind of fever the next day he was forced to keep his bed and his wife nursed him and diamond attended to the baby if he had not been ill it would have been delightful to have him at home and the first day diamond sang more songs than ever to the baby and his father listened with some pleasure but the next he could not bear even diamond's sweet voice and was very ill indeed so diamond took the baby into his own room and had no end of quiet games with him there if he did pull all his bedding on the floor it did not matter for he kept baby very quiet and made the bed himself again and slept in it with baby all the next night and many nights after  but long before his father got well his mother's savings were all but gone she did not say a word about it in the hearing of her husband lest she should distress him and one night when she could not help crying she came into diamond's room that his father might not hear her she thought diamond was asleep but he was not when he heard her sobbing he was frightened and said   is father worse mother  no diamond she answered as well as she could he's a good bit better  then what are you crying for mother  because my money is almost all gone she replied  o mammy you make me think of a little poem baby and i learned out of north wind's book to-day don't you remember how i bothered you about some of the words  yes child said his mother heedlessly thinking only of what she should do after to-morrow  diamond began and repeated the poem for he had a wonderful memory              a little bird sat on the edge of her nest                her yellow-beaks slept as sound as tops             that day she had done her very best                and had filled every one of their little crops             she had filled her own just over-full                and hence she was feeling a little dull              oh dear she sighed as she sat with her head                sunk in her chest and no neck at all             while her crop stuck out like a feather bed                turned inside out and rather small             what shall i do if things don't reform             i don't know where there's a single worm              i've had twenty to-day and the children five each                besides a few flies and some very fat spiders              no one will say i don't do as i preach                 i'm one of the best of bird-providers             but where's the use  we want a storm                 i don't know where there's a single worm              there's five in my crop said a wee wee bird                which woke at the voice of his mother's pain             i know where there's five and with the word                he tucked in his head and went off again             the folly of childhood sighed his mother             has always been my especial bother              the yellow-beaks they slept on and on                 they never had heard of the bogy to-morrow             but the mother sat outside making her moan                 she'll soon have to beg or steal or borrow             for she never can tell the night before             where she shall find one red worm more              the fact as i say was she'd had too many                she couldn't sleep and she called it virtue             motherly foresight affection any                name you may call it that will not hurt you             so it was late ere she tucked her head in             and she slept so late it was almost a sin              but the little fellow who knew of five                nor troubled his head about any more             woke very early felt quite alive                and wanted a sixth to add to his store              he pushed his mother the greedy elf             then thought he had better try for himself              when his mother awoke and had rubbed her eyes                feeling less like a bird and more like a mole             she saw him fancy with what surprise                 dragging a huge worm out of a hole             'twas of this same hero the proverb took form              'tis the early bird that catches the worm   there mother said diamond as he finished ain't it funny  i wish you were like that little bird diamond and could catch worms for yourself said his mother as she rose to go and look after her husband  diamond lay awake for a few minutes thinking what he could do to catch worms it was very little trouble to make up his mind however and still less to go to sleep after it     chapter xxiv another early bird   he got up in the morning as soon as he heard the men moving in the yard he tucked in his little brother so that he could not tumble out of bed and then went out leaving the door open so that if he should cry his mother might hear him at once when he got into the yard he found the stable-door just opened  i'm the early bird i think he said to himself i hope i shall catch the worm  he would not ask any one to help him fearing his project might meet with disapproval and opposition with great difficulty but with the help of a broken chair he brought down from his bedroom he managed to put the harness on diamond if the old horse had had the least objection to the proceeding of course he could not have done it but even when it came to the bridle he opened his mouth for the bit just as if he had been taking the apple which diamond sometimes gave him he fastened the cheek-strap very carefully just in the usual hole for fear of choking his friend or else letting the bit get amongst his teeth it was a job to get the saddle on but with the chair he managed it if old diamond had had an education in physics to equal that of the camel he would have knelt down to let him put it on his back but that was more than could be expected of him and then diamond had to creep quite under him to get hold of the girth the collar was almost the worst part of the business but there diamond could help diamond he held his head very low till his little master had got it over and turned it round and then he lifted his head and shook it on to his shoulders the yoke was rather difficult but when he had laid the traces over the horse's neck the weight was not too much for him he got him right at last and led him out of the stable  by this time there were several of the men watching him but they would not interfere they were so anxious to see how he would get over the various difficulties they followed him as far as the stable-door and there stood watching him again as he put the horse between the shafts got them up one after the other into the loops fastened the traces the belly-band the breeching and the reins  then he got his whip the moment he mounted the box the men broke into a hearty cheer of delight at his success but they would not let him go without a general inspection of the harness and although they found it right for not a buckle had to be shifted they never allowed him to do it for himself again all the time his father was ill  the cheer brought his mother to the window and there she saw her little boy setting out alone with the cab in the gray of morning she tugged at the window but it was stiff and before she could open it diamond who was in a great hurry was out of the mews and almost out of the street she called diamond diamond but there was no answer except from jack  never fear for him ma'am said jack it 'ud be only a devil as would hurt him and there ain't so many o' them as some folk 'ud have you believe a boy o' diamond's size as can 'arness a 'oss t'other diamond's size and put him to right as a trivet if he do upset the keb 'll fall on his feet ma'am  but he won't upset the cab will he jack  not he ma'am leastways he won't go for to do it  i know as much as that myself what do you mean  i mean he's a little likely to do it as the oldest man in the stable how's the gov'nor to-day ma'am  a good deal better thank you she answered closing the window in some fear lest her husband should have been made anxious by the news of diamond's expedition he knew pretty well however what his boy was capable of and although not quite easy was less anxious than his mother but as the evening drew on the anxiety of both of them increased and every sound of wheels made his father raise himself in his bed and his mother peep out of the window  diamond had resolved to go straight to the cab-stand where he was best known and never to crawl for fear of getting annoyed by idlers before he got across oxford street however he was hailed by a man who wanted to catch a train and was in too great a hurry to think about the driver having carried him to king's cross in good time and got a good fare in return he set off again in great spirits and reached the stand in safety he was the first there after all  as the men arrived they all greeted him kindly and inquired after his father  ain't you afraid of the old 'oss running away with you asked one  no he wouldn't run away with me answered diamond he knows i'm getting the shillings for father or if he did he would only run home  well you're a plucky one for all your girl's looks said the man and i wish ye luck  thank you sir said diamond i'll do what i can i came to the old place you see because i knew you would let me have my turn here  in the course of the day one man did try to cut him out but he was a stranger and the shout the rest of them raised let him see it would not do and made him so far ashamed besides that he went away crawling  once in a block a policeman came up to him and asked him for his number diamond showed him his father's badge saying with a smile   father's ill at home and so i came out with the cab there's no fear of me i can drive besides the old horse could go alone  just as well i daresay you're a pair of 'em but you are a rum 'un for a cabby ain't you now said the policeman i don't know as i ought to let you go  i ain't done nothing said diamond it's not my fault i'm no bigger i'm big enough for my age  that's where it is said the man you ain't fit  how do you know that asked diamond with his usual smile and turning his head like a little bird  why how are you to get out of this ruck now when it begins to move  just you get up on the box said diamond and i'll show you there that van's a-moving now jump up  the policeman did as diamond told him and was soon satisfied that the little fellow could drive  well he said as he got down again i don't know as i should be right to interfere good luck to you my little man  thank you sir said diamond and drove away  in a few minutes a gentleman hailed him  are you the driver of this cab he asked  yes sir said diamond showing his badge of which he was proud  you're the youngest cabman i ever saw how am i to know you won't break all my bones  i would rather break all my own said diamond but if you're afraid never mind me i shall soon get another fare  i'll risk it said the gentleman and opening the door himself he jumped in  he was going a good distance and soon found that diamond got him over the ground well now when diamond had only to go straight ahead and had not to mind so much what he was about his thoughts always turned to the riddle mr raymond had set him and this gentleman looked so clever that he fancied he must be able to read it for him he had given up all hope of finding it out for himself and he could not plague his father about it when he was ill he had thought of the answer himself but fancied it could not be the right one for to see how it all fitted required some knowledge of physiology so when he reached the end of his journey he got down very quickly and with his head just looking in at the window said as the gentleman gathered his gloves and newspapers   please sir can you tell me the meaning of a riddle  you must tell me the riddle first answered the gentleman amused  diamond repeated the riddle  oh that's easy enough he returned it's a tree  well it ain't got no mouth sure enough but how then does it eat all day long  it sucks in its food through the tiniest holes in its leaves he answered its breath is its food and it can't do it except in the daylight  thank you sir thank you returned diamond i'm sorry i couldn't find it out myself mr raymond would have been better pleased with me  but you needn't tell him any one told you  diamond gave him a stare which came from the very back of the north wind where that kind of thing is unknown  that would be cheating he said at last  ain't you a cabby then  cabbies don't cheat  don't they i am of a different opinion  i'm sure my father don't  what's your fare young innocent  well i think the distance is a good deal over three miles that's two shillings only father says sixpence a mile is too little though we can't ask for more  you're a deep one but i think you're wrong it's over four miles not much but it is  then that's half-a-crown said diamond  well here's three shillings will that do  thank you kindly sir i'll tell my father how good you were to me first to tell me my riddle then to put me right about the distance and then to give me sixpence over it'll help father to get well again it will  i hope it may my man i shouldn't wonder if you're as good as you look after all  as diamond returned he drew up at a stand he had never been on before  it was time to give diamond his bag of chopped beans and oats the men got about him and began to chaff him he took it all good-humouredly until one of them who was an ill-conditioned fellow began to tease old diamond by poking him roughly in the ribs and making general game of him that he could not bear and the tears came in his eyes he undid the nose-bag put it in the boot and was just going to mount and drive away when the fellow interfered and would not let him get up diamond endeavoured to persuade him and was very civil but he would have his fun out of him as he said in a few minutes a group of idle boys had assembled and diamond found himself in a very uncomfortable position another cab drew up at the stand and the driver got off and approached the assemblage  what's up here he asked and diamond knew the voice it was that of the drunken cabman  do you see this young oyster he pretends to drive a cab said his enemy  yes i do see him and i sees you too you'd better leave him alone he ain't no oyster he's a angel come down on his own business you be off or i'll be nearer you than quite agreeable  the drunken cabman was a tall stout man who did not look one to take liberties with  oh if he's a friend of yours said the other drawing back  diamond got out the nose-bag again old diamond should have his feed out now  yes he is a friend o' mine one o' the best i ever had it's a pity he ain't a friend o' yourn you'd be the better for it but it ain't no fault of hisn  when diamond went home at night he carried with him one pound one shilling and sixpence besides a few coppers extra which had followed some of the fares  his mother had got very anxious indeed so much so that she was almost afraid when she did hear the sound of his cab to go and look lest she should be yet again disappointed and should break down before her husband but there was the old horse and there was the cab all right and there was diamond in the box his pale face looking triumphant as a full moon in the twilight  when he drew up at the stable-door jack came out and after a good many friendly questions and congratulations said   you go in to your mother diamond i'll put up the old 'oss i'll take care on him he do deserve some small attention he do  thank you jack said diamond and bounded into the house and into the arms of his mother who was waiting him at the top of the stair  the poor anxious woman led him into his own room sat down on his bed took him on her lap as if he had been a baby and cried  how's father asked diamond almost afraid to ask  better my child she answered but uneasy about you my dear  didn't you tell him i was the early bird gone out to catch the worm  that was what put it in your head was it you monkey said his mother beginning to get better  that or something else answered diamond so very quietly that his mother held his head back and stared in his face  well of all the children she said and said no more  and here's my worm resumed diamond  but to see her face as he poured the shillings and sixpences and pence into her lap she burst out crying a second time and ran with the money to her husband  and how pleased he was it did him no end of good but while he was counting the coins diamond turned to baby who was lying awake in his cradle sucking his precious thumb and took him up saying   baby baby i haven't seen you for a whole year  and then he began to sing to him as usual and what he sang was this for he was too happy either to make a song of his own or to sing sense it was one out of mr raymond's book   the true story of the cat and the fiddle                 hey diddle diddle                the cat and the fiddle             he played such a merry tune                that the cow went mad                with the pleasure she had             and jumped right over the moon                but then don't you see                before that could be             the moon had come down and listened                the little dog hearkened                so loud that he barkened             there's nothing like it there isn't                 hey diddle diddle                went the cat and the fiddle             hey diddle diddle dee dee                the dog laughed at the sport                till his cough cut him short             it was hey diddle diddle oh me                and back came the cow                with a merry merry low             for she'd humbled the man in the moon                the dish got excited                the spoon was delighted             and the dish waltzed away with the spoon                 but the man in the moon                coming back too soon             from the famous town of norwich                caught up the dish                said it's just what i wish             to hold my cold plum-porridge                 gave the cow a rat-tat                flung water on the cat             and sent him away like a rocket                said o moon there you are                 got into her car             and went off with the spoon in his pocket                 hey ho  diddle diddle                the wet cat and wet fiddle             they made such a caterwauling                that the cow in a fright                stood bolt upright             bellowing now and bawling                and the dog on his tail                stretched his neck with a wail             but ho ho said the man in the moon                 no more in the south                shall i burn my mouth             for i've found a dish and a spoon     chapter xxv diamond's dream   there baby said diamond i'm so happy that i can only sing nonsense oh father think if you had been a poor man and hadn't had a cab and old diamond what should i have done  i don't know indeed what you could have done said his father from the bed  we should have all starved my precious diamond said his mother whose pride in her boy was even greater than her joy in the shillings both of them together made her heart ache for pleasure can do that as well as pain  oh no we shouldn't said diamond i could have taken nanny's crossing till she came back and then the money instead of going for old sal's gin would have gone for father's beef-tea i wonder what nanny will do when she gets well again somebody else will be sure to have taken the crossing by that time i wonder if she will fight for it and whether i shall have to help her i won't bother my head about that time enough yet hey diddle hey diddle hey diddle diddle i wonder whether mr raymond would take me to see nanny hey diddle hey diddle hey diddle diddle the baby and fiddle o mother i'm such a silly but i can't help it i wish i could think of something else but there's nothing will come into my head but hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle i wonder what the angels do when they're extra happy you know when they've been driving cabs all day and taking home the money to their mothers do you think they ever sing nonsense mother  i daresay they've got their own sort of it answered his mother else they wouldn't be like other people she was thinking more of her twenty-one shillings and sixpence and of the nice dinner she would get for her sick husband next day than of the angels and their nonsense when she said it but diamond found her answer all right  yes to be sure he replied they wouldn't be like other people if they hadn't their nonsense sometimes but it must be very pretty nonsense and not like that silly hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle i wish i could get it out of my head i wonder what the angels' nonsense is like nonsense is a very good thing ain't it mother a little of it now and then more of it for baby and not so much for grown people like cabmen and their mothers it's like the pepper and salt that goes in the soup that's it isn't it mother there's baby fast asleep oh what a nonsense baby it is to sleep so much shall i put him down mother  diamond chattered away what rose in his happy little heart ran out of his mouth and did his father and mother good when he went to bed which he did early being more tired as you may suppose than usual he was still thinking what the nonsense could be like which the angels sang when they were too happy to sing sense but before coming to any conclusion he fell fast asleep and no wonder for it must be acknowledged a difficult question  that night he had a very curious dream which i think my readers would like to have told them they would at least if they are as fond of nice dreams as i am and don't have enough of them of their own  he dreamed that he was running about in the twilight in the old garden he thought he was waiting for north wind but she did not come so he would run down to the back gate and see if she were there he ran and ran it was a good long garden out of his dream but in his dream it had grown so long and spread out so wide that the gate he wanted was nowhere he ran and ran but instead of coming to the gate found himself in a beautiful country not like any country he had ever been in before there were no trees of any size nothing bigger in fact than hawthorns which were full of may-blossom the place in which they grew was wild and dry mostly covered with grass but having patches of heath it extended on every side as far as he could see but although it was so wild yet wherever in an ordinary heath you might have expected furze bushes or holly or broom there grew roses wild and rare all kinds on every side far and near roses were glowing there too was the gum-cistus whose flowers fall every night and come again the next morning lilacs and syringas and laburnums and many shrubs besides of which he did not know the names but the roses were everywhere he wandered on and on wondering when it would come to an end it was of no use going back for there was no house to be seen anywhere but he was not frightened for you know diamond was used to things that were rather out of the way he threw himself down under a rose-bush and fell asleep  he woke not out of his dream but into it thinking he heard a child's voice calling diamond diamond he jumped up but all was still about him the rose-bushes were pouring out their odours in clouds he could see the scent like mists of the same colour as the rose issuing like a slow fountain and spreading in the air till it joined the thin rosy vapour which hung over all the wilderness but again came the voice calling him and it seemed to come from over his head he looked up but saw only the deep blue sky full of stars more brilliant however than he had seen them before and both sky and stars looked nearer to the earth  while he gazed up again he heard the cry at the same moment he saw one of the biggest stars over his head give a kind of twinkle and jump as if it went out and came in again he threw himself on his back and fixed his eyes upon it nor had he gazed long before it went out leaving something like a scar in the blue but as he went on gazing he saw a face where the star had been a merry face with bright eyes the eyes appeared not only to see diamond but to know that diamond had caught sight of them for the face withdrew the same moment again came the voice calling diamond diamond and in jumped the star to its place  diamond called as loud as he could right up into the sky   here's diamond down below you what do you want him to do  the next instant many of the stars round about that one went out and many voices shouted from the sky   come up come up we're so jolly diamond diamond  this was followed by a peal of the merriest kindliest laughter and all the stars jumped into their places again  how am i to come up shouted diamond  go round the rose-bush it's got its foot in it said the first voice  diamond got up at once and walked to the other side of the rose-bush  there he found what seemed the very opposite of what he wanted a stair down into the earth it was of turf and moss it did not seem to promise well for getting into the sky but diamond had learned to look through the look of things the voice must have meant that he was to go down this stair and down this stair diamond went without waiting to think more about it  it was such a nice stair so cool and soft all the sides as well as the steps grown with moss and grass and ferns down and down diamond went a long way until at last he heard the gurgling and splashing of a little stream nor had he gone much farther before he met it yes met it coming up the stairs to meet him running up just as naturally as if it had been doing the other thing neither was diamond in the least surprised to see it pitching itself from one step to another as it climbed towards him  he never thought it was odd and no more it was there it would have been odd here it made a merry tune as it came and its voice was like the laughter he had heard from the sky this appeared promising and he went on down and down the stair and up and up the stream till at last he came where it hurried out from under a stone and the stair stopped altogether and as the stream bubbled up the stone shook and swayed with its force and diamond thought he would try to lift it lightly it rose to his hand forced up by the stream from below and by what would have seemed an unaccountable perversion of things had he been awake threatened to come tumbling upon his head but he avoided it and when it fell got upon it he now saw that the opening through which the water came pouring in was over his head and with the help of the stone he scrambled out by it and found himself on the side of a grassy hill which rounded away from him in every direction and down which came the brook which vanished in the hole but scarcely had he noticed so much as this before a merry shouting and laughter burst upon him and a number of naked little boys came running every one eager to get to him first at the shoulders of each fluttered two little wings which were of no use for flying as they were mere buds only being made for it they could not help fluttering as if they were flying just as the foremost of the troop reached him one or two of them fell and the rest with shouts of laughter came tumbling over them till they heaped up a mound of struggling merriment one after another they extricated themselves and each as he got free threw his arms round diamond and kissed him diamond's heart was ready to melt within him from clear delight when they had all embraced him   now let us have some fun cried one and with a shout they all scampered hither and thither and played the wildest gambols on the grassy slopes they kept constantly coming back to diamond however as the centre of their enjoyment rejoicing over him as if they had found a lost playmate  there was a wind on the hillside which blew like the very embodiment of living gladness it blew into diamond's heart and made him so happy that he was forced to sit down and cry  now let's go and dig for stars said one who seemed to be the captain of the troop  they all scurried away but soon returned one after another each with a pickaxe on his shoulder and a spade in his hand as soon as they were gathered the captain led them in a straight line to another part of the hill diamond rose and followed  here is where we begin our lesson for to-night he said scatter and dig  there was no more fun each went by himself walking slowly with bent shoulders and his eyes fixed on the ground every now and then one would stop kneel down and look intently feeling with his hands and parting the grass one would get up and walk on again another spring to his feet catch eagerly at his pickaxe and strike it into the ground once and again then throw it aside snatch up his spade and commence digging at the loosened earth now one would sorrowfully shovel the earth into the hole again trample it down with his little bare white feet and walk on but another would give a joyful shout and after much tugging and loosening would draw from the hole a lump as big as his head or no bigger than his fist when the under side of it would pour such a blaze of golden or bluish light into diamond's eyes that he was quite dazzled gold and blue were the commoner colours  the jubilation was greater over red or green or purple and every time a star was dug up all the little angels dropped their tools and crowded about it shouting and dancing and fluttering their wing-buds  when they had examined it well they would kneel down one after the other and peep through the hole but they always stood back to give diamond the first look all that diamond could report however was that through the star-holes he saw a great many things and places and people he knew quite well only somehow they were different there was something marvellous about them he could not tell what every time he rose from looking through a star-hole he felt as if his heart would break for joy and he said that if he had not cried he did not know what would have become of him  as soon as all had looked the star was carefully fitted in again a little mould was strewn over it and the rest of the heap left as a sign that the star had been discovered  at length one dug up a small star of a most lovely colour a colour diamond had never seen before the moment the angel saw what it was instead of showing it about he handed it to one of his neighbours and seated himself on the edge of the hole saying   this will do for me good-bye i'm off  they crowded about him hugging and kissing him then stood back with a solemn stillness their wings lying close to their shoulders the little fellow looked round on them once with a smile and then shot himself headlong through the star-hole diamond as privileged threw himself on the ground to peep after him but he saw nothing it's no use said the captain i never saw anything more of one that went that way  his wings can't be much use said diamond concerned and fearful yet comforted by the calm looks of the rest  that's true said the captain he's lost them by this time they all do that go that way you haven't got any you see  no said diamond i never did have any  oh didn't you said the captain  some people say he added after a pause that they come again i don't know i've never found the colour i care about myself i suppose i shall some day  then they looked again at the star put it carefully into its hole danced around it and over it but solemnly and called it by the name of the finder  will you know it again asked diamond  oh yes we never forget a star that's been made a door of  then they went on with their searching and digging  diamond having neither pickaxe nor spade had the more time to think  i don't see any little girls he said at last  the captain stopped his shovelling leaned on his spade rubbed his forehead thoughtfully with his left hand the little angels were all left-handed repeated the words little girls and then as if a thought had struck him resumed his work saying   i think i know what you mean i've never seen any of them of course but i suppose that's the sort you mean i'm told but mind i don't say it is so for i don't know that when we fall asleep a troop of angels very like ourselves only quite different goes round to all the stars we have discovered and discovers them after us i suppose with our shovelling and handling we spoil them a bit and i daresay the clouds that come up from below make them smoky and dull sometimes they say mind i say they say these other angels take them out one by one and pass each round as we do and breathe over it and rub it with their white hands which are softer than ours because they don't do any pick-and-spade work and smile at it and put it in again  and that is what keeps them from growing dark  how jolly thought diamond i should like to see them at their work too when do you go to sleep he asked the captain  when we grow sleepy answered the captain they do say but mind i say they say that it is when those others what do you call them i don't know if that is their name i am only guessing that may be the sort you mean when they are on their rounds and come near any troop of us we fall asleep they live on the west side of the hill none of us have ever been to the top of it yet  even as he spoke he dropped his spade he tumbled down beside it and lay fast asleep one after the other each of the troop dropped his pickaxe or shovel from his listless hands and lay fast asleep by his work  ah thought diamond to himself with delight now the girl-angels are coming and i not being an angel shall not fall asleep like the rest and i shall see the girl-angels  but the same moment he felt himself growing sleepy he struggled hard with the invading power he put up his fingers to his eyelids and pulled them open but it was of no use he thought he saw a glimmer of pale rosy light far up the green hill and ceased to know  when he awoke all the angels were starting up wide awake too he expected to see them lift their tools but no the time for play had come they looked happier than ever and each began to sing where he stood he had not heard them sing before  now he thought i shall know what kind of nonsense the angels sing when they are merry they don't drive cabs i see but they dig for stars and they work hard enough to be merry after it  and he did hear some of the angels' nonsense for if it was all sense to them it had only just as much sense to diamond as made good nonsense of it he tried hard to set it down in his mind listening as closely as he could now to one now to another and now to all together but while they were yet singing he began to his dismay to find that he was coming awake faster and faster and as he came awake he found that for all the goodness of his memory verse after verse of the angels' nonsense vanished from it he always thought he could keep the last but as the next began he lost the one before it and at length awoke struggling to keep hold of the last verse of all he felt as if the effort to keep from forgetting that one verse of the vanishing song nearly killed him and yet by the time he was wide awake he could not be sure of that even it was something like this             white hands of whiteness            wash the stars' faces          till glitter glitter glit goes their brightness            down to poor places   this however was so near sense that he thought it could not be really what they did sing     chapter xxvi diamond takes a fare the wrong way right   the next morning diamond was up almost as early as before he had nothing to fear from his mother now and made no secret of what he was about by the time he reached the stable several of the men were there they asked him a good many questions as to his luck the day before and he told them all they wanted to know but when he proceeded to harness the old horse they pushed him aside with rough kindness called him a baby and began to do it all for him so diamond ran in and had another mouthful of tea and bread and butter and although he had never been so tired as he was the night before he started quite fresh this morning it was a cloudy day and the wind blew hard from the north so hard sometimes that perched on the box with just his toes touching the ground diamond wished that he had some kind of strap to fasten himself down with lest he should be blown away but he did not really mind it  his head was full of the dream he had dreamed but it did not make him neglect his work for his work was not to dig stars but to drive old diamond and pick up fares there are not many people who can think about beautiful things and do common work at the same time but then there are not many people who have been to the back of the north wind  there was not much business doing and diamond felt rather cold notwithstanding his mother had herself put on his comforter and helped him with his greatcoat but he was too well aware of his dignity to get inside his cab as some do a cabman ought to be above minding the weather at least so diamond thought at length he was called to a neighbouring house where a young woman with a heavy box had to be taken to wapping for a coast-steamer  he did not find it at all pleasant so far east and so near the river for the roughs were in great force however there being no block not even in nightingale lane he reached the entrance of the wharf and set down his passenger without annoyance but as he turned to go back some idlers not content with chaffing him showed a mind to the fare the young woman had given him they were just pulling him off the box and diamond was shouting for the police when a pale-faced man in very shabby clothes but with the look of a gentleman somewhere about him came up and making good use of his stick drove them off  now my little man he said get on while you can don't lose any time this is not a place for you  but diamond was not in the habit of thinking only of himself he saw that his new friend looked weary if not ill and very poor  won't you jump in sir he said i will take you wherever you like  thank you my man but i have no money so i can't  oh i don't want any money i shall be much happier if you will get in you have saved me all i had i owe you a lift sir  which way are you going  to charing cross but i don't mind where i go  well i am very tired if you will take me to charing cross i shall be greatly obliged to you i have walked from gravesend and had hardly a penny left to get through the tunnel  so saying he opened the door and got in and diamond drove away  but as he drove he could not help fancying he had seen the gentleman for diamond knew he was a gentleman before do all he could however he could not recall where or when meantime his fare if we may call him such seeing he was to pay nothing whom the relief of being carried had made less and less inclined to carry himself had been turning over things in his mind and as they passed the mint called to diamond who stopped the horse got down and went to the window  if you didn't mind taking me to chiswick i should be able to pay you when we got there it's a long way but you shall have the whole fare from the docks and something over  very well sir said diamond i shall be most happy  he was just clambering up again when the gentleman put his head out of the window and said   it's the wilderness mr coleman's place but i'll direct you when we come into the neighbourhood  it flashed upon diamond who he was but he got upon his box to arrange his thoughts before making any reply  the gentleman was mr evans to whom miss coleman was to have been married and diamond had seen him several times with her in the garden i have said that he had not behaved very well to miss coleman he had put off their marriage more than once in a cowardly fashion merely because he was ashamed to marry upon a small income and live in a humble way when a man thinks of what people will say in such a case he may love but his love is but a poor affair mr coleman took him into the firm as a junior partner and it was in a measure through his influence that he entered upon those speculations which ruined him so his love had not been a blessing the ship which north wind had sunk was their last venture and mr evans had gone out with it in the hope of turning its cargo to the best advantage he was one of the single boat-load which managed to reach a desert island and he had gone through a great many hardships and sufferings since then but he was not past being taught and his troubles had done him no end of good for they had made him doubt himself and begin to think so that he had come to see that he had been foolish as well as wicked for if he had had miss coleman with him in the desert island to build her a hut and hunt for her food and make clothes for her he would have thought himself the most fortunate of men and when he was at home he would not marry till he could afford a man-servant before he got home again he had even begun to understand that no man can make haste to be rich without going against the will of god in which case it is the one frightful thing to be successful so he had come back a more humble man and longing to ask miss coleman to forgive him but he had no idea what ruin had fallen upon them for he had never made himself thoroughly acquainted with the firm's affairs few speculative people do know their own affairs hence he never doubted he should find matters much as he left them and expected to see them all at the wilderness as before but if he had not fallen in with diamond he would not have thought of going there first  what was diamond to do he had heard his father and mother drop some remarks concerning mr evans which made him doubtful of him he understood that he had not been so considerate as he might have been so he went rather slowly till he should make up his mind it was of course of no use to drive mr evans to chiswick but if he should tell him what had befallen them and where they lived now he might put off going to see them and he was certain that miss coleman at least must want very much to see mr evans he was pretty sure also that the best thing in any case was to bring them together and let them set matters right for themselves  the moment he came to this conclusion he changed his course from westward to northward and went straight for mr coleman's poor little house in hoxton mr evans was too tired and too much occupied with his thoughts to take the least notice of the streets they passed through and had no suspicion therefore of the change of direction  by this time the wind had increased almost to a hurricane and as they had often to head it it was no joke for either of the diamonds the distance however was not great before they reached the street where mr coleman lived it blew so tremendously that when miss coleman who was going out a little way opened the door it dashed against the wall with such a bang that she was afraid to venture and went in again in five minutes after diamond drew up at the door as soon as he had entered the street however the wind blew right behind them and when he pulled up old diamond had so much ado to stop the cab against it that the breeching broke young diamond jumped off his box knocked loudly at the door then turned to the cab and said before mr evans had quite begun to think something must be amiss   please sir my harness has given away would you mind stepping in here for a few minutes they're friends of mine i'll take you where you like after i've got it mended i shan't be many minutes but you can't stand in this wind  half stupid with fatigue and want of food mr evans yielded to the boy's suggestion and walked in at the door which the maid held with difficulty against the wind she took mr evans for a visitor as indeed he was and showed him into the room on the ground-floor diamond who had followed into the hall whispered to her as she closed the door   tell miss coleman it's miss coleman he wants to see  i don't know said the maid he don't look much like a gentleman  he is though and i know him and so does miss coleman  the maid could not but remember diamond having seen him when he and his father brought the ladies home so she believed him and went to do what he told her  what passed in the little parlour when miss coleman came down does not belong to my story which is all about diamond if he had known that miss coleman thought mr evans was dead perhaps he would have managed differently there was a cry and a running to and fro in the house and then all was quiet again  almost as soon as mr evans went in the wind began to cease and was now still diamond found that by making the breeching just a little tighter than was quite comfortable for the old horse he could do very well for the present and thinking it better to let him have his bag in this quiet place he sat on the box till the old horse should have eaten his dinner in a little while mr evans came out and asked him to come in diamond obeyed and to his delight miss coleman put her arms round him and kissed him and there was payment for him not to mention the five precious shillings she gave him which he could not refuse because his mother wanted them so much at home for his father he left them nearly as happy as they were themselves  the rest of the day he did better and although he had not so much to take home as the day before yet on the whole the result was satisfactory and what a story he had to tell his father and mother about his adventures and how he had done and what was the result they asked him such a multitude of questions some of which he could answer and some of which he could not answer and his father seemed ever so much better from finding that his boy was already not only useful to his family but useful to other people and quite taking his place as a man who judged what was wise and did work worth doing  for a fortnight diamond went on driving his cab and keeping his family he had begun to be known about some parts of london and people would prefer taking his cab because they liked what they heard of him one gentleman who lived near the mews engaged him to carry him to the city every morning at a certain hour and diamond was punctual as clockwork though to effect that required a good deal of care for his father's watch was not much to be depended on and had to be watched itself by the clock of st george's church between the two however he did make a success of it  after that fortnight his father was able to go out again then diamond went to make inquiries about nanny and this led to something else     chapter xxvii the children's hospital   the first day his father resumed his work diamond went with him as usual in the afternoon however his father having taken a fare to the neighbourhood went home and diamond drove the cab the rest of the day it was hard for old diamond to do all the work but they could not afford to have another horse they contrived to save him as much as possible and fed him well and he did bravely  the next morning his father was so much stronger that diamond thought he might go and ask mr raymond to take him to see nanny he found him at home his servant had grown friendly by this time and showed him in without any cross-questioning mr raymond received him with his usual kindness consented at once and walked with him to the hospital which was close at hand it was a comfortable old-fashioned house built in the reign of queen anne and in her day no doubt inhabited by rich and fashionable people  now it was a home for poor sick children who were carefully tended for love's sake there are regions in london where a hospital in every other street might be full of such children whose fathers and mothers are dead or unable to take care of them  when diamond followed mr raymond into the room where those children who had got over the worst of their illness and were growing better lay he saw a number of little iron bedsteads with their heads to the walls and in every one of them a child whose face was a story in itself in some health had begun to appear in a tinge upon the cheeks and a doubtful brightness in the eyes just as out of the cold dreary winter the spring comes in blushing buds and bright crocuses in others there were more of the signs of winter left their faces reminded you of snow and keen cutting winds more than of sunshine and soft breezes and butterflies but even in them the signs of suffering told that the suffering was less and that if the spring-time had but arrived it had yet arrived  diamond looked all round but could see no nanny he turned to mr raymond with a question in his eyes  well said mr raymond  nanny's not here said diamond  oh yes she is  i don't see her  i do though there she is  he pointed to a bed right in front of where diamond was standing  that's not nanny he said  it is nanny i have seen her many times since you have illness makes a great difference  why that girl must have been to the back of the north wind thought diamond but he said nothing only stared and as he stared something of the old nanny began to dawn through the face of the new nanny the old nanny though a good girl and a friendly girl had been rough blunt in her speech and dirty in her person her face would always have reminded one who had already been to the back of the north wind of something he had seen in the best of company but it had been coarse notwithstanding partly from the weather partly from her living amongst low people and partly from having to defend herself  now it was so sweet and gentle and refined that she might have had a lady and gentleman for a father and mother and diamond could not help thinking of words which he had heard in the church the day before  surely it is good to be afflicted or something like that north wind somehow or other must have had to do with her she had grown from a rough girl into a gentle maiden  mr raymond however was not surprised for he was used to see such lovely changes something like the change which passes upon the crawling many-footed creature when it turns sick and ill and revives a butterfly with two wings instead of many feet instead of her having to take care of herself kind hands ministered to her making her comfortable and sweet and clean soothing her aching head and giving her cooling drink when she was thirsty and kind eyes the stars of the kingdom of heaven had shone upon her so that what with the fire of the fever and the dew of tenderness that which was coarse in her had melted away and her whole face had grown so refined and sweet that diamond did not know her but as he gazed the best of the old face all the true and good part of it that which was nanny herself dawned upon him like the moon coming out of a cloud until at length instead of only believing mr raymond that this was she he saw for himself that it was nanny indeed very worn but grown beautiful  he went up to her she smiled he had heard her laugh but had never seen her smile before  nanny do you know me said diamond  she only smiled again as if the question was amusing  she was not likely to forget him for although she did not yet know it was he who had got her there she had dreamed of him often and had talked much about him when delirious nor was it much wonder for he was the only boy except joe who had ever shown her kindness  meantime mr raymond was going from bed to bed talking to the little people every one knew him and every one was eager to have a look and a smile and a kind word from him  diamond sat down on a stool at the head of nanny's bed she laid her hand in his no one else of her old acquaintance had been near her  suddenly a little voice called aloud   won't mr raymond tell us a story  oh yes please do please do cried several little voices which also were stronger than the rest for mr raymond was in the habit of telling them a story when he went to see them and they enjoyed it far more than the other nice things which the doctor permitted him to give them  very well said mr raymond i will what sort of a story shall it be  a true story said one little girl  a fairy tale said a little boy  well said mr raymond i suppose as there is a difference i may choose i can't think of any true story just at this moment so i will tell you a sort of a fairy one  oh jolly exclaimed the little boy who had called out for a fairy tale  it came into my head this morning as i got out of bed continued mr raymond and if it turns out pretty well i will write it down and get somebody to print it for me and then you shall read it when you like  then nobody ever heard it before asked one older child  no nobody  oh exclaimed several thinking it very grand to have the first telling and i daresay there might be a peculiar freshness about it because everything would be nearly as new to the story-teller himself as to the listeners  some were only sitting up and some were lying down so there could not be the same busy gathering bustling and shifting to and fro with which children generally prepare themselves to hear a story but their faces and the turning of their heads and many feeble exclamations of expected pleasure showed that all such preparations were making within them  mr raymond stood in the middle of the room that he might turn from side to side and give each a share of seeing him diamond kept his place by nanny's side with her hand in his i do not know how much of mr raymond's story the smaller children understood indeed i don't quite know how much there was in it to be understood for in such a story every one has just to take what he can get but they all listened with apparent satisfaction and certainly with great attention mr raymond wrote it down afterwards and here it is somewhat altered no doubt for a good story-teller tries to make his stories better every time he tells them i cannot myself help thinking that he was somewhat indebted for this one to the old story of the sleeping beauty     chapter xxviii little daylight   no house of any pretension to be called a palace is in the least worthy of the name except it has a wood near it very near it and the nearer the better not all round it i don't mean that for a palace ought to be open to the sun and wind and stand high and brave with weathercocks glittering and flags flying but on one side of every palace there must be a wood and there was a very grand wood indeed beside the palace of the king who was going to be daylight's father such a grand wood that nobody yet had ever got to the other end of it near the house it was kept very trim and nice and it was free of brushwood for a long way in but by degrees it got wild and it grew wilder and wilder and wilder until some said wild beasts at last did what they liked in it the king and his courtiers often hunted however and this kept the wild beasts far away from the palace  one glorious summer morning when the wind and sun were out together when the vanes were flashing and the flags frolicking against the blue sky little daylight made her appearance from somewhere nobody could tell where a beautiful baby with such bright eyes that she might have come from the sun only by and by she showed such lively ways that she might equally well have come out of the wind there was great jubilation in the palace for this was the first baby the queen had had and there is as much happiness over a new baby in a palace as in a cottage  but there is one disadvantage of living near a wood  you do not know quite who your neighbours may be everybody knew there were in it several fairies living within a few miles of the palace who always had had something to do with each new baby that came for fairies live so much longer than we that they can have business with a good many generations of human mortals the curious houses they lived in were well known also one a hollow oak another a birch-tree though nobody could ever find how that fairy made a house of it another a hut of growing trees intertwined and patched up with turf and moss but there was another fairy who had lately come to the place and nobody even knew she was a fairy except the other fairies a wicked old thing she was always concealing her power and being as disagreeable as she could in order to tempt people to give her offence that she might have the pleasure of taking vengeance upon them the people about thought she was a witch and those who knew her by sight were careful to avoid offending her she lived in a mud house in a swampy part of the forest  in all history we find that fairies give their remarkable gifts to prince or princess or any child of sufficient importance in their eyes always at the christening now this we can understand because it is an ancient custom amongst human beings as well and it is not hard to explain why wicked fairies should choose the same time to do unkind things but it is difficult to understand how they should be able to do them for you would fancy all wicked creatures would be powerless on such an occasion but i never knew of any interference on the part of the wicked fairy that did not turn out a good thing in the end what a good thing for instance it was that one princess should sleep for a hundred years was she not saved from all the plague of young men who were not worthy of her and did she not come awake exactly at the right moment when the right prince kissed her for my part i cannot help wishing a good many girls would sleep till just the same fate overtook them it would be happier for them and more agreeable to their friends  of course all the known fairies were invited to the christening but the king and queen never thought of inviting an old witch  for the power of the fairies they have by nature whereas a witch gets her power by wickedness the other fairies however knowing the danger thus run provided as well as they could against accidents from her quarter but they could neither render her powerless nor could they arrange their gifts in reference to hers beforehand for they could not tell what those might be  of course the old hag was there without being asked not to be asked was just what she wanted that she might have a sort of reason for doing what she wished to do for somehow even the wickedest of creatures likes a pretext for doing the wrong thing  five fairies had one after the other given the child such gifts as each counted best and the fifth had just stepped back to her place in the surrounding splendour of ladies and gentlemen when mumbling a laugh between her toothless gums the wicked fairy hobbled out into the middle of the circle and at the moment when the archbishop was handing the baby to the lady at the head of the nursery department of state affairs addressed him thus giving a bite or two to every word before she could part with it   please your grace i'm very deaf  would your grace mind repeating the princess's name  with pleasure my good woman said the archbishop stooping to shout in her ear  the infant's name is little daylight  and little daylight it shall be cried the fairy in the tone of a dry axle and little good shall any of her gifts do her for i bestow upon her the gift of sleeping all day long whether she will or not ha ha he he hi hi  then out started the sixth fairy who of course the others had arranged should come after the wicked one in order to undo as much as she might  if she sleep all day she said mournfully she shall at least wake all night  a nice prospect for her mother and me thought the poor king for they loved her far too much to give her up to nurses especially at night as most kings and queens do and are sorry for it afterwards  you spoke before i had done said the wicked fairy that's against the law it gives me another chance  i beg your pardon said the other fairies all together  she did i hadn't done laughing said the crone i had only got to hi hi and i had to go through ho ho and hu hu so i decree that if she wakes all night she shall wax and wane with its mistress the moon and what that may mean i hope her royal parents will live to see ho ho hu hu  but out stepped another fairy for they had been wise enough to keep two in reserve because every fairy knew the trick of one  until said the seventh fairy a prince comes who shall kiss her without knowing it  the wicked fairy made a horrid noise like an angry cat and hobbled away she could not pretend that she had not finished her speech this time for she had laughed ho ho and hu hu  i don't know what that means said the poor king to the seventh fairy  don't be afraid the meaning will come with the thing itself said she  the assembly broke up miserable enough the queen at least prepared for a good many sleepless nights and the lady at the head of the nursery department anything but comfortable in the prospect before her for of course the queen could not do it all as for the king he made up his mind with what courage he could summon to meet the demands of the case but wondered whether he could with any propriety require the first lord of the treasury to take a share in the burden laid upon him  i will not attempt to describe what they had to go through for some time but at last the household settled into a regular system a very irregular one in some respects for at certain seasons the palace rang all night with bursts of laughter from little daylight whose heart the old fairy's curse could not reach she was daylight still only a little in the wrong place for she always dropped asleep at the first hint of dawn in the east but her merriment was of short duration when the moon was at the full she was in glorious spirits and as beautiful as it was possible for a child of her age to be but as the moon waned she faded until at last she was wan and withered like the poorest sickliest child you might come upon in the streets of a great city in the arms of a homeless mother then the night was quiet as the day for the little creature lay in her gorgeous cradle night and day with hardly a motion and indeed at last without even a moan like one dead at first they often thought she was dead but at last they got used to it and only consulted the almanac to find the moment when she would begin to revive which of course was with the first appearance of the silver thread of the crescent moon then she would move her lips and they would give her a little nourishment and she would grow better and better and better until for a few days she was splendidly well when well she was always merriest out in the moonlight but even when near her worst she seemed better when in warm summer nights they carried her cradle out into the light of the waning moon then in her sleep she would smile the faintest most pitiful smile  for a long time very few people ever saw her awake as she grew older she became such a favourite however that about the palace there were always some who would contrive to keep awake at night in order to be near her but she soon began to take every chance of getting away from her nurses and enjoying her moonlight alone and thus things went on until she was nearly seventeen years of age her father and mother had by that time got so used to the odd state of things that they had ceased to wonder at them all their arrangements had reference to the state of the princess daylight and it is amazing how things contrive to accommodate themselves but how any prince was ever to find and deliver her appeared inconceivable  as she grew older she had grown more and more beautiful with the sunniest hair and the loveliest eyes of heavenly blue brilliant and profound as the sky of a june day but so much more painful and sad was the change as her bad time came on the more beautiful she was in the full moon the more withered and worn did she become as the moon waned at the time at which my story has now arrived she looked when the moon was small or gone like an old woman exhausted with suffering this was the more painful that her appearance was unnatural for her hair and eyes did not change her wan face was both drawn and wrinkled and had an eager hungry look her skinny hands moved as if wishing but unable to lay hold of something her shoulders were bent forward her chest went in and she stooped as if she were eighty years old at last she had to be put to bed and there await the flow of the tide of life but she grew to dislike being seen still more being touched by any hands during this season one lovely summer evening when the moon lay all but gone upon the verge of the horizon she vanished from her attendants and it was only after searching for her a long time in great terror that they found her fast asleep in the forest at the foot of a silver birch and carried her home  a little way from the palace there was a great open glade covered with the greenest and softest grass this was her favourite haunt for here the full moon shone free and glorious while through a vista in the trees she could generally see more or less of the dying moon as it crossed the opening here she had a little rustic house built for her and here she mostly resided none of the court might go there without leave and her own attendants had learned by this time not to be officious in waiting upon her so that she was very much at liberty whether the good fairies had anything to do with it or not i cannot tell but at last she got into the way of retreating further into the wood every night as the moon waned so that sometimes they had great trouble in finding her but as she was always very angry if she discovered they were watching her they scarcely dared to do so at length one night they thought they had lost her altogether it was morning before they found her feeble as she was she had wandered into a thicket a long way from the glade and there she lay fast asleep of course  although the fame of her beauty and sweetness had gone abroad yet as everybody knew she was under a bad spell no king in the neighbourhood had any desire to have her for a daughter-in-law there were serious objections to such a relation  about this time in a neighbouring kingdom in consequence of the wickedness of the nobles an insurrection took place upon the death of the old king the greater part of the nobility was massacred and the young prince was compelled to flee for his life disguised like a peasant for some time until he got out of the country he suffered much from hunger and fatigue but when he got into that ruled by the princess's father and had no longer any fear of being recognised he fared better for the people were kind he did not abandon his disguise however one tolerable reason was that he had no other clothes to put on and another that he had very little money and did not know where to get any more there was no good in telling everybody he met that he was a prince for he felt that a prince ought to be able to get on like other people else his rank only made a fool of him he had read of princes setting out upon adventure and here he was out in similar case only without having had a choice in the matter he would go on and see what would come of it  for a day or two he had been walking through the palace-wood and had had next to nothing to eat when he came upon the strangest little house inhabited by a very nice tidy motherly old woman this was one of the good fairies the moment she saw him she knew quite well who he was and what was going to come of it but she was not at liberty to interfere with the orderly march of events she received him with the kindness she would have shown to any other traveller and gave him bread and milk which he thought the most delicious food he had ever tasted wondering that they did not have it for dinner at the palace sometimes the old woman pressed him to stay all night when he awoke he was amazed to find how well and strong he felt she would not take any of the money he offered but begged him if he found occasion of continuing in the neighbourhood to return and occupy the same quarters  thank you much good mother answered the prince but there is little chance of that the sooner i get out of this wood the better  i don't know that said the fairy  what do you mean asked the prince  why how should i know returned she  i can't tell said the prince  very well said the fairy  how strangely you talk said the prince  do i said the fairy  yes you do said the prince  very well said the fairy  the prince was not used to be spoken to in this fashion so he felt a little angry and turned and walked away but this did not offend the fairy she stood at the door of her little house looking after him till the trees hid him quite then she said at last and went in  the prince wandered and wandered and got nowhere the sun sank and sank and went out of sight and he seemed no nearer the end of the wood than ever he sat down on a fallen tree ate a bit of bread the old woman had given him and waited for the moon for although he was not much of an astronomer he knew the moon would rise some time because she had risen the night before up she came slow and slow but of a good size pretty nearly round indeed whereupon greatly refreshed with his piece of bread he got up and went he knew not whither  after walking a considerable distance he thought he was coming to the outside of the forest but when he reached what he thought the last of it he found himself only upon the edge of a great open space in it covered with grass the moon shone very bright and he thought he had never seen a more lovely spot still it looked dreary because of its loneliness for he could not see the house at the other side he sat down weary again and gazed into the glade he had not seen so much room for several days  all at once he spied something in the middle of the grass what could it be it moved it came nearer was it a human creature gliding across a girl dressed in white gleaming in the moonshine she came nearer and nearer he crept behind a tree and watched wondering it must be some strange being of the wood a nymph whom the moonlight and the warm dusky air had enticed from her tree but when she came close to where he stood he no longer doubted she was human for he had caught sight of her sunny hair and her clear blue eyes and the loveliest face and form that he had ever seen all at once she began singing like a nightingale and dancing to her own music with her eyes ever turned towards the moon she passed close to where he stood dancing on by the edge of the trees and away in a great circle towards the other side until he could see but a spot of white in the yellowish green of the moonlit grass but when he feared it would vanish quite the spot grew and became a figure once more she approached him again singing and dancing and waving her arms over her head until she had completed the circle just opposite his tree she stood ceased her song dropped her arms and broke out into a long clear laugh musical as a brook then as if tired she threw herself on the grass and lay gazing at the moon the prince was almost afraid to breathe lest he should startle her and she should vanish from his sight as to venturing near her that never came into his head  she had lain for a long hour or longer when the prince began again to doubt concerning her perhaps she was but a vision of his own fancy or was she a spirit of the wood after all if so he too would haunt the wood glad to have lost kingdom and everything for the hope of being near her he would build him a hut in the forest and there he would live for the pure chance of seeing her again upon nights like this at least she would come out and bask in the moonlight and make his soul blessed but while he thus dreamed she sprang to her feet turned her face full to the moon and began singing as she would draw her down from the sky by the power of her entrancing voice she looked more beautiful than ever again she began dancing to her own music and danced away into the distance once more she returned in a similar manner but although he was watching as eagerly as before what with fatigue and what with gazing he fell fast asleep before she came near him when he awoke it was broad daylight and the princess was nowhere  he could not leave the place what if she should come the next night he would gladly endure a day's hunger to see her yet again  he would buckle his belt quite tight he walked round the glade to see if he could discover any prints of her feet but the grass was so short and her steps had been so light that she had not left a single trace behind her he walked half-way round the wood without seeing anything to account for her presence then he spied a lovely little house with thatched roof and low eaves surrounded by an exquisite garden with doves and peacocks walking in it of course this must be where the gracious lady who loved the moonlight lived forgetting his appearance he walked towards the door determined to make inquiries but as he passed a little pond full of gold and silver fishes he caught sight of himself and turned to find the door to the kitchen there he knocked and asked for a piece of bread the good-natured cook brought him in and gave him an excellent breakfast which the prince found nothing the worse for being served in the kitchen while he ate he talked with his entertainer and learned that this was the favourite retreat of the princess daylight but he learned nothing more both because he was afraid of seeming inquisitive and because the cook did not choose to be heard talking about her mistress to a peasant lad who had begged for his breakfast  as he rose to take his leave it occurred to him that he might not be so far from the old woman's cottage as he had thought and he asked the cook whether she knew anything of such a place describing it as well as he could she said she knew it well enough adding with a smile   it's there you're going is it  yes if it's not far off  it's not more than three miles but mind what you are about you know  why do you say that  if you're after any mischief she'll make you repent it  the best thing that could happen under the circumstances remarked the prince  what do you mean by that asked the cook  why it stands to reason answered the prince that if you wish to do anything wrong the best thing for you is to be made to repent of it  i see said the cook well i think you may venture she's a good old soul  which way does it lie from here asked the prince  she gave him full instructions and he left her with many thanks  being now refreshed however the prince did not go back to the cottage that day  he remained in the forest amusing himself as best he could but waiting anxiously for the night in the hope that the princess would again appear nor was he disappointed for directly the moon rose he spied a glimmering shape far across the glade as it drew nearer he saw it was she indeed not dressed in white as before  in a pale blue like the sky she looked lovelier still he thought it was that the blue suited her yet better than the white he did not know that she was really more beautiful because the moon was nearer the full in fact the next night was full moon and the princess would then be at the zenith of her loveliness  the prince feared for some time that she was not coming near his hiding-place that night but the circles in her dance ever widened as the moon rose until at last they embraced the whole glade and she came still closer to the trees where he was hiding than she had come the night before he was entranced with her loveliness for it was indeed a marvellous thing all night long he watched her but dared not go near her he would have been ashamed of watching her too had he not become almost incapable of thinking of anything but how beautiful she was he watched the whole night long and saw that as the moon went down she retreated in smaller and smaller circles until at last he could see her no more  weary as he was he set out for the old woman's cottage where he arrived just in time for her breakfast which she shared with him he then went to bed and slept for many hours when he awoke the sun was down and he departed in great anxiety lest he should lose a glimpse of the lovely vision but whether it was by the machinations of the swamp-fairy or merely that it is one thing to go and another to return by the same road he lost his way i shall not attempt to describe his misery when the moon rose and he saw nothing but trees trees trees  she was high in the heavens before he reached the glade then indeed his troubles vanished for there was the princess coming dancing towards him in a dress that shone like gold and with shoes that glimmered through the grass like fireflies she was of course still more beautiful than before like an embodied sunbeam she passed him and danced away into the distance  before she returned in her circle the clouds had begun to gather about the moon the wind rose the trees moaned and their lighter branches leaned all one way before it the prince feared that the princess would go in and he should see her no more that night but she came dancing on more jubilant than ever her golden dress and her sunny hair streaming out upon the blast waving her arms towards the moon and in the exuberance of her delight ordering the clouds away from off her face the prince could hardly believe she was not a creature of the elements after all  by the time she had completed another circle the clouds had gathered deep and there were growlings of distant thunder just as she passed the tree where he stood a flash of lightning blinded him for a moment and when he saw again to his horror the princess lay on the ground he darted to her thinking she had been struck but when she heard him coming she was on her feet in a moment  what do you want she asked  i beg your pardon i thought the lightning said the prince hesitating  there's nothing the matter said the princess waving him off rather haughtily  the poor prince turned and walked towards the wood  come back said daylight  i like you you do what you are told are you good  not so good as i should like to be said the prince  then go and grow better said the princess  again the disappointed prince turned and went  come back said the princess  he obeyed and stood before her waiting  can you tell me what the sun is like she asked  no he answered but where's the good of asking what you know  but i don't know she rejoined  why everybody knows  that's the very thing  i'm not everybody i've never seen the sun  then you can't know what it's like till you do see it  i think you must be a prince said the princess  do i look like one said the prince  i can't quite say that  then why do you think so  because you both do what you are told and speak the truth is the sun so very bright  as bright as the lightning  but it doesn't go out like that does it  oh no it shines like the moon rises and sets like the moon is much the same shape as the moon only so bright that you can't look at it for a moment  but i would look at it said the princess  but you couldn't said the prince  but i could said the princess  why don't you then  because i can't  why can't you  because i can't wake and i never shall wake until    here she hid her face in her hands turned away and walked in the slowest stateliest manner towards the house the prince ventured to follow her at a little distance but she turned and made a repellent gesture which like a true gentleman-prince he obeyed at once he waited a long time but as she did not come near him again and as the night had now cleared he set off at last for the old woman's cottage  it was long past midnight when he reached it but to his surprise the old woman was paring potatoes at the door fairies are fond of doing odd things indeed however they may dissemble the night is always their day and so it is with all who have fairy blood in them  why what are you doing there this time of the night mother said the prince for that was the kind way in which any young man in his country would address a woman who was much older than himself  getting your supper ready my son she answered  oh i don't want any supper said the prince  ah you've seen daylight said she  i've seen a princess who never saw it said the prince  do you like her asked the fairy  oh don't i said the prince more than you would believe mother  a fairy can believe anything that ever was or ever could be said the old woman  then are you a fairy asked the prince  yes said she  then what do you do for things not to believe asked the prince  there's plenty of them everything that never was nor ever could be  plenty i grant you said the prince but do you believe there could be a princess who never saw the daylight do you believe that now  this the prince said not that he doubted the princess but that he wanted the fairy to tell him more she was too old a fairy however to be caught so easily  of all people fairies must not tell secrets besides she's a princess  well i'll tell you a secret i'm a prince  i know that  how do you know it  by the curl of the third eyelash on your left eyelid  which corner do you count from  that's a secret  another secret well at least if i am a prince there can be no harm in telling me about a princess  it's just the princes i can't tell  there ain't any more of them are there said the prince  what you don't think you're the only prince in the world do you  oh dear no not at all but i know there's one too many just at present except the princess    yes yes that's it said the fairy  what's it asked the prince  but he could get nothing more out of the fairy and had to go to bed unanswered which was something of a trial  now wicked fairies will not be bound by the law which the good fairies obey and this always seems to give the bad the advantage over the good for they use means to gain their ends which the others will not but it is all of no consequence for what they do never succeeds nay in the end it brings about the very thing they are trying to prevent so you see that somehow for all their cleverness wicked fairies are dreadfully stupid for although from the beginning of the world they have really helped instead of thwarting the good fairies not one of them is a bit wiser for it she will try the bad thing just as they all did before her and succeeds no better of course  the prince had so far stolen a march upon the swamp-fairy that she did not know he was in the neighbourhood until after he had seen the princess those three times when she knew it she consoled herself by thinking that the princess must be far too proud and too modest for any young man to venture even to speak to her before he had seen her six times at least but there was even less danger than the wicked fairy thought for however much the princess might desire to be set free she was dreadfully afraid of the wrong prince now however the fairy was going to do all she could  she so contrived it by her deceitful spells that the next night the prince could not by any endeavour find his way to the glade it would take me too long to tell her tricks they would be amusing to us who know that they could not do any harm but they were something other than amusing to the poor prince he wandered about the forest till daylight and then fell fast asleep the same thing occurred for seven following days during which neither could he find the good fairy's cottage after the third quarter of the moon however the bad fairy thought she might be at ease about the affair for a fortnight at least for there was no chance of the prince wishing to kiss the princess during that period so the first day of the fourth quarter he did find the cottage and the next day he found the glade for nearly another week he haunted it but the princess never came i have little doubt she was on the farther edge of it some part of every night but at this period she always wore black and there being little or no light the prince never saw her nor would he have known her if he had seen her how could he have taken the worn decrepit creature she was now for the glorious princess daylight  at last one night when there was no moon at all he ventured near the house there he heard voices talking although it was past midnight for her women were in considerable uneasiness because the one whose turn it was to watch her had fallen asleep and had not seen which way she went and this was a night when she would probably wander very far describing a circle which did not touch the open glade at all but stretched away from the back of the house deep into that side of the forest a part of which the prince knew nothing when he understood from what they said that she had disappeared and that she must have gone somewhere in the said direction he plunged at once into the wood to see if he could find her for hours he roamed with nothing to guide him but the vague notion of a circle which on one side bordered on the house for so much had he picked up from the talk he had overheard  it was getting towards the dawn but as yet there was no streak of light in the sky when he came to a great birch-tree and sat down weary at the foot of it while he sat very miserable you may be sure full of fear for the princess and wondering how her attendants could take it so quietly he bethought himself that it would not be a bad plan to light a fire which if she were anywhere near would attract her this he managed with a tinder-box which the good fairy had given him it was just beginning to blaze up when he heard a moan which seemed to come from the other side of the tree he sprung to his feet but his heart throbbed so that he had to lean for a moment against the tree before he could move when he got round there lay a human form in a little dark heap on the earth there was light enough from his fire to show that it was not the princess he lifted it in his arms hardly heavier than a child and carried it to the flame the countenance was that of an old woman but it had a fearfully strange look a black hood concealed her hair and her eyes were closed he laid her down as comfortably as he could chafed her hands put a little cordial from a bottle also the gift of the fairy into her mouth took off his coat and wrapped it about her and in short did the best he could in a little while she opened her eyes and looked at him so pitifully the tears rose and flowed from her grey wrinkled cheeks but she said never a word she closed her eyes again but the tears kept on flowing and her whole appearance was so utterly pitiful that the prince was near crying too he begged her to tell him what was the matter promising to do all he could to help her but still she did not speak he thought she was dying and took her in his arms again to carry her to the princess's house where he thought the good-natured cook might be able to do something for her when he lifted her the tears flowed yet faster and she gave such a sad moan that it went to his very heart  mother mother he said poor mother and kissed her on the withered lips  she started and what eyes they were that opened upon him but he did not see them for it was still very dark and he had enough to do to make his way through the trees towards the house  just as he approached the door feeling more tired than he could have imagined possible she was such a little thin old thing she began to move and became so restless that unable to carry her a moment longer he thought to lay her on the grass but she stood upright on her feet her hood had dropped and her hair fell about her the first gleam of the morning was caught on her face  that face was bright as the never-aging dawn and her eyes were lovely as the sky of darkest blue the prince recoiled in overmastering wonder it was daylight herself whom he had brought from the forest he fell at her feet nor dared to look up until she laid her hand upon his head he rose then  you kissed me when i was an old woman  there i kiss you when i am a young princess murmured daylight is that the sun coming     chapter xxix ruby   the children were delighted with the story and made many amusing remarks upon it mr raymond promised to search his brain for another and when he had found one to bring it to them diamond having taken leave of nanny and promised to go and see her again soon went away with him  now mr raymond had been turning over in his mind what he could do both for diamond and for nanny he had therefore made some acquaintance with diamond's father and had been greatly pleased with him but he had come to the resolution before he did anything so good as he would like to do for them to put them all to a certain test so as they walked away together he began to talk with diamond as follows    nanny must leave the hospital soon diamond  i'm glad of that sir  why don't you think it's a nice place  yes very but it's better to be well and doing something you know even if it's not quite so comfortable  but they can't keep nanny so long as they would like they can't keep her till she's quite strong there are always so many sick children they want to take in and make better and the question is what will she do when they send her out again  that's just what i can't tell though i've been thinking of it over and over sir her crossing was taken long ago and i couldn't bear to see nanny fighting for it especially with such a poor fellow as has taken it he's quite lame sir  she doesn't look much like fighting now does she diamond  no sir she looks too like an angel angels don't fight do they sir  not to get things for themselves at least said mr raymond  besides added diamond i don't quite see that she would have any better right to the crossing than the boy who has got it nobody gave it to her she only took it and now he has taken it  if she were to sweep a crossing soon at least after the illness she has had she would be laid up again the very first wet day said mr raymond  and there's hardly any money to be got except on the wet days  remarked diamond reflectively is there nothing else she could do sir  not without being taught i'm afraid  well couldn't somebody teach her something  couldn't you teach her diamond  i don't know anything myself sir i could teach her to dress the baby but nobody would give her anything for doing things like that  they are so easy there wouldn't be much good in teaching her to drive a cab for where would she get the cab to drive there ain't fathers and old diamonds everywhere at least poor nanny can't find any of them i doubt  perhaps if she were taught to be nice and clean and only speak gentle words  mother could teach her that interrupted diamond  and to dress babies and feed them and take care of them mr raymond proceeded she might get a place as a nurse somewhere you know people do give money for that  then i'll ask mother said diamond  but you'll have to give her her food then and your father not being strong has enough to do already without that  but here's me said diamond  i help him out with it when he's tired of driving up i get it don't make any difference to old diamond i don't mean he likes me as well as my father of course he can't you know nobody could but he does his duty all the same it's got to be done you know sir and diamond's a good horse isn't he sir  from your description i should say certainly but i have not the pleasure of his acquaintance myself  don't you think he will go to heaven sir  that i don't know anything about said mr raymond i confess i should be glad to think so he added smiling thoughtfully  i'm sure he'll get to the back of the north wind anyhow said diamond to himself but he had learned to be very careful of saying such things aloud  isn't it rather too much for him to go in the cab all day and every day resumed mr raymond  so father says when he feels his ribs of a morning but then he says the old horse do eat well and the moment he's had his supper down he goes and never gets up till he's called and for the legs of him father says that makes no end of a differ some horses sir they won't lie down all night long but go to sleep on their four pins like a haystack father says i think it's very stupid of them and so does old diamond but then i suppose they don't know better and so they can't help it we mustn't be too hard upon them father says  your father must be a good man diamond diamond looked up in mr raymond's face wondering what he could mean  i said your father must be a good man diamond  of course said diamond how could he drive a cab if he wasn't  there are some men who drive cabs who are not very good objected mr raymond  diamond remembered the drunken cabman and saw that his friend was right  ah but he returned he must be you know with such a horse as old diamond  that does make a difference said mr raymond but it is quite enough that he is a good man without our trying to account for it now if you like i will give you a proof that i think him a good man i am going away on the continent for a while for three months i believe and i am going to let my house to a gentleman who does not want the use of my brougham my horse is nearly as old i fancy as your diamond but i don't want to part with him and i don't want him to be idle for nobody as you say ought to be idle but neither do i want him to be worked very hard now it has come into my head that perhaps your father would take charge of him and work him under certain conditions  my father will do what's right said diamond i'm sure of that  well so i think will you ask him when he comes home to call and have a little chat with me to-day some time  he must have his dinner first said diamond no he's got his dinner with him to-day it must be after he's had his tea  of course of course any time will do i shall be at home all day  very well sir i will tell him you may be sure he will come my father thinks you a very kind gentleman and i know he is right for i know your very own self sir  mr raymond smiled and as they had now reached his door they parted and diamond went home as soon as his father entered the house diamond gave him mr raymond's message and recounted the conversation that had preceded it his father said little but took thought-sauce to his bread and butter and as soon as he had finished his meal rose saying   i will go to your friend directly diamond it would be a grand thing to get a little more money we do want it diamond accompanied his father to mr raymond's door and there left him  he was shown at once into mr raymond's study where he gazed with some wonder at the multitude of books on the walls and thought what a learned man mr raymond must be  presently mr raymond entered and after saying much the same about his old horse made the following distinct proposal one not over-advantageous to diamond's father but for which he had reasons namely that joseph should have the use of mr raymond's horse while he was away on condition that he never worked him more than six hours a day and fed him well and that besides he should take nanny home as soon as she was able to leave the hospital and provide for her as one of his own children neither better nor worse so long that is as he had the horse  diamond's father could not help thinking it a pretty close bargain he should have both the girl and the horse to feed and only six hours' work out of the horse  it will save your own horse said mr raymond  that is true answered joseph but all i can get by my own horse is only enough to keep us and if i save him and feed your horse and the girl don't you see sir  well you can go home and think about it and let me know by the end of the week i am in no hurry before then  so joseph went home and recounted the proposal to his wife adding that he did not think there was much advantage to be got out of it  not much that way husband said diamond's mother but there would be an advantage and what matter who gets it  i don't see it answered her husband mr raymond is a gentleman of property and i don't discover any much good in helping him to save a little more he won't easily get one to make such a bargain and i don't mean he shall get me it would be a loss rather than a gain i do think at least if i took less work out of our own horse  one hour would make a difference to old diamond but that's not the main point you must think what an advantage it would be to the poor girl that hasn't a home to go to  she is one of diamond's friends thought his father  i could be kind to her you know the mother went on and teach her housework and how to handle a baby and besides she would help me and i should be the stronger for it and able to do an odd bit of charing now and then when i got the chance  i won't hear of that said her husband have the girl by all means i'm ashamed i did not think of both sides of the thing at once i wonder if the horse is a great eater to be sure if i gave diamond two hours' additional rest it would be all the better for the old bones of him and there would be four hours extra out of the other horse that would give diamond something to do every day he could drive old diamond after dinner and i could take the other horse out for six hours after tea or in the morning as i found best it might pay for the keep of both of them that is if i had good luck i should like to oblige mr raymond though he be rather hard for he has been very kind to our diamond wife hasn't he now  he has indeed joseph said his wife and there the conversation ended  diamond's father went the very next day to mr raymond and accepted his proposal so that the week after having got another stall in the same stable he had two horses instead of one oddly enough the name of the new horse was ruby for he was a very red chestnut diamond's name came from a white lozenge on his forehead young diamond said they were rich now with such a big diamond and such a big ruby     chapter xxx nanny's dream   nanny was not fit to be moved for some time yet and diamond went to see her as often as he could but being more regularly engaged now seeing he went out every day for a few hours with old diamond and had his baby to mind and one of the horses to attend to he could not go so often as he would have liked  one evening as he sat by her bedside she said to him   i've had such a beautiful dream diamond i should like to tell it you  oh do said diamond i am so fond of dreams  she must have been to the back of the north wind he said to himself  it was a very foolish dream you know but somehow it was so pleasant what a good thing it is that you believe the dream all the time you are in it  my readers must not suppose that poor nanny was able to say what she meant so well as i put it down here she had never been to school and had heard very little else than vulgar speech until she came to the hospital but i have been to school and although that could never make me able to dream so well as nanny it has made me able to tell her dream better than she could herself and i am the more desirous of doing this for her that i have already done the best i could for diamond's dream and it would be a shame to give the boy all the advantage  i will tell you all i know about it said nanny the day before yesterday a lady came to see us a very beautiful lady and very beautifully dressed i heard the matron say to her that it was very kind of her to come in blue and gold and she answered that she knew we didn't like dull colours she had such a lovely shawl on just like redness dipped in milk and all worked over with flowers of the same colour it didn't shine much it was silk but it kept in the shine when she came to my bedside she sat down just where you are sitting diamond and laid her hand on the counterpane i was sitting up with my table before me ready for my tea her hand looked so pretty in its blue glove that i was tempted to stroke it i thought she wouldn't be angry for everybody that comes to the hospital is kind it's only in the streets they ain't kind but she drew her hand away and i almost cried for i thought i had been rude instead of that however it was only that she didn't like giving me her glove to stroke for she drew it off and then laid her hand where it was before i wasn't sure but i ventured to put out my ugly hand  your hand ain't ugly nanny said diamond but nanny went on   and i stroked it again and then she stroked mine think of that and there was a ring on her finger and i looked down to see what it was like and she drew it off and put it upon one of my fingers it was a red stone and she told me they called it a ruby  oh that is funny said diamond our new horse is called ruby we've got another horse a red one such a beauty  but nanny went on with her story  i looked at the ruby all the time the lady was talking to me it was so beautiful and as she talked i kept seeing deeper and deeper into the stone at last she rose to go away and i began to pull the ring off my finger and what do you think she said 'wear it all night if you like only you must take care of it i can't give it you for some one gave it to me but you may keep it till to-morrow' wasn't it kind of her i could hardly take my tea i was so delighted to hear it and i do think it was the ring that set me dreaming for after i had taken my tea i leaned back half lying and half sitting and looked at the ring on my finger by degrees i began to dream the ring grew larger and larger until at last i found that i was not looking at a red stone but at a red sunset which shone in at the end of a long street near where grannie lives i was dressed in rags as i used to be and i had great holes in my shoes at which the nasty mud came through to my feet i didn't use to mind it before but now i thought it horrid and there was the great red sunset with streaks of green and gold between standing looking at me why couldn't i live in the sunset instead of in that dirt why was it so far away always why did it never come into our wretched street it faded away as the sunsets always do and at last went out altogether then a cold wind began to blow and flutter all my rags about    that was north wind herself said diamond  eh said nanny and went on with her story  i turned my back to it and wandered away i did not know where i was going only it was warmer to go that way i don't think it was a north wind for i found myself in the west end at last but it doesn't matter in a dream which wind it was  i don't know that said diamond i believe north wind can get into our dreams yes and blow in them sometimes she has blown me out of a dream altogether  i don't know what you mean diamond said nanny  never mind answered diamond two people can't always understand each other they'd both be at the back of the north wind directly and what would become of the other places without them  you do talk so oddly said nanny i sometimes think they must have been right about you  what did they say about me asked diamond  they called you god's baby  how kind of them but i knew that  did you know what it meant though it meant that you were not right in the head  i feel all right said diamond putting both hands to his head as if it had been a globe he could take off and set on again  well as long as you are pleased i am pleased said nanny  thank you nanny do go on with your story i think i like dreams even better than fairy tales but they must be nice ones like yours you know  well i went on keeping my back to the wind until i came to a fine street on the top of a hill how it happened i don't know but the front door of one of the houses was open and not only the front door but the back door as well so that i could see right through the house and what do you think i saw a garden place with green grass and the moon shining upon it think of that there was no moon in the street but through the house there was the moon i looked and there was nobody near  i would not do any harm and the grass was so much nicer than the mud but i couldn't think of going on the grass with such dirty shoes  i kicked them off in the gutter and ran in on my bare feet up the steps and through the house and on to the grass and the moment i came into the moonlight i began to feel better  that's why north wind blew you there said diamond  it came of mr raymond's story about princess daylight returned nanny well i lay down upon the grass in the moonlight without thinking how i was to get out again somehow the moon suited me exactly there was not a breath of the north wind you talk about it was quite gone  you didn't want her any more just then she never goes where she's not wanted said diamond but she blew you into the moonlight anyhow  well we won't dispute about it said nanny  you've got a tile loose you know  suppose i have returned diamond don't you see it may let in the moonlight or the sunlight for that matter  perhaps yes perhaps no said nanny  and you've got your dreams too nanny  yes but i know they're dreams  so do i but i know besides they are something more as well  oh do you rejoined nanny i don't  all right said diamond perhaps you will some day  perhaps i won't said nanny  diamond held his peace and nanny resumed her story  i lay a long time and the moonlight got in at every tear in my clothes and made me feel so happy    there i tell you said diamond  what do you tell me returned nanny  north wind    it was the moonlight i tell you persisted nanny and again diamond held his peace  all at once i felt that the moon was not shining so strong i looked up and there was a cloud all crapey and fluffy trying to drown the beautiful creature but the moon was so round just like a whole plate that the cloud couldn't stick to her she shook it off and said there and shone out clearer and brighter than ever but up came a thicker cloud and 'you shan't' said the moon and 'i will' said the cloud but it couldn't  out shone the moon quite laughing at its impudence i knew her ways for i've always been used to watch her she's the only thing worth looking at in our street at night  don't call it your street said diamond you're not going back to it you're coming to us you know  that's too good to be true said nanny  there are very few things good enough to be true said diamond but i hope this is too good to be true it can't be isn't true good and isn't good good and how then can anything be too good to be true that's like old sal to say that  don't abuse grannie diamond she's a horrid old thing she and her gin bottle but she'll repent some day and then you'll be glad not to have said anything against her  why said diamond  because you'll be sorry for her  i am sorry for her now  very well that's right she'll be sorry too and there'll be an end of it  all right you come to us said diamond  where was i said nanny  telling me how the moon served the clouds  yes but it wouldn't do all of it up came the clouds and the clouds and they came faster and faster until the moon was covered up you couldn't expect her to throw off a hundred of them at once could you  certainly not said diamond  so it grew very dark and a dog began to yelp in the house i looked and saw that the door to the garden was shut presently it was opened not to let me out but to let the dog in yelping and bounding i thought if he caught sight of me i was in for a biting first and the police after so i jumped up and ran for a little summer-house in the corner of the garden the dog came after me but i shut the door in his face it was well it had a door wasn't it  you dreamed of the door because you wanted it said diamond  no i didn't it came of itself it was there in the true dream  there i've caught you said diamond i knew you believed in the dream as much as i do  oh well if you will lay traps for a body said nanny anyhow i was safe inside the summer-house and what do you think there was the moon beginning to shine again but only through one of the panes and that one was just the colour of the ruby wasn't it funny  no not a bit funny said diamond  if you will be contrary said nanny  no no said diamond i only meant that was the very pane i should have expected her to shine through  oh very well returned nanny  what diamond meant i do not pretend to say he had curious notions about things  and now said nanny i didn't know what to do for the dog kept barking at the door and i couldn't get out but the moon was so beautiful that i couldn't keep from looking at it through the red pane and as i looked it got larger and larger till it filled the whole pane and outgrew it so that i could see it through the other panes and it grew till it filled them too and the whole window so that the summer-house was nearly as bright as day  the dog stopped barking and i heard a gentle tapping at the door like the wind blowing a little branch against it  just like her said diamond who thought everything strange and beautiful must be done by north wind  so i turned from the window and opened the door and what do you think i saw  a beautiful lady said diamond  no the moon itself as big as a little house and as round as a ball shining like yellow silver it stood on the grass down on the very grass  i could see nothing else for the brightness of it  and as i stared and wondered a door opened in the side of it near the ground and a curious little old man with a crooked thing over his shoulder looked out and said  'come along nanny my lady wants you we're come to fetch you i wasn't a bit frightened i went up to the beautiful bright thing and the old man held down his hand and i took hold of it and gave a jump and he gave me a lift and i was inside the moon and what do you think it was like it was such a pretty little house with blue windows and white curtains at one of the windows sat a beautiful lady with her head leaning on her hand looking out she seemed rather sad and i was sorry for her and stood staring at her  `you didn't think i had such a beautiful mistress as that' said the queer little man `no indeed' i answered  `who would have thought it' `ah who indeed but you see you don't know everything' the little man closed the door and began to pull at a rope which hung behind it with a weight at the end after he had pulled a while he said `there that will do we're all right now' then he took me by the hand and opened a little trap in the floor and led me down two or three steps and i saw like a great hole below me `don't be frightened' said the tittle man `it's not a hole it's only a window put your face down and look through' i did as he told me and there was the garden and the summer-house far away lying at the bottom of the moonlight `there' said the little man `we've brought you off do you see the little dog barking at us down there in the garden' i told him i couldn't see anything so far `can you see anything so small and so far off' i said `bless you child' said the little man `i could pick up a needle out of the grass if i had only a long enough arm there's one lying by the door of the summer-house now' i looked at his eyes they were very small but so bright that i think he saw by the light that went out of them then he took me up and up again by a little stair in a corner of the room and through another trapdoor and there was one great round window above us and i saw the blue sky and the clouds and such lots of stars all so big and shining as hard as ever they could  the little girl-angels had been polishing them said diamond  what nonsense you do talk said nanny  but my nonsense is just as good as yours nanny when you have done i'll tell you my dream the stars are in it not the moon though she was away somewhere perhaps she was gone to fetch you then i don't think that though for my dream was longer ago than yours she might have been to fetch some one else though for we can't fancy it's only us that get such fine things done for them but do tell me what came next  perhaps one of my child-readers may remember whether the moon came down to fetch him or her the same night that diamond had his dream i cannot tell of course i know she did not come to fetch me though i did think i could make her follow me when i was a boy not a very tiny one either  the little man took me all round the house and made me look out of every window oh it was beautiful there we were all up in the air in such a nice clean little house `your work will be to keep the windows bright' said the little man `you won't find it very difficult for there ain't much dust up here only the frost settles on them sometimes and the drops of rain leave marks on them' `i can easily clean them inside' i said `but how am i to get the frost and rain off the outside of them' `oh' he said `it's quite easy there are ladders all about you've only got to go out at the door and climb about there are a great many windows you haven't seen yet and some of them look into places you don't know anything about i used to clean them myself but i'm getting rather old you see ain't i now' `i can't tell' i answered `you see i never saw you when you were younger' `never saw the man in the moon' said he `not very near' i answered `not to tell how young or how old he looked i have seen the bundle of sticks on his back' for jim had pointed that out to me jim was very fond of looking at the man in the moon poor jim i wonder he hasn't been to see me i'm afraid he's ill too  i'll try to find out said diamond and let you know  thank you said nanny you and jim ought to be friends  but what did the man in the moon say when you told him you had seen him with the bundle of sticks on his back  he laughed but i thought he looked offended too his little nose turned up sharper and he drew the corners of his mouth down from the tips of his ears into his neck but he didn't look cross you know  didn't he say anything  oh yes he said  `that's all nonsense what you saw was my bundle of dusters i was going to clean the windows it takes a good many you know really what they do say of their superiors down there' `it's only because they don't know better' i ventured to say `of course of course' said the little man `nobody ever does know better well i forgive them and that sets it all right i hope' `it's very good of you' i said `no' said he `it's not in the least good of me i couldn't be comfortable otherwise' after this he said nothing for a while and i laid myself on the floor of his garret and stared up and around at the great blue beautifulness i had forgotten him almost when at last he said  `ain't you done yet' `done what' i asked `done saying your prayers' says he 'i wasn't saying my prayers' i answered `oh yes you were' said he `though you didn't know it and now i must show you something else'  he took my hand and led me down the stair again and through a narrow passage and through another and another and another i don't know how there could be room for so many passages in such a little house the heart of it must be ever so much farther from the sides than they are from each other how could it have an inside that was so independent of its outside there's the point it was funny wasn't it diamond  no said diamond he was going to say that that was very much the sort of thing at the back of the north wind but he checked himself and only added all right i don't see it i don't see why the inside should depend on the outside it ain't so with the crabs they creep out of their outsides and make new ones mr raymond told me so  i don't see what that has got to do with it said nanny  then go on with your story please said diamond what did you come to after going through all those winding passages into the heart of the moon  i didn't say they were winding passages i said they were long and narrow they didn't wind they went by corners  that's worth knowing remarked diamond for who knows how soon he may have to go there but the main thing is what did you come to at last  we came to a small box against the wall of a tiny room the little man told me to put my ear against it i did so and heard a noise something like the purring of a cat only not so loud and much sweeter `what is it' i asked `don't you know the sound' returned the little man `no' i answered `don't you know the sound of bees' he said i had never heard bees and could not know the sound of them `those are my lady's bees' he went on i had heard that bees gather honey from the flowers `but where are the flowers for them' i asked `my lady's bees gather their honey from the sun and the stars' said the little man `do let me see them' i said `no i daren't do that' he answered `i have no business with them i don't understand them besides they are so bright that if one were to fly into your eye it would blind you altogether' `then you have seen them' `oh yes once or twice i think but i don't quite know  they are so very bright like buttons of lightning now i've showed you all i can to-night and we'll go back to the room' i followed him and he made me sit down under a lamp that hung from the roof and gave me some bread and honey  the lady had never moved she sat with her forehead leaning on her hand gazing out of the little window hung like the rest with white cloudy curtains from where i was sitting i looked out of it too but i could see nothing her face was very beautiful and very white and very still and her hand was as white as the forehead that leaned on it i did not see her whole face only the side of it for she never moved to turn it full upon me or even to look at me  how long i sat after i had eaten my bread and honey i don't know the little man was busy about the room pulling a string here and a string there but chiefly the string at the back of the door i was thinking with some uneasiness that he would soon be wanting me to go out and clean the windows and i didn't fancy the job at last he came up to me with a great armful of dusters `it's time you set about the windows' he said `for there's rain coming and if they're quite clean before then the rain can't spoil them' i got up at once `you needn't be afraid' he said `you won't tumble off only you must be careful always hold on with one hand while you rub with the other' as he spoke he opened the door i started back in a terrible fright for there was nothing but blue air to be seen under me like a great water without a bottom at all but what must be must and to live up here was so much nicer than down in the mud with holes in my shoes that i never thought of not doing as i was told the little man showed me how and where to lay hold while i put my foot round the edge of the door on to the first round of a ladder `once you're up' he said `you'll see how you have to go well enough' i did as he told me and crept out very carefully then the little man handed me the bundle of dusters saying `i always carry them on my reaping hook but i don't think you could manage it properly you shall have it if you like' i wouldn't take it however for it looked dangerous  i did the best i could with the dusters and crawled up to the top of the moon but what a grand sight it was the stars were all over my head so bright and so near that i could almost have laid hold of them the round ball to which i clung went bobbing and floating away through the dark blue above and below and on every side it was so beautiful that all fear left me and i set to work diligently i cleaned window after window at length i came to a very little one in at which i peeped there was the room with the box of bees in it i laid my ear to the window and heard the musical hum quite distinctly a great longing to see them came upon me and i opened the window and crept in the little box had a door like a closet i opened it the tiniest crack when out came the light with such a sting that i closed it again in terror not however before three bees had shot out into the room where they darted about like flashes of lightning terribly frightened i tried to get out of the window again but i could not  there was no way to the outside of the moon but through the door and that was in the room where the lady sat no sooner had i reached the room than the three bees which had followed me flew at once to the lady and settled upon her hair then first i saw her move she started put up her hand and caught them then rose and having held them into the flame of the lamp one after the other turned to me her face was not so sad now as stern it frightened me much `nanny you have got me into trouble' she said `you have been letting out my bees which it is all i can do to manage you have forced me to burn them it is a great loss and there will be a storm' as she spoke the clouds had gathered all about us i could see them come crowding up white about the windows `i am sorry to find' said the lady `that you are not to be trusted you must go home again you won't do for us' then came a great clap of thunder and the moon rocked and swayed all grew dark about me and i fell on the floor and lay half-stunned i could hear everything but could see nothing `shall i throw her out of the door my lady' said the little man `no' she answered `she's not quite bad enough for that i don't think there's much harm in her only she'll never do for us she would make dreadful mischief up here she's only fit for the mud it's a great pity i am sorry for her just take that ring off her finger i am sadly afraid she has stolen it' the little man caught hold of my hand and i felt him tugging at the ring i tried to speak what was true about it but after a terrible effort only gave a groan other things began to come into my head somebody else had a hold of me the little man wasn't there i opened my eyes at last and saw the nurse i had cried out in my sleep and she had come and waked me but diamond for all it was only a dream i cannot help being ashamed of myself yet for opening the lady's box of bees  you wouldn't do it again would you if she were to take you back  said diamond  no i don't think anything would ever make me do it again but where's the good i shall never have the chance  i don't know that said diamond  you silly baby it was only a dream said nanny  i know that nanny dear but how can you tell you mayn't dream it again  that's not a bit likely  i don't know that said diamond  you're always saying that said nanny i don't like it  then i won't say it again if i don't forget said diamond but it was such a beautiful dream wasn't it nanny what a pity you opened that door and let the bees out you might have had such a long dream and such nice talks with the moon-lady do try to go again nanny i do so want to hear more  but now the nurse came and told him it was time to go and diamond went saying to himself i can't help thinking that north wind had something to do with that dream it would be tiresome to lie there all day and all night too without dreaming perhaps if she hadn't done that the moon might have carried her to the back of the north wind who knows     chapter xxxi the north wind doth blow   it was a great delight to diamond when at length nanny was well enough to leave the hospital and go home to their house she was not very strong yet but diamond's mother was very considerate of her and took care that she should have nothing to do she was not quite fit for if nanny had been taken straight from the street it is very probable she would not have been so pleasant in a decent household or so easy to teach but after the refining influences of her illness and the kind treatment she had had in the hospital she moved about the house just like some rather sad pleasure haunting the mind as she got better and the colour came back to her cheeks her step grew lighter and quicker her smile shone out more readily and it became certain that she would soon be a treasure of help it was great fun to see diamond teaching her how to hold the baby and wash and dress him and often they laughed together over her awkwardness but she had not many such lessons before she was able to perform those duties quite as well as diamond himself  things however did not go well with joseph from the very arrival of ruby it almost seemed as if the red beast had brought ill luck with him the fares were fewer and the pay less ruby's services did indeed make the week's income at first a little beyond what it used to be but then there were two more to feed after the first month he fell lame and for the whole of the next joseph dared not attempt to work him i cannot say that he never grumbled for his own health was far from what it had been but i can say that he tried to do his best during all that month they lived on very short commons indeed seldom tasting meat except on sundays and poor old diamond who worked hardest of all not even then so that at the end of it he was as thin as a clothes-horse while ruby was as plump and sleek as a bishop's cob  nor was it much better after ruby was able to work again for it was a season of great depression in business and that is very soon felt amongst the cabmen city men look more after their shillings and their wives and daughters have less to spend it was besides a wet autumn and bread rose greatly in price when i add to this that diamond's mother was but poorly for a new baby was coming you will see that these were not very jolly times for our friends in the mews  notwithstanding the depressing influences around him joseph was able to keep a little hope alive in his heart and when he came home at night would get diamond to read to him and would also make nanny produce her book that he might see how she was getting on for diamond had taken her education in hand and as she was a clever child she was very soon able to put letters and words together  thus the three months passed away but mr raymond did not return joseph had been looking anxiously for him chiefly with the desire of getting rid of ruby not that he was absolutely of no use to him but that he was a constant weight upon his mind indeed as far as provision went he was rather worse off with ruby and nanny than he had been before but on the other hand nanny was a great help in the house and it was a comfort to him to think that when the new baby did come nanny would be with his wife  of god's gifts a baby is of the greatest therefore it is no wonder that when this one came she was as heartily welcomed by the little household as if she had brought plenty with her of course she made a great difference in the work to be done far more difference than her size warranted but nanny was no end of help and diamond was as much of a sunbeam as ever and began to sing to the new baby the first moment he got her in his arms but he did not sing the same songs to her that he had sung to his brother for he said she was a new baby and must have new songs and besides she was a sister-baby and not a brother-baby and of course would not like the same kind of songs where the difference in his songs lay however i do not pretend to be able to point out one thing i am sure of that they not only had no small share in the education of the little girl but helped the whole family a great deal more than they were aware  how they managed to get through the long dreary expensive winter i can hardly say sometimes things were better sometimes worse but at last the spring came and the winter was over and gone and that was much still mr raymond did not return and although the mother would have been able to manage without nanny now they could not look for a place for her so long as they had ruby and they were not altogether sorry for this one week at last was worse than they had yet had they were almost without bread before it was over but the sadder he saw his father and mother looking the more diamond set himself to sing to the two babies  one thing which had increased their expenses was that they had been forced to hire another little room for nanny when the second baby came diamond gave up his room that nanny might be at hand to help his mother and went to hers which although a fine place to what she had been accustomed to was not very nice in his eyes he did not mind the change though for was not his mother the more comfortable for it and was not nanny more comfortable too and indeed was not diamond himself more comfortable that other people were more comfortable and if there was more comfort every way the change was a happy one     chapter xxxii diamond and ruby   it was friday night and diamond like the rest of the household had had very little to eat that day the mother would always pay the week's rent before she laid out anything even on food his father had been very gloomy so gloomy that he had actually been cross to his wife it is a strange thing how pain of seeing the suffering of those we love will sometimes make us add to their suffering by being cross with them this comes of not having faith enough in god and shows how necessary this faith is for when we lose it we lose even the kindness which alone can soothe the suffering diamond in consequence had gone to bed very quiet and thoughtful a little troubled indeed  it had been a very stormy winter and even now that the spring had come the north wind often blew when diamond went to his bed which was in a tiny room in the roof he heard it like the sea moaning and when he fell asleep he still heard the moaning all at once he said to himself am i awake or am i asleep but he had no time to answer the question for there was north wind calling him his heart beat very fast it was such a long time since he had heard that voice he jumped out of bed and looked everywhere but could not see her diamond come here she said again and again but where the here was he could not tell to be sure the room was all but quite dark and she might be close beside him  dear north wind said diamond i want so much to go to you but i can't tell where  come here diamond was all her answer  diamond opened the door and went out of the room and down the stair and into the yard his little heart was in a flutter for he had long given up all thought of seeing her again neither now was he to see her when he got out a great puff of wind came against him and in obedience to it he turned his back and went as it blew it blew him right up to the stable-door and went on blowing  she wants me to go into the stable said diamond to himself but the door is locked  he knew where the key was in a certain hole in the wall far too high for him to get at he ran to the place however  just as he reached it there came a wild blast and down fell the key clanging on the stones at his feet he picked it up and ran back and opened the stable-door and went in and what do you think he saw  a little light came through the dusty window from a gas-lamp sufficient to show him diamond and ruby with their two heads up looking at each other across the partition of their stalls the light showed the white mark on diamond's forehead but ruby's eye shone so bright that he thought more light came out of it than went in this is what he saw  but what do you think he heard  he heard the two horses talking to each other in a strange language which yet somehow or other he could understand and turn over in his mind in english the first words he heard were from diamond who apparently had been already quarrelling with ruby  look how fat you are ruby said old diamond you are so plump and your skin shines so you ought to be ashamed of yourself  there's no harm in being fat said ruby in a deprecating tone no nor in being sleek i may as well shine as not  no harm retorted diamond is it no harm to go eating up all poor master's oats and taking up so much of his time grooming you when you only work six hours no not six hours a day and as i hear get along no faster than a big dray-horse with two tons behind him so they tell me  your master's not mine said ruby i must attend to my own master's interests and eat all that is given me and be sleek and fat as i can and go no faster than i need  now really if the rest of the horses weren't all asleep poor things they work till they're tired i do believe they would get up and kick you out of the stable you make me ashamed of being a horse you dare to say my master ain't your master that's your gratitude for the way he feeds you and spares you pray where would your carcass be if it weren't for him  he doesn't do it for my sake if i were his own horse he would work me as hard as he does you  and i'm proud to be so worked i wouldn't be as fat as you not for all you're worth you're a disgrace to the stable look at the horse next you he's something like a horse all skin and bone and his master ain't over kind to him either he put a stinging lash on his whip last week but that old horse knows he's got the wife and children to keep as well as his drunken master and he works like a horse i daresay he grudges his master the beer he drinks but i don't believe he grudges anything else  well i don't grudge yours what he gets by me said ruby  gets retorted diamond what he gets isn't worth grudging it comes to next to nothing what with your fat and shine  well at least you ought to be thankful you're the better for it you get a two hours' rest a day out of it  i thank my master for that not you you lazy fellow you go along like a buttock of beef upon castors you do  ain't you afraid i'll kick if you go on like that diamond  kick you couldn't kick if you tried you might heave your rump up half a foot but for lashing out oho if you did you'd be down on your belly before you could get your legs under you again it's my belief once out they'd stick out for ever talk of kicking why don't you put one foot before the other now and then when you're in the cab the abuse master gets for your sake is quite shameful no decent horse would bring it on him depend upon it ruby no cabman likes to be abused any more than his fare but his fares at least when you are between the shafts are very much to be excused indeed they are  well you see diamond i don't want to go lame again  i don't believe you were so very lame after all there  oh but i was  then i believe it was all your own fault i'm not lame i never was lame in all my life you don't take care of your legs you never lay them down at night there you are with your huge carcass crushing down your poor legs all night long you don't even care for your own legs so long as you can eat eat and sleep sleep you a horse indeed  but i tell you i was lame  i'm not denying there was a puffy look about your off-pastern but my belief is it wasn't even grease it was fat  i tell you i put my foot on one of those horrid stones they make the roads with and it gave my ankle such a twist  ankle indeed why should you ape your betters horses ain't got any ankles  they're only pasterns and so long as you don't lift your feet better but fall asleep between every step you'll run a good chance of laming all your ankles as you call them one after another it's not your lively horse that comes to grief in that way i tell you i believe it wasn't much and if it was it was your own fault there i've done i'm going to sleep i'll try to think as well of you as i can if you would but step out a bit and run off a little of your fat here diamond began to double up his knees but ruby spoke again and as young diamond thought in a rather different tone  i say diamond i can't bear to have an honest old horse like you think of me like that i will tell you the truth  it was my own fault that i fell lame  i told you so returned the other tumbling against the partition as he rolled over on his side to give his legs every possible privilege in their narrow circumstances  i meant to do it diamond  at the words the old horse arose with a scramble like thunder shot his angry head and glaring eye over into ruby's stall and said   keep out of my way you unworthy wretch or i'll bite you you a horse why did you do that  because i wanted to grow fat  you grease-tub oh my teeth and tail i thought you were a humbug why did you want to get fat there's no truth to be got out of you but by cross-questioning you ain't fit to be a horse  because once i am fat my nature is to keep fat for a long time and i didn't know when master might come home and want to see me  you conceited good-for-nothing brute you're only fit for the knacker's yard you wanted to look handsome did you hold your tongue or i'll break my halter and be at you with your handsome fat  never mind diamond you're a good horse you can't hurt me  can't hurt you just let me once try  no you can't  why then  because i'm an angel  what's that  of course you don't know  indeed i don't  i know you don't an ignorant rude old human horse like you couldn't know it but there's young diamond listening to all we're saying and he knows well enough there are horses in heaven for angels to ride upon as well as other animals lions and eagles and bulls in more important situations the horses the angels ride must be angel-horses else the angels couldn't ride upon them well i'm one of them  you ain't  did you ever know a horse tell a lie  never before but you've confessed to shamming lame  nothing of the sort it was necessary i should grow fat and necessary that good joseph your master should grow lean i could have pretended to be lame but that no horse least of all an angel-horse would do so i must be lame and so i sprained my ankle for the angel-horses have ankles they don't talk horse-slang up there and it hurt me very much i assure you diamond though you mayn't be good enough to be able to believe it  old diamond made no reply he had lain down again and a sleepy snort very like a snore revealed that if he was not already asleep he was past understanding a word that ruby was saying when young diamond found this he thought he might venture to take up the dropt shuttlecock of the conversation  i'm good enough to believe it ruby he said  but ruby never turned his head or took any notice of him i suppose he did not understand more of english than just what the coachman and stableman were in the habit of addressing him with finding however that his companion made no reply he shot his head over the partition and looking down at him said   you just wait till to-morrow and you'll see whether i'm speaking the truth or not i declare the old horse is fast asleep diamond no i won't  ruby turned away and began pulling at his hayrack in silence  diamond gave a shiver and looking round saw that the door of the stable was open he began to feel as if he had been dreaming and after a glance about the stable to see if north wind was anywhere visible he thought he had better go back to bed     chapter xxxiii the prospect brightens   the next morning diamond's mother said to his father i'm not quite comfortable about that child again  which child martha asked joseph you've got a choice now  well diamond i mean i'm afraid he's getting into his queer ways again he's been at his old trick of walking in his sleep i saw him run up the stair in the middle of the night  didn't you go after him wife  of course i did and found him fast asleep in his bed it's because he's had so little meat for the last six weeks i'm afraid  it may be that i'm very sorry but if it don't please god to send us enough what am i to do wife  you can't help it i know my dear good man returned martha and after all i don't know i don't see why he shouldn't get on as well as the rest of us there i'm nursing baby all this time and i get along pretty well i'm sure to hear the little man singing you wouldn't think there was much amiss with him  for at that moment diamond was singing like a lark in the clouds he had the new baby in his arms while his mother was dressing herself joseph was sitting at his breakfast a little weak tea dry bread and very dubious butter which nanny had set for him and which he was enjoying because he was hungry he had groomed both horses and had got old diamond harnessed ready to put to  think of a fat angel dulcimer said diamond  the baby had not been christened yet but diamond in reading his bible had come upon the word dulcimer and thought it so pretty that ever after he called his sister dulcimer  think of a red fat angel dulcimer he repeated for ruby's an angel of a horse dulcimer he sprained his ankle and got fat on purpose  what purpose diamond asked his father  ah that i can't tell i suppose to look handsome when his master comes answered diamond what do you think dulcimer it must be for some good for ruby's an angel  i wish i were rid of him anyhow said his father for he weighs heavy on my mind  no wonder father  he's so fat said diamond but you needn't be afraid for everybody says he's in better condition than when you had him  yes but he may be as thin as a tin horse before his owner comes it was too bad to leave him on my hands this way  perhaps he couldn't help it suggested diamond i daresay he has some good reason for it  so i should have said returned his father if he had not driven such a hard bargain with me at first  but we don't know what may come of it yet husband said his wife mr raymond may give a little to boot seeing you've had more of the bargain than you wanted or reckoned upon  i'm afraid not  he's a hard man said joseph as he rose and went to get his cab out  diamond resumed his singing for some time he carolled snatches of everything or anything but at last it settled down into something like what follows i cannot tell where or how he got it               where did you come from baby dear             out of the everywhere into here              where did you get your eyes so blue             out of the sky as i came through              what makes the light in them sparkle and spin             some of the starry spikes left in              where did you get that little tear             i found it waiting when i got here              what makes your forehead so smooth and high             a soft hand stroked it as i went by              what makes your cheek like a warm white rose             i saw something better than any one knows              whence that three-cornered smile of bliss             three angels gave me at once a kiss              where did you get this pearly ear             god spoke and it came out to hear              where did you get those arms and hands             love made itself into hooks and bands              feet whence did you come you darling things             from the same box as the cherubs' wings              how did they all just come to be you             god thought about me and so i grew              but how did you come to us you dear             god thought about you and so i am here  you never made that song diamond said his mother  no mother i wish i had no i don't that would be to take it from somebody else but it's mine for all that  what makes it yours  i love it so  does loving a thing make it yours  i think so mother at least more than anything else can if i didn't love baby which couldn't be you know she wouldn't be mine a bit but i do love baby and baby is my very own dulcimer  the baby's mine diamond  that makes her the more mine mother  how do you make that out  because you're mine mother  is that because you love me  yes just because love makes the only myness said diamond  when his father came home to have his dinner and change diamond for ruby they saw him look very sad and he told them he had not had a fare worth mentioning the whole morning  we shall all have to go to the workhouse wife he said  it would be better to go to the back of the north wind said diamond dreamily not intending to say it aloud  so it would answered his father but how are we to get there diamond  we must wait till we're taken returned diamond  before his father could speak again a knock came to the door and in walked mr raymond with a smile on his face joseph got up and received him respectfully but not very cordially martha set a chair for him but he would not sit down  you are not very glad to see me he said to joseph you don't want to part with the old horse  indeed sir you are mistaken there what with anxiety about him and bad luck i've wished i were rid of him a thousand times it was only to be for three months and here it's eight or nine  i'm sorry to hear such a statement said mr raymond hasn't he been of service to you  not much not with his lameness  ah said mr raymond hastily you've been laming him have you that accounts for it i see i see  it wasn't my fault and he's all right now i don't know how it happened but   he did it on purpose said diamond he put his foot on a stone just to twist his ankle  how do you know that diamond said his father turning to him i never said so for i could not think how it came  i heard it in the stable answered diamond  let's have a look at him said mr raymond  if you'll step into the yard said joseph i'll bring him out  they went and joseph having first taken off his harness walked ruby into the middle of the yard  why said mr raymond you've not been using him well  i don't know what you mean by that sir i didn't expect to hear that from you he's sound in wind and limb as sound as a barrel  and as big you might add why he's as fat as a pig you don't call that good usage  joseph was too angry to make any answer  you've not worked him enough i say that's not making good use of him that's not doing as you'd be done by  i shouldn't be sorry if i was served the same sir  he's too fat i say  there was a whole month i couldn't work him at all and he did nothing but eat his head off he's an awful eater i've taken the best part of six hours a day out of him since but i'm always afraid of his coming to grief again and so i couldn't make the most even of that i declare to you sir when he's between the shafts i sit on the box as miserable as if i'd stolen him he looks all the time as if he was a bottling up of complaints to make of me the minute he set eyes on you again there look at him now squinting round at me with one eye i declare to you on my word i haven't laid the whip on him more than three times  i'm glad to hear it he never did want the whip  i didn't say that sir if ever a horse wanted the whip he do he's brought me to beggary almost with his snail's pace i'm very glad you've come to rid me of him  i don't know that said mr raymond suppose i were to ask you to buy him of me cheap  i wouldn't have him in a present sir i don't like him and i wouldn't drive a horse that i didn't like no not for gold it can't come to good where there's no love between 'em  just bring out your own horse and let me see what sort of a pair they'd make  joseph laughed rather bitterly as he went to fetch diamond  when the two were placed side by side mr raymond could hardly keep his countenance but from a mingling of feelings beside the great red round barrel ruby all body and no legs diamond looked like a clothes-horse with a skin thrown over it there was hardly a spot of him where you could not descry some sign of a bone underneath gaunt and grim and weary he stood kissing his master and heeding no one else  you haven't been using him well said mr raymond  i must say returned joseph throwing an arm round his horse's neck that the remark had better have been spared sir the horse is worth three of the other now  i don't think so i think they make a very nice pair if the one's too fat the other's too lean so that's all right and if you won't buy my ruby i must buy your diamond  thank you sir said joseph in a tone implying anything but thanks  you don't seem to like the proposal said mr raymond  i don't returned joseph i wouldn't part with my old diamond for his skin as full of nuggets as it is of bones  who said anything about parting with him  you did now sir  no i didn't i only spoke of buying him to make a pair with ruby we could pare ruby and patch diamond a bit and for height they are as near a match as i care about of course you would be the coachman if only you would consent to be reconciled to ruby  joseph stood bewildered unable to answer  i've bought a small place in kent continued mr raymond and i must have a pair to my carriage for the roads are hilly thereabouts i don't want to make a show with a pair of high-steppers i think these will just do suppose for a week or two you set yourself to take ruby down and bring diamond up if we could only lay a pipe from ruby's sides into diamond's it would be the work of a moment but i fear that wouldn't answer  a strong inclination to laugh intruded upon joseph's inclination to cry and made speech still harder than before  i beg your pardon sir he said at length i've been so miserable and for so long that i never thought you was only a chaffing of me when you said i hadn't used the horses well i did grumble at you sir many's the time in my trouble but whenever i said anything my little diamond would look at me with a smile as much as to say  'i know him better than you father' and upon my word i always thought the boy must be right  will you sell me old diamond then  i will sir on one condition that if ever you want to part with him or me you give me the option of buying him i could not part with him sir as to who calls him his that's nothing for as diamond says it's only loving a thing that can make it yours and i do love old diamond sir dearly  well there's a cheque for twenty pounds which i wrote to offer you for him in case i should find you had done the handsome thing by ruby will that be enough  it's too much sir his body ain't worth it shoes and all it's only his heart sir that's worth millions but his heart'll be mine all the same so it's too much sir  i don't think so it won't be at least by the time we've got him fed up again you take it and welcome just go on with your cabbing for another month only take it out of ruby and let diamond rest and by that time i shall be ready for you to go down into the country  thank you sir thank you diamond set you down for a friend sir the moment he saw you i do believe that child of mine knows more than other people  i think so too said mr raymond as he walked away  he had meant to test joseph when he made the bargain about ruby but had no intention of so greatly prolonging the trial he had been taken ill in switzerland and had been quite unable to return sooner he went away now highly gratified at finding that he had stood the test and was a true man  joseph rushed in to his wife who had been standing at the window anxiously waiting the result of the long colloquy when she heard that the horses were to go together in double harness she burst forth into an immoderate fit of laughter diamond came up with the baby in his arms and made big anxious eyes at her saying   what is the matter with you mother dear do cry a little it will do you good when father takes ever so small a drop of spirits he puts water to it  you silly darling said his mother how could i but laugh at the notion of that great fat ruby going side by side with our poor old diamond  but why not mother with a month's oats and nothing to do diamond'll be nearer ruby's size than you will father's i think it's very good for different sorts to go together now ruby will have a chance of teaching diamond better manners  how dare you say such a thing diamond said his father angrily to compare the two for manners there's no comparison possible our diamond's a gentleman  i don't mean to say he isn't father for i daresay some gentlemen judge their neighbours unjustly that's all i mean diamond shouldn't have thought such bad things of ruby he didn't try to make the best of him  how do you know that pray  i heard them talking about it one night  who  why diamond and ruby ruby's an angel  joseph stared and said no more for all his new gladness he was very gloomy as he re-harnessed the angel for he thought his darling diamond was going out of his mind  he could not help thinking rather differently however when he found the change that had come over ruby considering his fat he exerted himself amazingly and got over the ground with incredible speed so willing even anxious was he to go now that joseph had to hold him quite tight  then as he laughed at his own fancies a new fear came upon him lest the horse should break his wind and mr raymond have good cause to think he had not been using him well he might even suppose that he had taken advantage of his new instructions to let out upon the horse some of his pent-up dislike whereas in truth it had so utterly vanished that he felt as if ruby too had been his friend all the time     chapter xxxiv in the country   before the end of the month ruby had got respectably thin and diamond respectably stout they really began to look fit for double harness  joseph and his wife got their affairs in order and everything ready for migrating at the shortest notice and they felt so peaceful and happy that they judged all the trouble they had gone through well worth enduring as for nanny she had been so happy ever since she left the hospital that she expected nothing better and saw nothing attractive in the notion of the country at the same time she had not the least idea of what the word country meant for she had never seen anything about her but streets and gas-lamps besides she was more attached to jim than to diamond  jim was a reasonable being diamond in her eyes at best only an amiable over-grown baby whom no amount of expostulation would ever bring to talk sense not to say think it now that she could manage the baby as well as he she judged herself altogether his superior towards his father and mother she was all they could wish  diamond had taken a great deal of pains and trouble to find jim and had at last succeeded through the help of the tall policeman who was glad to renew his acquaintance with the strange child jim had moved his quarters and had not heard of nanny's illness till some time after she was taken to the hospital where he was too shy to go and inquire about her but when at length she went to live with diamond's family jim was willing enough to go and see her it was after one of his visits during which they had been talking of her new prospects that nanny expressed to diamond her opinion of the country  there ain't nothing in it but the sun and moon diamond  there's trees and flowers said diamond  well they ain't no count returned nanny  ain't they they're so beautiful they make you happy to look at them  that's because you're such a silly  diamond smiled with a far-away look as if he were gazing through clouds of green leaves and the vision contented him but he was thinking with himself what more he could do for nanny and that same evening he went to find mr raymond for he had heard that he had returned to town  ah how do you do diamond said mr raymond i am glad to see you  and he was indeed for he had grown very fond of him his opinion of him was very different from nanny's  what do you want now my child he asked  i'm always wanting something sir answered diamond  well that's quite right so long as what you want is right everybody is always wanting something only we don't mention it in the right place often enough what is it now  there's a friend of nanny's a lame boy called jim  i've heard of him said mr raymond well  nanny doesn't care much about going to the country sir  well what has that to do with jim  you couldn't find a corner for jim to work in could you sir  i don't know that i couldn't that is if you can show good reason for it  he's a good boy sir  well so much the better for him  i know he can shine boots sir  so much the better for us  you want your boots shined in the country don't you sir  yes to be sure  it wouldn't be nice to walk over the flowers with dirty boots would it sir  no indeed  they wouldn't like it would they  no they wouldn't  then nanny would be better pleased to go sir  if the flowers didn't like dirty boots to walk over them nanny wouldn't mind going to the country is that it i don't quite see it  no sir i didn't mean that i meant if you would take jim with you to clean your boots and do odd jobs you know sir then nanny would like it better she's so fond of jim  now you come to the point diamond i see what you mean exactly i will turn it over in my mind could you bring jim to see me  i'll try sir but they don't mind me much they think i'm silly  added diamond with one of his sweetest smiles  what mr raymond thought i dare hardly attempt to put down here but one part of it was that the highest wisdom must ever appear folly to those who do not possess it  i think he would come though after dark you know diamond continued he does well at shining boots people's kind to lame boys you know sir but after dark there ain't so much doing  diamond succeeded in bringing jim to mr raymond and the consequence was that he resolved to give the boy a chance he provided new clothes for both him and nanny and upon a certain day joseph took his wife and three children and nanny and jim by train to a certain station in the county of kent where they found a cart waiting to carry them and their luggage to the mound which was the name of mr raymond's new residence i will not describe the varied feelings of the party as they went or when they arrived all i will say is that diamond who is my only care was full of quiet delight a gladness too deep to talk about  joseph returned to town the same night and the next morning drove ruby and diamond down with the carriage behind them and mr raymond and a lady in the carriage for mr raymond was an old bachelor no longer  he was bringing his wife with him to live at the mound the moment nanny saw her she recognised her as the lady who had lent her the ruby-ring that ring had been given her by mr raymond  the weather was very hot and the woods very shadowy there were not a great many wild flowers for it was getting well towards autumn and the most of the wild flowers rise early to be before the leaves because if they did not they would never get a glimpse of the sun for them so they have their fun over and are ready to go to bed again by the time the trees are dressed but there was plenty of the loveliest grass and daisies about the house and diamond's chief pleasure seemed to be to lie amongst them and breathe the pure air but all the time he was dreaming of the country at the back of the north wind and trying to recall the songs the river used to sing for this was more like being at the back of the north wind than anything he had known since he left it sometimes he would have his little brother sometimes his little sister and sometimes both of them in the grass with him and then he felt just like a cat with her first kittens he said only he couldn't purr all he could do was to sing  these were very different times from those when he used to drive the cab but you must not suppose that diamond was idle he did not do so much for his mother now because nanny occupied his former place but he helped his father still both in the stable and the harness-room and generally went with him on the box that he might learn to drive a pair and be ready to open the carriage-door mr raymond advised his father to give him plenty of liberty  a boy like that he said ought not to be pushed  joseph assented heartily smiling to himself at the idea of pushing diamond after doing everything that fell to his share the boy had a wealth of time at his disposal and a happy sometimes a merry time it was only for two months or so he neither saw nor heard anything of north wind     chapter xxxv i make diamond's acquaintance   mr raymond's house was called the mound because it stood upon a little steep knoll so smooth and symmetrical that it showed itself at once to be artificial it had beyond doubt been built for queen elizabeth as a hunting tower a place namely from the top of which you could see the country for miles on all sides and so be able to follow with your eyes the flying deer and the pursuing hounds and horsemen the mound had been cast up to give a good basement-advantage over the neighbouring heights and woods there was a great quarry-hole not far off brim-full of water from which as the current legend stated the materials forming the heart of the mound a kind of stone unfit for building had been dug the house itself was of brick and they said the foundations were first laid in the natural level and then the stones and earth of the mound were heaped about and between them so that its great height should be well buttressed  joseph and his wife lived in a little cottage a short way from the house it was a real cottage with a roof of thick thatch which in june and july the wind sprinkled with the red and white petals it shook from the loose topmost sprays of the rose-trees climbing the walls at first diamond had a nest under this thatch a pretty little room with white muslin curtains but afterwards mr and mrs raymond wanted to have him for a page in the house and his father and mother were quite pleased to have him employed without his leaving them so he was dressed in a suit of blue from which his pale face and fair hair came out like the loveliest blossom and took up his abode in the house  would you be afraid to sleep alone diamond asked his mistress  i don't know what you mean ma'am said diamond i never was afraid of anything that i can recollect not much at least  there's a little room at the top of the house all alone she returned perhaps you would not mind sleeping there  i can sleep anywhere and i like best to be high up should i be able to see out  i will show you the place she answered and taking him by the hand she led him up and up the oval-winding stair in one of the two towers  near the top they entered a tiny little room with two windows from which you could see over the whole country diamond clapped his hands with delight  you would like this room then diamond said his mistress  it's the grandest room in the house he answered i shall be near the stars and yet not far from the tops of the trees that's just what i like  i daresay he thought also that it would be a nice place for north wind to call at in passing but he said nothing of that sort below him spread a lake of green leaves with glimpses of grass here and there at the bottom of it as he looked down he saw a squirrel appear suddenly and as suddenly vanish amongst the topmost branches  aha little squirrel he cried my nest is built higher than yours  you can be up here with your books as much as you like said his mistress i will have a little bell hung at the door which i can ring when i want you half-way down the stair is the drawing-room  so diamond was installed as page and his new room got ready for him  it was very soon after this that i came to know diamond i was then a tutor in a family whose estate adjoined the little property belonging to the mound i had made the acquaintance of mr raymond in london some time before and was walking up the drive towards the house to call upon him one fine warm evening when i saw diamond for the first time he was sitting at the foot of a great beech-tree a few yards from the road with a book on his knees he did not see me i walked up behind the tree and peeping over his shoulder saw that he was reading a fairy-book  what are you reading i said and spoke suddenly with the hope of seeing a startled little face look round at me diamond turned his head as quietly as if he were only obeying his mother's voice and the calmness of his face rebuked my unkind desire and made me ashamed of it  i am reading the story of the little lady and the goblin prince said diamond  i am sorry i don't know the story i returned who is it by  mr raymond made it  is he your uncle i asked at a guess  no he's my master  what do you do for him i asked respectfully  anything he wishes me to do he answered i am busy for him now he gave me this story to read he wants my opinion upon it  don't you find it rather hard to make up your mind  oh dear no any story always tells me itself what i'm to think about it mr raymond doesn't want me to say whether it is a clever story or not but whether i like it and why i like it i never can tell what they call clever from what they call silly but i always know whether i like a story or not  and can you always tell why you like it or not  no very often i can't at all sometimes i can i always know but i can't always tell why mr raymond writes the stories and then tries them on me mother does the same when she makes jam she's made such a lot of jam since we came here and she always makes me taste it to see if it'll do mother knows by the face i make whether it will or not  at this moment i caught sight of two more children approaching one was a handsome girl the other a pale-faced awkward-looking boy who limped much on one leg i withdrew a little to see what would follow for they seemed in some consternation after a few hurried words they went off together and i pursued my way to the house where i was as kindly received by mr and mrs raymond as i could have desired from them i learned something of diamond and was in consequence the more glad to find him when i returned seated in the same place as before  what did the boy and girl want with you diamond i asked  they had seen a creature that frightened them  and they came to tell you about it  they couldn't get water out of the well for it so they wanted me to go with them  they're both bigger than you  yes but they were frightened at it  and weren't you frightened at it  no  why  because i'm silly i'm never frightened at things  i could not help thinking of the old meaning of the word silly  and what was it i asked  i think it was a kind of an angel a very little one it had a long body and great wings which it drove about it so fast that they grew a thin cloud all round it it flew backwards and forwards over the well or hung right in the middle making a mist of its wings as if its business was to take care of the water  and what did you do to drive it away  i didn't drive it away i knew whatever the creature was the well was to get water out of so i took the jug dipped it in and drew the water  and what did the creature do  flew about  and it didn't hurt you  no why should it i wasn't doing anything wrong  what did your companions say then  they said `thank you diamond what a dear silly you are'  and weren't you angry with them  no why should i i should like if they would play with me a little but they always like better to go away together when their work is over they never heed me i don't mind it much though the other creatures are friendly they don't run away from me only they're all so busy with their own work they don't mind me much  do you feel lonely then  oh no when nobody minds me i get into my nest and look up and then the sky does mind me and thinks about me  where is your nest  he rose saying i will show you and led me to the other side of the tree  there hung a little rope-ladder from one of the lower boughs the boy climbed up the ladder and got upon the bough then he climbed farther into the leafy branches and went out of sight  after a little while i heard his voice coming down out of the tree  i am in my nest now said the voice  i can't see you i returned  i can't see you either but i can see the first star peeping out of the sky i should like to get up into the sky don't you think i shall some day  yes i do tell me what more you see up there  i don't see anything more except a few leaves and the big sky over me it goes swinging about the earth is all behind my back there comes another star the wind is like kisses from a big lady when i get up here i feel as if i were in north wind's arms  this was the first i heard of north wind  the whole ways and look of the child so full of quiet wisdom yet so ready to accept the judgment of others in his own dispraise took hold of my heart and i felt myself wonderfully drawn towards him it seemed to me somehow as if little diamond possessed the secret of life and was himself what he was so ready to think the lowest living thing an angel of god with something special to say or do a gush of reverence came over me and with a single goodnight i turned and left him in his nest  i saw him often after this and gained so much of his confidence that he told me all i have told you i cannot pretend to account for it i leave that for each philosophical reader to do after his own fashion the easiest way is that of nanny and jim who said often to each other that diamond had a tile loose but mr raymond was much of my opinion concerning the boy while mrs raymond confessed that she often rang her bell just to have once more the pleasure of seeing the lovely stillness of the boy's face with those blue eyes which seemed rather made for other people to look into than for himself to look out of  it was plainer to others than to himself that he felt the desertion of nanny and jim they appeared to regard him as a mere toy except when they found he could minister to the scruple of using him generally with success they were however well-behaved to a wonderful degree while i have little doubt that much of their good behaviour was owing to the unconscious influence of the boy they called god's baby  one very strange thing is that i could never find out where he got some of his many songs at times they would be but bubbles blown out of a nursery rhyme as was the following which i heard him sing one evening to his little dulcimer there were about a score of sheep feeding in a paddock near him their white wool dyed a pale rose in the light of the setting sun those in the long shadows from the trees were dead white those in the sunlight were half glorified with pale rose            little bo peep she lost her sheep             and didn't know where to find them          they were over the height and out of sight             trailing their tails behind them           little bo peep woke out of her sleep             jump'd up and set out to find them           the silly things they've got no wings             and they've left their trails behind them      they've taken their tails but they've left their trails    and so i shall follow and find them     for wherever a tail had dragged a trail    the long grass grew behind them     and day's eyes and butter-cups cow's lips and crow's feet    were glittering in the sun    she threw down her book and caught up her crook    and after her sheep did run     she ran and she ran and ever as she ran    the grass grew higher and higher    till over the hill the sun began    to set in a flame of fire     she ran on still up the grassy hill    and the grass grew higher and higher    when she reached its crown the sun was down    and had left a trail of fire     the sheep and their tails were gone all gone     and no more trail behind them    yes yes  they were there long-tailed and fair    but alas  she could not find them     purple and gold and rosy and blue    with their tails all white behind them    her sheep they did run in the trail of the sun    she saw them but could not find them     after the sun like clouds they did run    but she knew they were her sheep     she sat down to cry and look up at the sky    but she cried herself asleep     and as she slept the dew fell fast    and the wind blew from the sky    and strange things took place that shun the day's face    because they are sweet and shy     nibble nibble crop  she heard as she woke     a hundred little lambs    did pluck and eat the grass so sweet    that grew in the trails of their dams     little bo peep caught up her crook    and wiped the tears that did blind her    and nibble nibble crop without a stop    the lambs came eating behind her     home home she came both tired and lame    with three times as many sheep    in a month or more they'll be as big as before    and then she'll laugh in her sleep     but what would you say if one fine day    when they've got their bushiest tails    their grown up game should be just the same    and she have to follow their trails     never weep bo peep though you lose your sheep    and do not know where to find them    'tis after the sun the mothers have run    and there are their lambs behind them  i confess again to having touched up a little but it loses far more in diamond's sweet voice singing it than it gains by a rhyme here and there  some of them were out of books mr raymond had given him these he always knew but about the others he could seldom tell sometimes he would say i made that one but generally he would say i don't know i found it somewhere or i got it at the back of the north wind  one evening i found him sitting on the grassy slope under the house with his dulcimer in his arms and his little brother rolling on the grass beside them he was chanting in his usual way more like the sound of a brook than anything else i can think of when i went up to them he ceased his chant  do go on diamond don't mind me i said  he began again at once while he sang nanny and jim sat a little way off one hemming a pocket-handkerchief and the other reading a story to her but they never heeded diamond this is as near what he sang as i can recollect or reproduce rather     what would you see if i took you up    to my little nest in the air    you would see the sky like a clear blue cup    turned upside downwards there     what would you do if i took you there    to my little nest in the tree    my child with cries would trouble the air    to get what she could but see     what would you get in the top of the tree    for all your crying and grief    not a star would you clutch of all you see     you could only gather a leaf     but when you had lost your greedy grief    content to see from afar    you would find in your hand a withering leaf    in your heart a shining star  as diamond went on singing it grew very dark and just as he ceased there came a great flash of lightning that blinded us all for a moment dulcimer crowed with pleasure but when the roar of thunder came after it the little brother gave a loud cry of terror nanny and jim came running up to us pale with fear diamond's face too was paler than usual but with delight some of the glory seemed to have clung to it and remained shining  you're not frightened are you diamond i said  no why should i be he answered with his usual question looking up in my face with calm shining eyes  he ain't got sense to be frightened said nanny going up to him and giving him a pitying hug  perhaps there's more sense in not being frightened nanny i returned do you think the lightning can do as it likes  it might kill you said jim  oh no it mightn't said diamond  as he spoke there came another great flash and a tearing crack  there's a tree struck i said and when we looked round after the blinding of the flash had left our eyes we saw a huge bough of the beech-tree in which was diamond's nest hanging to the ground like the broken wing of a bird  there cried nanny i told you so if you had been up there you see what would have happened you little silly  no i don't said diamond and began to sing to dulcimer all i could hear of the song for the other children were going on with their chatter was                        the clock struck one                      and the mouse came down                      dickery dickery dock  then there came a blast of wind and the rain followed in straight-pouring lines as if out of a watering-pot diamond jumped up with his little dulcimer in his arms and nanny caught up the little boy and they ran for the cottage jim vanished with a double shuffle and i went into the house  when i came out again to return home the clouds were gone and the evening sky glimmered through the trees blue and pale-green towards the west i turned my steps a little aside to look at the stricken beech i saw the bough torn from the stem and that was all the twilight would allow me to see while i stood gazing down from the sky came a sound of singing but the voice was neither of lark nor of nightingale  it was sweeter than either  it was the voice of diamond up in his airy nest                         the lightning and thunder                      they go and they come                      but the stars and the stillness                      are always at home  and then the voice ceased  good-night diamond i said  good-night sir answered diamond  as i walked away pondering i saw the great black top of the beech swaying about against the sky in an upper wind and heard the murmur as of many dim half-articulate voices filling the solitude around diamond's nest     chapter xxxvi diamond questions north wind   my readers will not wonder that after this i did my very best to gain the friendship of diamond nor did i find this at all difficult the child was so ready to trust upon one subject alone was he reticent the story of his relations with north wind i fancy he could not quite make up his mind what to think of them at all events it was some little time before he trusted me with this only then he told me everything if i could not regard it all in exactly the same light as he did i was while guiltless of the least pretence fully sympathetic and he was satisfied without demanding of me any theory of difficult points involved i let him see plainly enough that whatever might be the explanation of the marvellous experience i would have given much for a similar one myself  on an evening soon after the thunderstorm in a late twilight with a half-moon high in the heavens i came upon diamond in the act of climbing by his little ladder into the beech-tree  what are you always going up there for diamond i heard nanny ask rather rudely i thought  sometimes for one thing sometimes for another nanny answered diamond looking skywards as he climbed  you'll break your neck some day she said  i'm going up to look at the moon to-night he added without heeding her remark  you'll see the moon just as well down here she returned  i don't think so  you'll be no nearer to her up there  oh yes i shall i must be nearer her you know i wish i could dream as pretty dreams about her as you can nanny  you silly you never have done about that dream i never dreamed but that one and it was nonsense enough i'm sure  it wasn't nonsense it was a beautiful dream and a funny one too both in one  but what's the good of talking about it that way when you know it was only a dream dreams ain't true  that one was true nanny you know it was didn't you come to grief for doing what you were told not to do and isn't that true  i can't get any sense into him exclaimed nanny with an expression of mild despair do you really believe diamond that there's a house in the moon with a beautiful lady and a crooked old man and dusters in it  if there isn't there's something better he answered and vanished in the leaves over our heads  i went into the house where i visited often in the evenings when i came out there was a little wind blowing very pleasant after the heat of the day for although it was late summer now it was still hot the tree-tops were swinging about in it i took my way past the beech and called up to see if diamond were still in his nest in its rocking head  are you there diamond i said  yes sir came his clear voice in reply  isn't it growing too dark for you to get down safely  oh no sir if i take time to it i know my way so well and never let go with one hand till i've a good hold with the other  do be careful i insisted foolishly seeing the boy was as careful as he could be already  i'm coming he returned i've got all the moon i want to-night   i heard a rustling and a rustling drawing nearer and nearer three or four minutes elapsed and he appeared at length creeping down his little ladder i took him in my arms and set him on the ground  thank you sir he said that's the north wind blowing isn't it sir  i can't tell i answered it feels cool and kind and i think it may be but i couldn't be sure except it were stronger for a gentle wind might turn any way amongst the trunks of the trees  i shall know when i get up to my own room said diamond i think i hear my mistress's bell good-night sir  he ran to the house and i went home  his mistress had rung for him only to send him to bed for she was very careful over him and i daresay thought he was not looking well when he reached his own room he opened both his windows one of which looked to the north and the other to the east to find how the wind blew it blew right in at the northern window diamond was very glad for he thought perhaps north wind herself would come now  a real north wind had never blown all the time since he left london but as she always came of herself and never when he was looking for her and indeed almost never when he was thinking of her he shut the east window and went to bed perhaps some of my readers may wonder that he could go to sleep with such an expectation and indeed if i had not known him i should have wondered at it myself but it was one of his peculiarities and seemed nothing strange in him he was so full of quietness that he could go to sleep almost any time if he only composed himself and let the sleep come this time he went fast asleep as usual  but he woke in the dim blue night the moon had vanished he thought he heard a knocking at his door somebody wants me he said to himself and jumping out of bed ran to open it  but there was no one there he closed it again and the noise still continuing found that another door in the room was rattling it belonged to a closet he thought but he had never been able to open it the wind blowing in at the window must be shaking it he would go and see if it was so  the door now opened quite easily but to his surprise instead of a closet he found a long narrow room the moon which was sinking in the west shone in at an open window at the further end the room was low with a coved ceiling and occupied the whole top of the house immediately under the roof it was quite empty the yellow light of the half-moon streamed over the dark floor he was so delighted at the discovery of the strange desolate moonlit place close to his own snug little room that he began to dance and skip about the floor the wind came in through the door he had left open and blew about him as he danced and he kept turning towards it that it might blow in his face he kept picturing to himself the many places lovely and desolate the hill-sides and farm-yards and tree-tops and meadows over which it had blown on its way to the mound and as he danced he grew more and more delighted with the motion and the wind his feet grew stronger and his body lighter until at length it seemed as if he were borne up on the air and could almost fly so strong did his feeling become that at last he began to doubt whether he was not in one of those precious dreams he had so often had in which he floated about on the air at will but something made him look up and to his unspeakable delight he found his uplifted hands lying in those of north wind who was dancing with him round and round the long bare room her hair now falling to the floor now filling the arched ceiling her eyes shining on him like thinking stars and the sweetest of grand smiles playing breezily about her beautiful mouth she was as so often before of the height of a rather tall lady she did not stoop in order to dance with him but held his hands high in hers when he saw her he gave one spring and his arms were about her neck and her arms holding him to her bosom the same moment she swept with him through the open window in at which the moon was shining made a circuit like a bird about to alight and settled with him in his nest on the top of the great beech-tree there she placed him on her lap and began to hush him as if he were her own baby and diamond was so entirely happy that he did not care to speak a word at length however he found that he was going to sleep and that would be to lose so much that pleasant as it was he could not consent  please dear north wind he said i am so happy that i'm afraid it's a dream how am i to know that it's not a dream  what does it matter returned north wind  i should cry said diamond  but why should you cry the dream if it is a dream is a pleasant one is it not  that's just why i want it to be true  have you forgotten what you said to nanny about her dream  it's not for the dream itself i mean it's not for the pleasure of it answered diamond for i have that whether it be a dream or not it's for you north wind i can't bear to find it a dream because then i should lose you you would be nobody then and i could not bear that you ain't a dream are you dear north wind do say no else i shall cry and come awake and you'll be gone for ever i daren't dream about you once again if you ain't anybody  i'm either not a dream or there's something better that's not a dream diamond said north wind in a rather sorrowful tone he thought  but it's not something better it's you i want north wind he persisted already beginning to cry a little  she made no answer but rose with him in her arms and sailed away over the tree-tops till they came to a meadow where a flock of sheep was feeding  do you remember what the song you were singing a week ago says about bo-peep how she lost her sheep but got twice as many lambs asked north wind sitting down on the grass and placing him in her lap as before  oh yes i do well enough answered diamond but i never just quite liked that rhyme  why not child  because it seems to say one's as good as another or two new ones are better than one that's lost i've been thinking about it a great deal and it seems to me that although any one sixpence is as good as any other sixpence not twenty lambs would do instead of one sheep whose face you knew somehow when once you've looked into anybody's eyes right deep down into them i mean nobody will do for that one any more nobody ever so beautiful or so good will make up for that one going out of sight so you see north wind i can't help being frightened to think that perhaps i am only dreaming and you are nowhere at all do tell me that you are my own real beautiful north wind  again she rose and shot herself into the air as if uneasy because she could not answer him and diamond lay quiet in her arms waiting for what she would say he tried to see up into her face for he was dreadfully afraid she was not answering him because she could not say that she was not a dream but she had let her hair fall all over her face so that he could not see it this frightened him still more  do speak north wind he said at last  i never speak when i have nothing to say she replied  then i do think you must be a real north wind and no dream said diamond  but i'm looking for something to say all the time  but i don't want you to say what's hard to find if you were to say one word to comfort me that wasn't true then i should know you must be a dream for a great beautiful lady like you could never tell a lie  but she mightn't know how to say what she had to say so that a little boy like you would understand it said north wind here let us get down again and i will try to tell you what i think you musn't suppose i am able to answer all your questions though there are a great many things i don't understand more than you do  she descended on a grassy hillock in the midst of a wild furzy common there was a rabbit-warren underneath and some of the rabbits came out of their holes in the moonlight looking very sober and wise just like patriarchs standing in their tent-doors and looking about them before going to bed when they saw north wind instead of turning round and vanishing again with a thump of their heels they cantered slowly up to her and snuffled all about her with their long upper lips which moved every way at once that was their way of kissing her and as she talked to diamond she would every now and then stroke down their furry backs or lift and play with their long ears they would diamond thought have leaped upon her lap but that he was there already  i think said she after they had been sitting silent for a while that if i were only a dream you would not have been able to love me so you love me when you are not with me don't you  indeed i do answered diamond stroking her hand i see i see how could i be able to love you as i do if you weren't there at all you know besides i couldn't be able to dream anything half so beautiful all out of my own head or if i did i couldn't love a fancy of my own like that could i  i think not you might have loved me in a dream dreamily and forgotten me when you woke i daresay but not loved me like a real being as you love me even then i don't think you could dream anything that hadn't something real like it somewhere but you've seen me in many shapes diamond  you remember i was a wolf once don't you  oh yes a good wolf that frightened a naughty drunken nurse  well suppose i were to turn ugly would you rather i weren't a dream then  yes for i should know that you were beautiful inside all the same you would love me and i should love you all the same i shouldn't like you to look ugly you know but i shouldn't believe it a bit  not if you saw it  no not if i saw it ever so plain  there's my diamond i will tell you all i know about it then i don't think i am just what you fancy me to be i have to shape myself various ways to various people but the heart of me is true people call me by dreadful names and think they know all about me but they don't sometimes they call me bad fortune sometimes evil chance sometimes ruin and they have another name for me which they think the most dreadful of all  what is that asked diamond smiling up in her face  i won't tell you that name do you remember having to go through me to get into the country at my back  oh yes i do how cold you were north wind and so white all but your lovely eyes my heart grew like a lump of ice and then i forgot for a while  you were very near knowing what they call me then would you be afraid of me if you had to go through me again  no why should i indeed i should be glad enough if it was only to get another peep of the country at your back  you've never seen it yet  haven't i north wind oh i'm so sorry i thought i had what did i see then  only a picture of it the real country at my real back is ever so much more beautiful than that you shall see it one day perhaps before very long  do they sing songs there  don't you remember the dream you had about the little boys that dug for the stars  yes that i do i thought you must have had something to do with that dream it was so beautiful  yes i gave you that dream  oh thank you did you give nanny her dream too about the moon and the bees  yes i was the lady that sat at the window of the moon  oh thank you i was almost sure you had something to do with that too and did you tell mr raymond the story about the princess daylight  i believe i had something to do with it at all events he thought about it one night when he couldn't sleep but i want to ask you whether you remember the song the boy-angels sang in that dream of yours  no i couldn't keep it do what i would and i did try  that was my fault  how could that be north wind  because i didn't know it properly myself and so i couldn't teach it to you i could only make a rough guess at something like what it would be and so i wasn't able to make you dream it hard enough to remember it nor would i have done so if i could for it was not correct i made you dream pictures of it though but you will hear the very song itself when you do get to the back of    my own dear north wind said diamond finishing the sentence for her and kissing the arm that held him leaning against her  and now we've settled all this for the time at least said north wind  but i can't feel quite sure yet said diamond  you must wait a while for that meantime you may be hopeful and content not to be quite sure come now i will take you home again for it won't do to tire you too much  oh no no i'm not the least tired pleaded diamond  it is better though  very well if you wish it yielded diamond with a sigh  you are a dear good boy said north wind i will come for you again to-morrow night and take you out for a longer time we shall make a little journey together in fact we shall start earlier and as the moon will be later we shall have a little moonlight all the way  she rose and swept over the meadow and the trees in a few moments the mound appeared below them she sank a little and floated in at the window of diamond's room there she laid him on his bed covered him over and in a moment he was lapt in a dreamless sleep     chapter xxxvii once more   the next night diamond was seated by his open window with his head on his hand rather tired but so eagerly waiting for the promised visit that he was afraid he could not sleep but he started suddenly and found that he had been already asleep he rose and looking out of the window saw something white against his beech-tree it was north wind she was holding by one hand to a top branch her hair and her garments went floating away behind her over the tree whose top was swaying about while the others were still  are you ready diamond she asked  yes answered diamond quite ready  in a moment she was at the window and her arms came in and took him she sailed away so swiftly that he could at first mark nothing but the speed with which the clouds above and the dim earth below went rushing past but soon he began to see that the sky was very lovely with mottled clouds all about the moon on which she threw faint colours like those of mother-of-pearl or an opal the night was warm and in the lady's arms he did not feel the wind which down below was making waves in the ripe corn and ripples on the rivers and lakes at length they descended on the side of an open earthy hill just where from beneath a stone a spring came bubbling out  i am going to take you along this little brook said north wind i am not wanted for anything else to-night so i can give you a treat  she stooped over the stream and holding diamond down close to the surface of it glided along level with its flow as it ran down the hill and the song of the brook came up into diamond's ears and grew and grew and changed with every turn it seemed to diamond to be singing the story of its life to him and so it was it began with a musical tinkle which changed to a babble and then to a gentle rushing sometimes its song would almost cease and then break out again tinkle babble and rush all at once at the bottom of the hill they came to a small river into which the brook flowed with a muffled but merry sound along the surface of the river darkly clear below them in the moonlight they floated now where it widened out into a little lake they would hover for a moment over a bed of water-lilies and watch them swing about folded in sleep as the water on which they leaned swayed in the presence of north wind and now they would watch the fishes asleep among their roots below sometimes she would hold diamond over a deep hollow curving into the bank that he might look far into the cool stillness sometimes she would leave the river and sweep across a clover-field the bees were all at home and the clover was asleep then she would return and follow the river it grew wider and wider as it went now the armies of wheat and of oats would hang over its rush from the opposite banks now the willows would dip low branches in its still waters and now it would lead them through stately trees and grassy banks into a lovely garden where the roses and lilies were asleep the tender flowers quite folded up and only a few wide-awake and sending out their life in sweet strong odours wider and wider grew the stream until they came upon boats lying along its banks which rocked a little in the flutter of north wind's garments then came houses on the banks each standing in a lovely lawn with grand trees and in parts the river was so high that some of the grass and the roots of some of the trees were under water and diamond as they glided through between the stems could see the grass at the bottom of the water then they would leave the river and float about and over the houses one after another beautiful rich houses which like fine trees had taken centuries to grow there was scarcely a light to be seen and not a movement to be heard  all the people in them lay fast asleep  what a lot of dreams they must be dreaming said diamond  yes returned north wind they can't surely be all lies can they  i should think it depends a little on who dreams them suggested diamond  yes said north wind the people who think lies and do lies are very likely to dream lies but the people who love what is true will surely now and then dream true things but then something depends on whether the dreams are home-grown or whether the seed of them is blown over somebody else's garden-wall ah there's some one awake in this house  they were floating past a window in which a light was burning diamond heard a moan and looked up anxiously in north wind's face  it's a lady said north wind she can't sleep for pain  couldn't you do something for her said diamond  no i can't but you could  what could i do  sing a little song to her  she wouldn't hear me  i will take you in and then she will hear you  but that would be rude wouldn't it you can go where you please of course but i should have no business in her room  you may trust me diamond i shall take as good care of the lady as of you the window is open come  by a shaded lamp a lady was seated in a white wrapper trying to read but moaning every minute north wind floated behind her chair set diamond down and told him to sing something he was a little frightened but he thought a while and then sang               the sun is gone down            and the moon's in the sky            but the sun will come up            and the moon be laid by             the flower is asleep            but it is not dead            when the morning shines            it will lift its head             when winter comes            it will die no no            it will only hide            from the frost and the snow             sure is the summer            sure is the sun            the night and the winter            are shadows that run  the lady never lifted her eyes from her book or her head from her hand  as soon as diamond had finished north wind lifted him and carried him away  didn't the lady hear me asked diamond when they were once more floating down the river  oh yes she heard you answered north wind  was she frightened then  oh no  why didn't she look to see who it was  she didn't know you were there  how could she hear me then  she didn't hear you with her ears  what did she hear me with  with her heart  where did she think the words came from  she thought they came out of the book she was reading she will search all through it to-morrow to find them and won't be able to understand it at all  oh what fun said diamond what will she do  i can tell you what she won't do  she'll never forget the meaning of them and she'll never be able to remember the words of them  if she sees them in mr raymond's book it will puzzle her won't it  yes that it will she will never be able to understand it  until she gets to the back of the north wind suggested diamond  until she gets to the back of the north wind assented the lady  oh cried diamond i know now where we are oh do let me go into the old garden and into mother's room and diamond's stall i wonder if the hole is at the back of my bed still i should like to stay there all the rest of the night it won't take you long to get home from here will it north wind  no she answered you shall stay as long as you like  oh how jolly cried diamond as north wind sailed over the house with him and set him down on the lawn at the back  diamond ran about the lawn for a little while in the moonlight he found part of it cut up into flower-beds and the little summer-house with the coloured glass and the great elm-tree gone he did not like this and ran into the stable there were no horses there at all he ran upstairs the rooms were empty the only thing left that he cared about was the hole in the wall where his little bed had stood and that was not enough to make him wish to stop he ran down the stair again and out upon the lawn there he threw himself down and began to cry it was all so dreary and lost  i thought i liked the place so much said diamond to himself but i find i don't care about it i suppose it's only the people in it that make you like a place and when they're gone it's dead and you don't care a bit about it north wind told me i might stop as long as i liked and i've stopped longer already north wind he cried aloud turning his face towards the sky  the moon was under a cloud and all was looking dull and dismal a star shot from the sky and fell in the grass beside him the moment it lighted there stood north wind  oh cried diamond joyfully were you the shooting star  yes my child  did you hear me call you then  yes  so high up as that  yes i heard you quite well  do take me home  have you had enough of your old home already  yes more than enough it isn't a home at all now  i thought that would be it said north wind everything dreaming and all has got a soul in it or else it's worth nothing and we don't care a bit about it some of our thoughts are worth nothing because they've got no soul in them the brain puts them into the mind not the mind into the brain  but how can you know about that north wind you haven't got a body  if i hadn't you wouldn't know anything about me no creature can know another without the help of a body but i don't care to talk about that it is time for you to go home  so saying north wind lifted diamond and bore him away     chapter xxxviii at the back of the north wind   i did not see diamond for a week or so after this and then he told me what i have now told you i should have been astonished at his being able even to report such conversations as he said he had had with north wind had i not known already that some children are profound in metaphysics but a fear crosses me lest by telling so much about my friend i should lead people to mistake him for one of those consequential priggish little monsters who are always trying to say clever things and looking to see whether people appreciate them when a child like that dies instead of having a silly book written about him he should be stuffed like one of those awful big-headed fishes you see in museums but diamond never troubled his head about what people thought of him he never set up for knowing better than others the wisest things he said came out when he wanted one to help him with some difficulty he was in he was not even offended with nanny and jim for calling him a silly he supposed there was something in it though he could not quite understand what i suspect however that the other name they gave him god's baby had some share in reconciling him to it  happily for me i was as much interested in metaphysics as diamond himself and therefore while he recounted his conversations with north wind i did not find myself at all in a strange sea although certainly i could not always feel the bottom being indeed convinced that the bottom was miles away  could it be all dreaming do you think sir he asked anxiously  i daren't say diamond i answered but at least there is one thing you may be sure of that there is a still better love than that of the wonderful being you call north wind even if she be a dream the dream of such a beautiful creature could not come to you by chance  yes i know returned diamond i know  then he was silent but i confess appeared more thoughtful than satisfied  the next time i saw him he looked paler than usual  have you seen your friend again i asked him  yes he answered solemnly  did she take you out with her  no she did not speak to me i woke all at once as i generally do when i am going to see her and there she was against the door into the big room sitting just as i saw her sit on her own doorstep as white as snow and her eyes as blue as the heart of an iceberg she looked at me but never moved or spoke  weren't you afraid i asked  no why should i have been he answered i only felt a little cold  did she stay long  i don't know i fell asleep again i think i have been rather cold ever since though he added with a smile  i did not quite like this but i said nothing  four days after i called again at the mound the maid who opened the door looked grave but i suspected nothing when i reached the drawing-room i saw mrs raymond had been crying  haven't you heard she said seeing my questioning looks  i've heard nothing i answered  this morning we found our dear little diamond lying on the floor of the big attic-room just outside his own door fast asleep as we thought but when we took him up we did not think he was asleep we saw that    here the kind-hearted lady broke out crying afresh  may i go and see him i asked  yes she sobbed you know your way to the top of the tower  i walked up the winding stair and entered his room a lovely figure as white and almost as clear as alabaster was lying on the bed i saw at once how it was they thought he was dead i knew that he had gone to the back of the north wind"@"At the Back of the North Wind"@"George MacDonald"
"the light princess   contents     1  what no children    2  won't i just    3  she can't be ours    4  where is she    5  what is to be done    6  she laughs too much    7  try metaphysics    8  try a drop of water    9  put me in again   10  look at the moon   11  hiss   12  where is the prince   13  here i am   14  this is very kind of you   15  look at the rain     1  what no children   once upon a time so long ago that i have quite forgotten the date there lived a king and queen who had no children  and the king said to himself all the queens of my acquaintance have children some three some seven and some as many as twelve and my queen has not one  i feel ill-used  so he made up his mind to be cross with his wife about it  but she bore it all like a good patient queen as she was  then the king grew very cross indeed  but the queen pretended to take it all as a joke and a very good one too  why don't you have any daughters at least said he  i don't say sons that might be too much to expect  i am sure dear king i am very sorry said the queen  so you ought to be retorted the king you are not going to make a virtue of that surely  but he was not an ill-tempered king and in any matter of less moment would have let the queen have her own way with all his heart  this however was an affair of state  the queen smiled  you must have patience with a lady you know dear king said she  she was indeed a very nice queen and heartily sorry that she could not oblige the king immediately    2  won't i just  the king tried to have patience but he succeeded very badly  it was more than he deserved therefore when at last the queen gave him a daughter as lovely a little princess as ever cried  the day drew near when the infant must be christened  the king wrote all the invitations with his own hand  of course somebody was forgotten  now it does not generally matter if somebody is forgotten only you must mind who  unfortunately the king forgot without intending to forget and so the chance fell upon the princess makemnoit which was awkward  for the princess was the king's own sister and he ought not to have forgotten her  but she had made herself so disagreeable to the old king their father that he had forgotten her in making his will and so it was no wonder that her brother forgot her in writing his invitations  but poor relations don't do anything to keep you in mind of them  why don't they  the king could not see into the garret she lived in could he  she was a sour spiteful creature  the wrinkles of contempt crossed the wrinkles of peevishness and made her face as full of wrinkles as a pat of butter  if ever a king could be justified in forgetting anybody this king was justified in forgetting his sister even at a christening  she looked very odd too  her forehead was as large as all the rest of her face and projected over it like a precipice  when she was angry her little eyes flashed blue  when she hated anybody they shone yellow and green  what they looked like when she loved anybody i do not know for i never heard of her loving anybody but herself and i do not think she could have managed that if she had not somehow got used to herself  but what made it highly imprudent in the king to forget her was that she was awfully clever  in fact she was a witch and when she bewitched anybody he very soon had enough of it for she beat all the wicked fairies in wickedness and all the clever ones in cleverness  she despised all the modes we read of in history in which offended fairies and witches have taken their revenges and therefore after waiting and waiting in vain for an invitation she made up her mind at last to go without one and make the whole family miserable like a princess as she was  so she put on her best gown went to the palace was kindly received by the happy monarch who forgot that he had forgotten her and took her place in the procession to the royal chapel  when they were all gathered about the font she contrived to get next to it and throw something into the water after which she maintained a very respectful demeanour till the water was applied to the child's face  but at that moment she turned round in her place three times and muttered the following words loud enough for those beside her to hear      light of spirit by my charms   light of body every part   never weary human arms    only crush thy parents' heart   they all thought she had lost her wits and was repeating some foolish nursery rhyme but a shudder went through the whole of them notwithstanding  the baby on the contrary began to laugh and crow while the nurse gave a start and a smothered cry for she thought she was struck with paralysis  she could not feel the baby in her arms but she clasped it tight and said nothing  the mischief was done    3  she can't be ours  her atrocious aunt had deprived the child of all her gravity  if you ask me how this was effected i answer in the easiest way in the world  she had only to destroy gravitation  for the princess was a philosopher and knew all the ins and outs of the laws of gravitation as well as the ins and outs of her boot-lace  and being a witch as well she could abrogate those laws in a moment or at least so clog their wheels and rust their bearings that they would not work at all but we have more to do with what followed than with how it was done  the first awkwardness that resulted from this unhappy privation was that the moment the nurse began to float the baby up and down she flew from her arms towards the ceiling  happily the resistance of the air brought her ascending career to a close within a foot of it  there she remained horizontal as when she left her nurse's arms kicking and laughing amazingly  the nurse in terror flew to the bell and begged the footman who answered it to bring up the house-steps directly trembling in every limb she climbed upon the steps and had to stand upon the very top and reach up before she could catch the floating tail of the baby's long clothes  when the strange fact came to be known there was a terrible commotion in the palace  the occasion of its discovery by the king was naturally a repetition of the nurse's experience  astonished that he felt no weight when the child was laid in his arms he began to wave her up and not down for she slowly ascended to the ceiling as before and there remained floating in perfect comfort and satisfaction as was testified by her peals of tiny laughter  the king stood staring up in speechless amazement and trembled so that his beard shook like grass in the wind at last turning to the queen who was just as horror-struck as himself he said gasping staring and stammering   she can't be ours queen  now the queen was much cleverer than the king and had begun already to suspect that this effect defective came by cause  i am sure she is ours answered she  but we ought to have taken better care of her at the christening  people who were never invited ought not to have been present  oh ho said the king tapping his forehead with his forefinger i have it all  i've found her out  don't you see it queen  princess makemnoit has bewitched her that's just what i say answered the queen  i beg your pardon my love i did not hear you john bring the steps i get on my throne with  for he was a little king with a great throne like many other kings  the throne-steps were brought and set upon the dining-table and john got upon the top of them  but he could not reach the little princess who lay like a baby-laughter-cloud in the air exploding continuously take the tongs john said his majesty and getting up on the table he handed them to him  john could reach the baby now and the little princess was handed down by the tongs    4  where is she  one fine summer day a month after these her first adventures during which time she had been very carefully watched the princess was lying on the bed in the queen's own chamber fast asleep  one of the windows was open for it was noon and the day was so sultry that the little girl was wrapped in nothing less ethereal than slumber itself  the queen came into the room and not observing that the baby was on the bed opened another window  a frolicsome fairy wind which had been watching for a chance of mischief rushed in at the one window and taking its way over the bed where the child was lying caught her up and rolling and floating her along like a piece of flue or a dandelion seed carried her with it through the opposite window and away  the queen went down-stairs quite ignorant of the loss she had herself occasioned  when the nurse returned she supposed that her majesty had carried her off and dreading a scolding delayed making inquiry about her  but hearing nothing she grew uneasy and went at length to the queen's boudoir where she found her majesty  please your majesty shall i take the baby said she  where is she asked the queen  please forgive me  i know it was wrong  what do you mean said the queen looking grave  oh don't frighten me your majesty exclaimed the nurse clasping her hands  the queen saw that something was amiss and fell down in a faint  the nurse rushed about the palace screaming my baby my baby  every one ran to the queen's room  but the queen could give no orders they soon found out however that the princess was missing and in a moment the palace was like a beehive in a garden and in one minute more the queen was brought to herself by a great shout and a clapping of hands  they had found the princess fast asleep under a rose-bush to which the elvish little wind-puff had carried her finishing its mischief by shaking a shower of red rose-leaves all over the little white sleeper  startled by the noise the servants made she woke and furious with glee scattered the rose-leaves in all directions like a shower of spray in the sunset  she was watched more carefully after this no doubt yet it would be endless to relate all the odd incidents resulting from this peculiarity of the young princess  but there never was a baby in a house not to say a palace that kept the household in such constant good humour at least below-stairs  if it was not easy for her nurses to hold her at least she made neither their arms nor their hearts ache  and she was so nice to play at ball with  there was positively no danger of letting her fall  they might throw her down or knock her down or push her down but couldn't let her down  it is true they might let her fly into the fire or the coal-hole or through the window but none of these accidents had happened as yet  if you heard peals of laughter resounding from some unknown region you might be sure enough of the cause  going down into the kitchen or the room you would find jane and thomas and robert and susan all and sum playing at ball with the little princess  she was the ball herself and did not enjoy it the less for that  away she went flying from one to another screeching with laughter  and the servants loved the ball itself better even than the game  but they had to take some care how they threw her for if she received an upward direction she would never come down again without being fetched    5  what is to be done  but above-stairs it was different  one day for instance after breakfast the king went into his counting-house and counted out his money  the operation gave him no pleasure  to think said he to himself that every one of these gold sovereigns weighs a quarter of an ounce and my real live flesh-and-blood princess weighs nothing at all  and he hated his gold sovereigns as they lay with a broad smile of self-satisfaction all over their yellow faces  the queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey  but at the second mouthful she burst out crying and could not swallow it  the king heard her sobbing  glad of anybody but especially of his queen to quarrel with he clashed his gold sovereigns into his money-box clapped his crown on his head and rushed into the parlour  what is all this about exclaimed he  what are you crying for queen  i can't eat it said the queen looking ruefully at the honey-pot  no wonder retorted the king  you've just eaten your breakfast two turkey eggs and three anchovies  oh that's not it sobbed her majesty  it's my child my child  well what's the matter with your child  she's neither up the chimney nor down the draw-well  just hear her laughing  yet the king could not help a sigh which he tried to turn into a cough saying   it is a good thing to be light-hearted i am sure whether she be ours or not  it is a bad thing to be light-headed answered the queen looking with prophetic soul far into the future  'tis a good thing to be light-handed said the king  'tis a bad thing to be light-fingered answered the queen  'tis a good thing to be light-footed said the king  'tis a bad thing  began the queen but the king interrupted her  in fact said he with the tone of one who concludes an argument in which he has had only imaginary opponents and in which therefore he has come off triumphant in fact it is a good thing altogether to be light-bodied  but it is a bad thing altogether to be light-minded retorted the queen who was beginning to lose her temper  this last answer quite discomfited his majesty who turned on his heel and betook himself to his counting-house again  but he was not half-way towards it when the voice of his queen overtook him  and it's a bad thing to be light-haired screamed she determined to have more last words now that her spirit was roused  the queen's hair was black as night and the king's had been and his daughter's was golden as morning  but it was not this reflection on his hair that arrested him it was the double use of the word light for the king hated all witticisms and punning especially  and besides he could not tell whether the queen meant light-haired or light-heired for why might she not aspirate her vowels when she was exasperated herself  he turned upon his other heel and rejoined her  she looked angry still because she knew that she was guilty or what was much the same knew that he thought so  my dear queen said he duplicity of any sort is exceedingly objectionable between married people of any rank not to say kings and queens and the most objectionable form duplicity can assume is that of punning  there said the queen i never made a jest but i broke it in the making  i am the most unfortunate woman in the world  she looked so rueful that the king took her in his arms and they sat down to consult  can you bear this said the king  no i can't said the queen  well what's to be done said the king  i'm sure i don't know said the queen  but might you not try an apology  to my old sister i suppose you mean said the king  yes said the queen  well i don't mind said the king  so he went the next morning to the house of the princess and making a very humble apology begged her to undo the spell  but the princess declared with a grave face that she knew nothing at all about it her eyes however shone pink which was a sign that she was happy she advised the king and queen to have patience and to mend their ways  the king returned disconsolate  the queen tried to comfort him  we will wait till she is older  she may then be able to suggest something herself  she will know at least how she feels and explain things to us  but what if she should marry exclaimed the king in sudden consternation at the idea  well what of that rejoined the queen  just think  if she were to have children  in the course of a hundred years the air might be as full of floating children as of gossamers in autumn  that is no business of ours replied the queen  besides by that time they will have learned to take care of themselves  a sigh was the king's only answer  he would have consulted the court physicians but he was afraid they would try experiments upon her    6  she laughs too much  meantime notwithstanding awkward occurrences and griefs that she brought upon her parents the little princess laughed and grew not fat but plump and tall  she reached the age of seventeen without having fallen into any worse scrape than a chimney by rescuing her from which a little bird-nesting urchin got fame and a black face nor thoughtless as she was had she committed anything worse than laughter at everybody and everything that came in her way  when she was told for the sake of experiment that general clanrunfort was cut to pieces with all his troops she laughed when she heard that the enemy was on his way to besiege her papa's capital she laughed hugely but when she was told that the city would certainly be abandoned to the mercy of the enemy's soldiery why then she laughed immoderately  she never could be brought to see the serious side of anything  when her mother cried she said   what queer faces mamma makes  and she squeezes water out of her cheeks  funny mamma  and when her papa stormed at her she laughed and danced round and round him clapping her hands and crying   do it again papa  do it again  it's such fun  dear funny papa  and if he tried to catch her she glided from him in an instant not in the least afraid of him but thinking it part of the game not to be caught  with one push of her foot she would be floating in the air above his head or she would go dancing backwards and forwards and sideways like a great butterfly  it happened several times when her father and mother were holding a consultation about her in private that they were interrupted by vainly repressed outbursts of laughter over their heads and looking up with indignation saw her floating at full length in the air above them whence she regarded them with the most comical appreciation of the position  one day an awkward accident happened  the princess had come out upon the lawn with one of her attendants who held her by the hand  spying her father at the other side of the lawn she snatched her hand from the maid's and sped across to him  now when she wanted to run alone her custom was to catch up a stone in each hand so that she might come down again after a bound  whatever she wore as part of her attire had no effect in this way  even gold when it thus became as it were a part of herself lost all its weight for the time  but whatever she only held in her hands retained its downward tendency  on this occasion she could see nothing to catch up but a huge toad that was walking across the lawn as if he had a hundred years to do it in  not knowing what disgust meant for this was one of her peculiarities she snatched up the toad and bounded away  she had almost reached her father and he was holding out his arms to receive her and take from her lips the kiss which hovered on them like a butterfly on a rosebud when a puff of wind blew her aside into the arms of a young page who had just been receiving a message from his majesty  now it was no great peculiarity in the princess that once she was set agoing it always cost her time and trouble to check herself  on this occasion there was no time  she must kiss-and she kissed the page  she did not mind it much for she had no shyness in her composition and she knew besides that she could not help it  so she only laughed like a musical box  the poor page fared the worst  for the princess trying to correct the unfortunate tendency of the kiss put out her hands to keep her off the page so that along with the kiss he received on the other cheek a slap with the huge black toad which she poked right into his eye  he tried to laugh too but the attempt resulted in such an odd contortion of countenance as showed that there was no danger of his pluming himself on the kiss  as for the king his dignity was greatly hurt and he did not speak to the page for a whole month  i may here remark that it was very amusing to see her run if her mode of progression could properly be called running  for first she would make a bound then having alighted she would run a few steps and make another bound  sometimes she would fancy she had reached the ground before she actually had and her feet would go backwards and forwards running upon nothing at all like those of a chicken on its back  then she would laugh like the very spirit of fun only in her laugh there was something missing  what it was i find myself unable to describe  i think it was a certain tone depending upon the possibility of sorrow morbidezza perhaps  she never smiled    7  try metaphysics  after a long avoidance of the painful subject the king and queen resolved to hold a council of three upon it and so they sent for the princess  in she came sliding and flitting and gliding from one piece of furniture to another and put herself at last in an armchair in a sitting posture  whether she could be said to sit seeing she received no support from the seat of the chair i do not pretend to determine  my dear child said the king you must be aware by this time that you are not exactly like other people  oh you dear funny papa  i have got a nose and two eyes and all the rest  so have you  so has mamma  now be serious my dear for once said the queen  no thank you mamma i had rather not  would you not like to be able to walk like other people said the king  no indeed i should think not  you only crawl  you are such slow coaches  how do you feel my child he resumed after a pause of discomfiture  quite well thank you  i mean what do you feel like  like nothing at all that i know of  you must feel like something  i feel like a princess with such a funny papa and such a dear pet of a queen-mamma  now really began the queen but the princess interrupted her  oh yes she added i remember  i have a curious feeling sometimes as if i were the only person that had any sense in the whole world  she had been trying to behave herself with dignity but now she burst into a violent fit of laughter threw herself backwards over the chair and went rolling about the floor in an ecstasy of enjoyment  the king picked her up easier than one does a down quilt and replaced her in her former relation to the chair  the exact preposition expressing this relation i do not happen to know  is there nothing you wish for resumed the king who had learned by this time that it was useless to be angry with her  oh you dear papa yes answered she  what is it my darling  i have been longing for it oh such a time ever since last night tell me what it is  will you promise to let me have it  the king was on the point of saying yes but the wiser queen checked him with a single motion of her head  tell me what it is first said he  no no  promise first  i dare not  what is it  mind i hold you to your promise it is to be tied to the end of a string a very long string indeed and be flown like a kite  oh such fun  i would rain rose-water and hail sugar-plums and snow whipped-cream and and and   a fit of laughing checked her and she would have been off again over the floor had not the king started up and caught her just in time seeing nothing but talk could be got out of her he rang the bell and sent her away with two of her ladies-in-waiting  now queen he said turning to her majesty what is to be done  there is but one thing left answered she  let us consult the college of metaphysicians  bravo cried the king we will  now at the head of this college were two very wise chinese philosophers-by name hum-drum and kopy-keck  for them the king sent and straightway they came  in a long speech he communicated to them what they knew very well already as who did not namely the peculiar condition of his daughter in relation to the globe on which she dwelt and requested them to consult together as to what might be the cause and probable cure of her infirmity  the king laid stress upon the word but failed to discover his own pun  the queen laughed but hum-drum and kopy-keck heard with humility and retired in silence  the consultation consisted chiefly in propounding and supporting for the thousandth time each his favourite theories  for the condition of the princess afforded delightful scope for the discussion of every question arising from the division of thought-in fact of all the metaphysics of the chinese empire  but it is only justice to say that they did not altogether neglect the discussion of the practical question what was to be done  hum-drum was a materialist and kopy-keck was a spiritualist  the former was slow and sententious the latter was quick and flighty  the latter had generally the first word the former the last  i reassert my former assertion began kopy-keck with a plunge there is not a fault in the princess body or soul only they are wrong put together  listen to me now hum-drum and i will tell you in brief what i think  don't speak  don't answer me  i won't hear you till i have done   at that decisive moment when souls seek their appointed habitations two eager souls met struck rebounded lost their way and arrived each at the wrong place  the soul of the princess was one of those and she went far astray  she does not belong by rights to this world at all but to some other planet probably mercury  her proclivity to her true sphere destroys all the natural influence which this orb would otherwise possess over her corporeal frame  she cares for nothing here  there is no relation between her and this world  she must therefore be taught by the sternest compulsion to take an interest in the earth as the earth  she must study every department of its history its animal history its vegetable history its mineral history its social history its moral history its political history its scientific history its literary history its musical history its artistical history above all its metaphysical history  she must begin with the chinese dynasty and end with japan  but first of all she must study geology and especially the history of the extinct races of animals-their natures their habits their loves their hates their revenges  she must   hold h-o-o-old roared hum-drum  it is certainly my turn now  my rooted and insubvertible conviction is that the causes of the anomalies evident in the princess's condition are strictly and solely physical  but that is only tantamount to acknowledging that they exist  hear my opinion   from some cause or other of no importance to our inquiry the motion of her heart has been reversed  that remarkable combination of the suction and the force-pump works the wrong way-i mean in the case of the unfortunate princess  it draws in where it should force out and forces out where it should draw in  the offices of the auricles and the ventricles are subverted  the blood is sent forth by the veins and returns by the arteries  consequently it is running the wrong way through all her corporeal organism lungs and all  is it then at all mysterious seeing that such is the case that on the other particular of gravitation as well she should differ from normal humanity  my proposal for the cure is this    phlebotomize until she is reduced to the last point of safety  let it be effected if necessary in a warm bath  when she is reduced to a state of perfect asphyxy apply a ligature to the left ankle drawing it as tight as the bone will bear  apply at the same moment another of equal tension around the right wrist  by means of plates constructed for the purpose place the other foot and hand under the receivers of two air-pumps  exhaust the receivers  exhibit a pint of french brandy and await the result  which would presently arrive in the form of grim death said kopy-keck  if it should she would yet die in doing our duty retorted hum-drum  but their majesties had too much tenderness for their volatile offspring to subject her to either of the schemes of the equally unscrupulous philosophers  indeed the most complete knowledge of the laws of nature would have been unserviceable in her case for it was impossible to classify her  she was a fifth imponderable body sharing all the other properties of the ponderable    8  try a drop of water  perhaps the best thing for the princess would have been to fall in love  but how a princess who had no gravity could fall into anything is a difficulty perhaps the difficulty  as for her own feelings on the subject she did not even know that there was such a beehive of honey and stings to be fallen into  but now i come to mention another curious fact about her  the palace was built on the shores of the loveliest lake in the world and the princess loved this lake more than father or mother  the root of this preference no doubt although the princess did not recognise it as such was that the moment she got into it she recovered the natural right of which she had been so wickedly deprived namely gravity  whether this was owing to the fact that water had been employed as the means of conveying the injury i do not know  but it is certain that she could swim and dive like the duck that her old nurse said she was  the manner in which this alleviation of her misfortune was discovered was as follows  one summer evening during the carnival of the country she had been taken upon the lake by the king and queen in the royal barge  they were accompanied by many of the courtiers in a fleet of little boats in the middle of the lake she wanted to get into the lord chancellor's barge for his daughter who was a great favourite with her was in it with her father  now though the old king rarely condescended to make light of his misfortune yet happening on this occasion to be in a particularly good humour as the barges approached each other he caught up the princess to throw her into the chancellor's barge  he lost his balance however and dropping into the bottom of the barge lost his hold of his daughter not however before imparting to her the downward tendency of his own person though in a somewhat different direction for as the king fell into the boat she fell into the water  with a burst of delighted laughter she disappeared in the lake a cry of horror ascended from the boats  they had never seen the princess go down before  half the men were under water in a moment but they had all one after another come up to the surface again for breath when tinkle tinkle babble and gush came the princess's laugh over the water from far away  there she was swimming like a swan  nor would she come out for king or queen chancellor or daughter  she was perfectly obstinate  but at the same time she seemed more sedate than usual  perhaps that was because a great pleasure spoils laughing  at all events after this the passion of her life was to get into the water and she was always the better behaved and the more beautiful the more she had of it  summer and winter it was quite the same only she could not stay so long in the water when they had to break the ice to let her in  any day from morning till evening in summer she might be descried a streak of white in the blue water lying as still as the shadow of a cloud or shooting along like a dolphin disappearing and coming up again far off just where one did not expect her  she would have been in the lake of a night too if she could have had her way for the balcony of her window overhung a deep pool in it and through a shallow reedy passage she could have swum out into the wide wet water and no one would have been any the wiser  indeed when she happened to wake in the moonlight she could hardly resist the temptation  but there was the sad difficulty of getting into it  she had as great a dread of the air as some children have of the water  for the slightest gust of wind would blow her away and a gust might arise in the stillest moment and if she gave herself a push towards the water and just failed of reaching it her situation would be dreadfully awkward irrespective of the wind for at best there she would have to remain suspended in her nightgown till she was seen and angled for by someone from the window  oh if i had my gravity thought she contemplating the water i would flash off this balcony like a long white sea-bird headlong into the darling wetness  heigh-ho  this was the only consideration that made her wish to be like other people  another reason for her being fond of the water was that in it alone she enjoyed any freedom  for she could not walk out without a cortege consisting in part of a troop of light horse for fear of the liberties which the wind might take with her  and the king grew more apprehensive with increasing years till at last he would not allow her to walk abroad at all without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many parts of her dress and held by twenty noblemen  of course horseback was out of the question  but she bade good-by to all this ceremony when she got into the water  and so remarkable were its effects upon her especially in restoring her for the time to the ordinary human gravity that hum-drum and kopy-keck agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three years in the hope that as the water did her so much good the earth would do her yet more  but the king had some vulgar prejudices against the experiment and would not give his consent  foiled in this they yet agreed in another recommendation which seeing that one imported his opinions from china and the other from thibet was very remarkable indeed  they argued that if water of external origin and application could be so efficacious water from a deeper source might work a perfect cure in short that if the poor afflicted princess could by any means be made to cry she might recover her lost gravity  but how was this to be brought about  therein lay all the difficulty to meet which the philosophers were not wise enough  to make the princess cry was as impossible as to make her weigh  they sent for a professional beggar commanded him to prepare his most touching oracle of woe helped him out of the court charade box to whatever he wanted for dressing up and promised great rewards in the event of his success  but it was all in vain  she listened to the mendicant artist's story and gazed at his marvellous make up till she could contain herself no longer and went into the most undignified contortions for relief shrieking positively screeching with laughter  when she had a little recovered herself she ordered her attendants to drive him away and not give him a single copper whereupon his look of mortified discomfiture wrought her punishment and his revenge for it sent her into violent hysterics from which she was with difficulty recovered  but so anxious was the king that the suggestion should have a fair trial that he put himself in a rage one day and rushing up to her room gave her an awful whipping  yet not a tear would flow  she looked grave and her laughing sounded uncommonly like screaming that was all  the good old tyrant though he put on his best gold spectacles to look could not discover the smallest cloud in the serene blue of her eyes    9  put me in again  it must have been about this time that the son of a king who lived a thousand miles from lagobel set out to look for the daughter of a queen  he travelled far and wide but as sure as he found a princess he found some fault in her  of course he could not marry a mere woman however beautiful and there was no princess to be found worthy of him whether the prince was so near perfection that he had a right to demand perfection itself i cannot pretend to say  all i know is that he was a fine handsome brave generous well-bred and well-behaved youth as all princes are  in his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess but as everybody said she was bewitched he never dreamed that she could bewitch him  for what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity  who could tell what she might not lose next  she might lose her visibility or her tangibility or in short the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium so that he should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive  of course he made no further inquiries about her  one day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest  these forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers like a sieve that keeps back the bran then the princes get away to follow their fortunes  in this way they have the advantage of the princesses who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun  i wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes  one lovely evening after wandering about for many days he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them and he soon came upon a kind of heath  next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood but by this time it was getting late and there was nobody in the fields to direct him  after travelling for another hour his horse quite worn out with long labour and lack of food fell and was unable to rise again  so he continued his journey on foot  at length he entered another wood not a wild forest but a civilized wood through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake  along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness  suddenly he paused and listened strange sounds came across the water  it was in fact the princess laughing  now there was something odd in her laugh as i have already hinted for the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming  looking over the lake he saw something white in the water and in an instant he had torn off his tunic kicked off his sandals and plunged in  he soon reached the white object and found that it was a woman  there was not light enough to show that she was a princess but quite enough to show that she was a lady for it does not want much light to see that  now i cannot tell how it came about whether she pretended to be drowning or whether he frightened her or caught her so as to embarrass her but certainly he brought her to shore in a fashion ignominious to a swimmer and more nearly drowned than she had ever expected to be for the water had got into her throat as often as she had tried to speak  at the place to which he bore her the bank was only a foot or two above the water so he gave her a strong lift out of the water to lay her on the bank  but her gravitation ceasing the moment she left the water away she went up into the air scolding and screaming  you naughty naughty naughty naughty man she cried  no one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before when the prince saw her ascend he thought he must have been bewitched and have mistaken a great swan for a lady  but the princess caught hold of the topmost cone upon a lofty fir  this came off but she caught at another and in fact stopped herself by gathering cones dropping them as the stalks gave way  the prince meantime stood in the water staring and forgetting to get out  but the princess disappearing he scrambled on shore and went in the direction of the tree  there he found her climbing down one of the branches towards the stem  but in the darkness of the wood the prince continued in some bewilderment as to what the phenomenon could be until reaching the ground and seeing him standing there she caught hold of him and said   i'll tell papa  oh no you won't returned the prince  yes i will she persisted  what business had you to pull me down out of the water and throw me to the bottom of the air  i never did you any harm  pardon me  i did not mean to hurt you  i don't believe you have any brains and that is a worse loss than your wretched gravity  i pity you  the prince now saw that he had come upon the bewitched princess and had already offended her  but before he could think what to say next she burst out angrily giving a stamp with her foot that would have sent her aloft again but for the hold she had of his arm   put me up directly  put you up where you beauty asked the prince  he had fallen in love with her almost already for her anger made her more charming than any one else had ever beheld her and as far as he could see which certainly was not far she had not a single fault about her except of course that she had not any gravity  no prince however would judge of a princess by weight  the loveliness of her foot he would hardly estimate by the depth of the impression it could make in mud  put you up where you beauty asked the prince  in the water you stupid answered the princess  come then said the prince  the condition of her dress increasing her usual difficulty in walking compelled her to cling to him and he could hardly persuade himself that he was not in a delightful dream notwithstanding the torrent of musical abuse with which she overwhelmed him  the prince being therefore in no hurry they came upon the lake at quite another part where the bank was twenty-five feet high at least and when they had reached the edge he turned towards the princess and said   how am i to put you in that is your business she answered quite snappishly  you took me out put me in again  very well said the prince and catching her up in his arms he sprang with her from the rock  the princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them  when they came to the surface she found that for a moment or two she could not even laugh for she had gone down with such a rush that it was with difficulty she recovered her breath  the instant they reached the surface   how do you like falling in said the prince  after some effort the princess panted out   is that what you call falling in  yes answered the prince i should think it a very tolerable specimen  it seemed to me like going up rejoined she  my feeling was certainly one of elevation too the prince conceded  the princess did not appear to understand him for she retorted his question    how do you like falling in said the princess  beyond everything answered he for i have fallen in with the only perfect creature i ever saw  no more of that  i am tired of it said the princess  perhaps she shared her father's aversion to punning  don't you like falling in then said the prince  it is the most delightful fun i ever had in my life answered she i never fell before  i wish i could learn  to think i am the only person in my father's kingdom that can't fall  here the poor princess looked almost sad  i shall be most happy to fall in with you any time you like said the prince devotedly  thank you  i don't know  perhaps it would not be proper  but i don't care  at all events as we have fallen in let us have a swim together  with all my heart responded the prince  and away they went swimming and diving and floating until at last they heard cries along the shore and saw lights glancing in all directions  it was now quite late and there was no moon  i must go home said the princess  i am very sorry for this is delightful  so am i returned the prince  but i am glad i haven't a home to go to at least i don't exactly know where it is  i wish i hadn't one either rejoined the princess it is so stupid i have a great mind she continued to play them all a trick  why couldn't they leave me alone  they won't trust me in the lake for a single night you see where that green light is burning  that is the window of my room  now if you would just swim there with me very quietly and when we are all but under the balcony give me such a push up you call it-as you did a little while ago i should be able to catch hold of the balcony and get in at the window and then they may look for me till to-morrow morning  with more obedience than pleasure said the prince gallantly and away they swam very gently  will you be in the lake to-morrow night the prince ventured to ask  to be sure i will  i don't think so  perhaps was the princess's somewhat strange answer  but the prince was intelligent enough not to press her further and merely whispered as he gave her the parting lift don't tell  the only answer the princess returned was a roguish look  she was already a yard above his head  the look seemed to say never fear it is too good fun to spoil that way  so perfectly like other people had she been in the water that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly grasp the balcony and disappear through the window  he turned almost expecting to see her still by his side  but he was alone in the water  so he swam away quietly and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber  as soon as they disappeared he landed in search of his tunic and sword and after some trouble found them again  then he made the best of his way round the lake to the other side  there the wood was wilder and the shore steeper-rising more immediately towards the mountains which surrounded the lake on all sides and kept sending it messages of silvery streams from morning to night and all night long he soon found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess's room and where even in the broad daylight he would be in no danger of being discovered from the opposite shore  it was a sort of cave in the rock where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves and lay down too tired for hunger to keep him awake  all night long he dreamed that he was swimming with the princess    10  look at the moon  early the next morning the prince set out to look for something to eat which he soon found at a forester's hut where for many following days he was supplied with all that a brave prince could consider necessary and having plenty to keep him alive for the present he would not think of wants not yet in existence  whenever care intruded this prince always bowed him out in the most princely manner  when he returned from his breakfast to his watch-cave he saw the princess already floating about in the lake attended by the king and queen whom he knew by their crowns and a great company in lovely little boats with canopies of all the colours of the rainbow and flags and streamers of a great many more  it was a very bright day and soon the prince burned up with the heat began to long for the cold water and the cool princess  but he had to endure till twilight for the boats had provisions on board and it was not till the sun went down that the gay party began to vanish  boat after boat drew away to the shore following that of the king and queen till only one apparently the princess's own boat remained  but she did not want to go home even yet and the prince thought he saw her order the boat to the shore without her  at all events it rowed away and now of all the radiant company only one white speck remained  then the prince began to sing and this is what he sung      lady fair   swan-white   lift thine eyes   banish night   by the might   of thine eyes    snowy arms   oars of snow   oar her hither   plashing low   soft and slow   oar her hither    stream behind her   o'er the lake   radiant whiteness   in her wake   following following for her sake   radiant whiteness    cling about her   waters blue   part not from her   but renew   cold and true   kisses round her    lap me round   waters sad   that have left her   make me glad   for ye had   kissed her ere ye left her  before he had finished his song the princess was just under the place where he sat and looking up to find him  her ears had led her truly  would you like a fall princess said the prince looking down  ah there you are  yes if you please prince said the princess looking up  how do you know i am a prince princess said the prince  because you are a very nice young man prince said the princess  come up then princess  fetch me prince  the prince took off his scarf then his sword-belt then his tunic and tied them all together and let them down  but the line was far too short  he unwound his turban and added it to the rest when it was all but long enough and his purse completed it  the princess just managed to lay hold of the knot of money and was beside him in a moment  this rock was much higher than the other and the splash and the dive were tremendous  the princess was in ecstasies of delight and their swim was delicious  night after night they met and swam about in the dark clear lake where such was the prince's gladness that whether the princess's way of looking at things infected him or he was actually getting light-headed he often fancied that he was swimming in the sky instead of the lake  but when he talked about being in heaven the princess laughed at him dreadfully  when the moon came she brought them fresh pleasure  everything looked strange and new in her light with an old withered yet unfading newness  when the moon was nearly full one of their great delights was to dive deep in the water and then turning round look up through it at the great blot of light close above them shimmering and trembling and wavering spreading and contracting seeming to melt away and again grow solid  then they would shoot up through the blot and lo there was the moon far off clear and steady and cold and very lovely at the bottom of a deeper and bluer lake than theirs as the princess said  the prince soon found out that while in the water the princess was very like other people  and besides this she was not so forward in her questions or pert in her replies at sea as on shore  neither did she laugh so much and when she did laugh it was more gently  she seemed altogether more modest and maidenly in the water than out of it  but when the prince who had really fallen in love when he fell in the lake began to talk to her about love she always turned her head towards him and laughed  after a while she began to look puzzled as if she were trying to understand what he meant but could not revealing a notion that he meant something  but as soon as ever she left the lake she was so altered that the prince said to himself if i marry her i see no help for it  we must turn merman and mermaid and go out to sea at once    11  hiss  the princess's pleasure in the lake had grown to a passion and she could scarcely bear to be out of it for an hour  imagine then her consternation when diving with the prince one night a sudden suspicion seized her that the lake was not so deep as it used to be the prince could not imagine what had happened  she shot to the surface and without a word swam at full speed towards the higher side of the lake  he followed begging to know if she was ill or what was the matter  she never turned her head or took the smallest notice of his question  arrived at the shore she coasted the rocks with minute inspection  but she was not able to come to a conclusion for the moon was very small and so she could not see well  she turned therefore and swam home without saying a word to explain her conduct to the prince of whose presence she seemed no longer conscious  he withdrew to his cave in great perplexity and distress  next day she made many observations which alas strengthened her fears  she saw that the banks were too dry and that the grass on the shore and the trailing plants on the rocks were withering away  she caused marks to be made along the borders and examined them day after day in all directions of the wind till at last the horrible idea became a certain fact that the surface of the lake was slowly sinking  the poor princess nearly went out of the little mind she had  it was awful to her to see the lake which she loved more than any living thing lie dying before her eyes  it sank away slowly vanishing  the tops of rocks that had never been seen till now began to appear far down in the clear water  before long they were dry in the sun  it was fearful to think of the mud that would soon lie there baking and festering full of lovely creatures dying and ugly creatures coming to life like the unmaking of a world  and how hot the sun would be without any lake  she could not bear to swim in it any more and began to pine away  her life seemed bound up with it and ever as the lake sank she pined  people said she would not live an hour after the lake was gone  but she never cried  a proclamation was made to all the kingdom that whosoever should discover the cause of the lake's decrease would be rewarded after a princely fashion  hum-drum and kopy-keck applied themselves to their physics and metaphysics but in vain  not even they could suggest a cause  now the fact was that the old princess was at the root of the mischief when she heard that her niece found more pleasure in the water than any one else out of it she went into a rage and cursed herself for her want of foresight  but said she i will soon set all right  the king and the people shall die of thirst their brains shall boil and frizzle in their skulls before i will lose my revenge  and she laughed a ferocious laugh that made the hairs on the back of her black cat stand erect with terror  then she went to an old chest in the room and opening it took out what looked like a piece of dried seaweed  this she threw into a tub of water  then she threw some powder into the water and stirred it with her bare arm muttering over it words of hideous sound and yet more hideous import  then she set the tub aside and took from the chest a huge bunch of a hundred rusty keys that clattered in her shaking hands  then she sat down and proceeded to oil them all before she had finished out from the tub the water of which had kept on a slow motion ever since she had ceased stirring it came the head and half the body of a huge gray snake  but the witch did not look round  it grew out of the tub waving itself backwards and forwards with a slow horizontal motion till it reached the princess when it laid its head upon her shoulder and gave a low hiss in her ear  she started but with joy and seeing the head resting on her shoulder drew it towards her and kissed it  then she drew it all out of the tub and wound it round her body  it was one of those dreadful creatures which few have ever beheld the white snakes of darkness  then she took the keys and went down to her cellar and as she unlocked the door she said to herself   this is worth living for  locking the door behind her she descended a few steps into the cellar and crossing it unlocked another door into a dark narrow passage she locked this also behind her and descended a few more steps  if any one had followed the witch-princess he would have heard her unlock exactly one hundred doors and descend a few steps after unlocking each  when she had unlocked the last she entered a vast cave the roof of which was supported by huge natural pillars of rock  now this roof was the under side of the bottom of the lake  she then untwined the snake from her body and held it by the tail high above her  the hideous creature stretched up its head towards the roof of the cavern which it was just able to reach  it then began to move its head backwards and forwards with a slow oscillating motion as if looking for something  at the same moment the witch began to walk round and round the cavern coming nearer to the centre every circuit while the head of the snake described the same path over the roof that she did over the floor for she kept holding it up  and still it kept slowly oscillating  round and round the cavern they went ever lessening the circuit till at last the snake made a sudden dart and clung to the roof with its mouth  that's right my beauty cried the princess drain it dry  she let it go left it hanging and sat down on a great stone with her black cat which had followed her all round the cave by her side then she began to knit and mutter awful words  the snake hung like a huge leech sucking at the stone the cat stood with his back arched and his tail like a piece of cable looking up at the snake and the old woman sat and knitted and muttered  seven days and seven nights they remained thus when suddenly the serpent dropped from the roof as if exhausted and shrivelled up till it was again like a piece of dried seaweed  the witch started to her feet picked it up put it in her pocket and looked up at the roof  one drop of water was trembling on the spot where the snake had been sucking  as soon as she saw that she turned and fled followed by her cat  shutting the door in a terrible hurry she locked it and having muttered some frightful words sped to the next which also she locked and muttered over and so with all the hundred doors till she arrived in her own cellar then she sat down on the floor ready to faint but listening with malicious delight to the rushing of the water which she could hear distinctly through all the hundred doors  but this was not enough  now that she had tasted revenge she lost her patience  without further measures the lake would be too long in disappearing  so the next night with the last shred of the dying old moon rising she took some of the water in which she had revived the snake put it in a bottle and set out accompanied by her cat  before morning she had made the entire circuit of the lake muttering fearful words as she crossed every stream and casting into it some of the water out of her bottle  when she had finished the circuit she muttered yet again and flung a handful of water towards the moon thereupon every spring in the country ceased to throb and bubble dying away like the pulse of a dying man  the next day there was no sound of falling water to be heard along the borders of the lake  the very courses were dry and the mountains showed no silvery streaks down their dark sides  and not alone had the fountains of mother earth ceased to flow for all the babies throughout the country were crying dreadfully only without tears    12  where is the prince  never since the night when the princess left him so abruptly had the prince had a single interview with her  he had seen her once or twice in the lake but as far as he could discover she had not been in it any more at night  he had sat and sung and looked in vain for his nereid while she like a true nereid was wasting away with her lake sinking as it sank withering as it dried  when at length he discovered the change that was taking place in the level of the water he was in great alarm and perplexity  he could not tell whether the lake was dying because the lady had forsaken it or whether the lady would not come because the lake had begun to sink  but he resolved to know so much at least  he disguised himself and going to the palace requested to see the lord chamberlain  his appearance at once gained his request and the lord chamberlain being a man of some insight perceived that there was more in the prince's solicitation than met the ear  he felt likewise that no one could tell whence a solution of the present difficulties might arise  so he granted the prince's prayer to be made shoeblack to the princess  it was rather cunning in the prince to request such an easy post for the princess could not possibly soil as many shoes as other princesses  he soon learned all that could be told about the princess  he went nearly distracted but after roaming about the lake for days and diving in every depth that remained all that he could do was to put an extra polish on the dainty pair of boots that was never called for  for the princess kept her room with the curtains drawn to shut out the dying lake but she could not shut it out of her mind for a moment  it haunted her imagination so that she felt as if the lake were her soul drying up within her first to mud then to madness and death  she thus brooded over the change with all its dreadful accompaniments till she was nearly distracted  as for the prince she had forgotten him  however much she had enjoyed his company in the water she did not care for him without it  but she seemed to have forgotten her father and mother too  the lake went on sinking  small slimy spots began to appear which glittered steadily amidst the changeful shine of the water  these grew to broad patches of mud which widened and spread with rocks here and there and floundering fishes and crawling eels swarming  the people went everywhere catching these and looking for anything that might have dropped from the royal boats  at length the lake was all but gone only a few of the deepest pools remaining unexhausted  it happened one day that a party of youngsters found themselves on the brink of one of these pools in the very centre of the lake  it was a rocky basin of considerable depth  looking in they saw at the bottom something that shone yellow in the sun  a little boy jumped in and dived for it  it was a plate of gold covered with writing  they carried it to the king  on one side of it stood these words      death alone from death can save   love is death and so is brave    love can fill the deepest grave   love loves on beneath the wave   now this was enigmatical enough to the king and courtiers  but the reverse of the plate explained it a little  its writing amounted to this    if the lake should disappear they must find the hole through which the water ran  but it would be useless to try to stop it by any ordinary means  there was but one effectual mode the body of a living man could alone stanch the flow  the man must give himself of his own will and the lake must take his life as it filled  otherwise the offering would be of no avail  if the nation could not provide one hero it was time it should perish    13  here i am  this was a very disheartening revelation to the king not that he was unwilling to sacrifice a subject but that he was hopeless of finding a man willing to sacrifice himself  no time was to be lost however for the princess was lying motionless on her bed and taking no nourishment but lake-water which was now none of the best  therefore the king caused the contents of the wonderful plate of gold to be published throughout the country  no one however came forward  the prince having gone several days' journey into the forest to consult a hermit whom he had met there on his way to lagobel knew nothing of the oracle till his return  when he had acquainted himself with all the particulars he sat down and thought   she will die if i don't do it and life would be nothing to me without her so i shall lose nothing by doing it  and life will be as pleasant to her as ever for she will soon forget me  and there will be so much more beauty and happiness in the world to be sure i shall not see it  here the poor prince gave a sigh how lovely the lake will be in the moonlight with that glorious creature sporting in it like a wild goddess it is rather hard to be drowned by inches though  let me see that will be seventy inches of me to drown  here he tried to laugh but could not the longer the better however he resumed  for can i not bargain that the princess shall be beside me all the time  so i shall see her once more kiss her perhaps who knows and die looking in her eyes  it will be no death  at least i shall not feel it  and to see the lake filling for the beauty again all right i am ready  he kissed the princess's boot laid it down and hurried to the king's apartment  but feeling as he went that anything sentimental would be disagreeable he resolved to carry off the whole affair with nonchalance  so he knocked at the door of the king's counting-house where it was all but a capital crime to disturb him  when the king heard the knock he started up and opened the door in a rage  seeing only the shoeblack he drew his sword  this i am sorry to say was his usual mode of asserting his regality when he thought his dignity was in danger  but the prince was not in the least alarmed  please your majesty i'm your butler said he  my butler you lying rascal  what do you mean  i mean i will cork your big bottle  is the fellow mad bawled the king raising the point of his sword  i will put a stopper plug what you call it in your leaky lake grand monarch said the prince  the king was in such a rage that before he could speak he had time to cool and to reflect that it would be great waste to kill the only man who was willing to be useful in the present emergency seeing that in the end the insolent fellow would be as dead as if he had died by his majesty's own hand  oh said he at last putting up his sword with difficulty it was so long i am obliged to you you young fool  take a glass of wine  no thank you replied the prince  very well said the king  would you like to run and see your parents before you make your experiment  no thank you said the prince  then we will go and look for the hole at once said his majesty and proceeded to call some attendants  stop please your majesty i have a condition to make interposed the prince  what exclaimed the king a condition and with me  how dare you  as you please returned the prince coolly  i wish your majesty a good morning  you wretch  i will have you put in a sack and stuck in the hole  very well your majesty replied the prince becoming a little more respectful lest the wrath of the king should deprive him of the pleasure of dying for the princess  but what good will that do your majesty  please to remember that the oracle says the victim must offer himself  well you have offered yourself retorted the king  yes upon one condition  condition again roared the king once more drawing his sword begone  somebody else will be glad enough to take the honour off your shoulders  your majesty knows it will not be easy to get another to take my place  well what is your condition growled the king feeling that the prince was right  only this replied the prince  that as i must on no account die before i am fairly drowned and the waiting will be rather wearisome the princess your daughter shall go with me feed me with her own hands and look at me now and then to comfort me for you must confess it is rather hard  as soon as the water is up to my eyes she may go and be happy and forget her poor shoeblack  here the prince's voice faltered and he very nearly grew sentimental in spite of his resolution  why didn't you tell me before what your condition was  such a fuss about nothing exclaimed the king  do you grant it persisted the prince  of course i do replied the king  very well  i am ready  go and have some dinner then while i set my people to find the place  the king ordered out his guards and gave directions to the officers to find the hole in the lake at once  so the bed of the lake was marked out in divisions and thoroughly examined and in an hour or so the hole was discovered  it was in the middle of a stone near the centre of the lake in the very pool where the golden plate had been found  it was a three-cornered hole of no great size  there was water all round the stone but very little was flowing through the hole    14  this is very kind of you  the prince went to dress for the occasion for he was resolved to die like a prince  when the princess heard that a man had offered to die for her she was so transported that she jumped off the bed feeble as she was and danced about the room for joy  she did not care who the man was that was nothing to her  the hole wanted stopping and if only a man would do why take one  in an hour or two more everything was ready  her maid dressed her in haste and they carried her to the side of the lake  when she saw it she shrieked and covered her face with her hands  they bore her across to the stone where they had already placed a little boat for her  the water was not deep enough to float it but they hoped it would be before long  they laid her on cushions placed in the boat wines and fruits and other nice things and stretched a canopy over all  in a few minutes the prince appeared  the princess recognized him at once but did not think it worth while to acknowledge him  here i am said the prince  put me in  they told me it was a shoeblack said the princess  so i am said the prince  i blacked your little boots three times a day because they were all i could get of you  put me in  the courtiers did not resent his bluntness except by saying to each other that he was taking it out in impudence  but how was he to be put in  the golden plate contained no instructions on this point  the prince looked at the hole and saw but one way  he put both his legs into it sitting on the stone and stooping forward covered the corner that remained open with his two hands  in this uncomfortable position he resolved to abide his fate and turning to the people said   now you can go  the king had already gone home to dinner  now you can go repeated the princess after him like a parrot  the people obeyed her and went  presently a little wave flowed over the stone and wetted one of the prince's knees  but he did not mind it much  he began to sing and the song he sang was this      as a world that has no well   darting bright in forest dell   as a world without the gleam   of the downward-going stream   as a world without the glance   of the ocean's fair expanse   as a world where never rain   glittered on the sunny plain    such my heart thy world would be   if no love did flow in thee    as a world without the sound   of the rivulets underground   or the bubbling of the spring   out of darkness wandering   or the mighty rush and flowing   of the river's downward going   or the music-showers that drop   on the outspread beech's top   or the ocean's mighty voice   when his lifted waves rejoice    such my soul thy world would be   if no love did sing in thee    lady keep thy world's delight   keep the waters in thy sight   love hath made me strong to go   for thy sake to realms below   where the water's shine and hum   through the darkness never come   let i pray one thought of me   spring a little well in thee   lest thy loveless soul be found   like a dry and thirsty ground   sing again prince  it makes it less tedious said the princess  but the prince was too much overcome to sing any more and a long pause followed  this is very kind of you prince said the princess at last quite coolly as she lay in the boat with her eyes shut  i am sorry i can't return the compliment thought the prince but you are worth dying for after all  again a wavelet and another and another flowed over the stone and wetted both the prince's knees but he did not speak or move two three four hours passed in this way the princess apparently asleep and the prince very patient  but he was much disappointed in his position for he had none of the consolation he had hoped for  at last he could bear it no longer  princess said he  but at the moment up started the princess crying   i'm afloat  i'm afloat  and the little boat bumped against the stone  princess repeated the prince encouraged by seeing her wide awake and looking eagerly at the water  well said she without looking round  your papa promised that you should look at me and you haven't looked at me once  did he  then i suppose i must  but i am so sleepy  sleep then darling and don't mind me said the poor prince  really you are very good replied the princess  i think i will go to sleep again  just give me a glass of wine and a biscuit first said the prince very humbly  with all my heart said the princess and gaped as she said it  she got the wine and the biscuit however and leaning over the side of the boat towards him was compelled to look at him  why prince she said you don't look well  are you sure you don't mind it not a bit answered he feeling very faint indeed  only i shall die before it is of any use to you unless i have something to eat  there then said she holding out the wine to him  ah you must feed me  i dare not move my hands  the water would run away directly  good gracious said the princess and she began at once to feed him with bits of biscuit and sips of wine  as she fed him he contrived to kiss the tips of her fingers now and then  she did not seem to mind it one way or the other  but the prince felt better  now for your own sake princess said he i cannot let you go to sleep  you must sit and look at me else i shall not be able to keep up  well i will do anything i can to oblige you answered she with condescension and sitting down she did look at him and kept looking at him with wonderful steadiness considering all things  the sun went down and the moon rose and gush after gush the waters were rising up the prince's body  they were up to his waist now  why can't we go and have a swim said the princess  there seems to be water enough just about here  i shall never swim more said the prince  oh i forgot said the princess and was silent  so the water grew and grew and rose up and up on the prince  and the princess sat and looked at him  she fed him now and then  the night wore on  the waters rose and rose  the moon rose likewise higher and higher and shone full on the face of the dying prince  the water was up to his neck  will you kiss me princess said he feebly  the nonchalance was all gone now  yes i will answered the princess and kissed him with a long sweet cold kiss  now said he with a sigh of content i die happy  he did not speak again  the princess gave him some wine for the last time  he was past eating  then she sat down again and looked at him the water rose and rose  it touched his chin  it touched his lower lip  it touched between his lips  he shut them hard to keep it out the princess began to feel strange  it touched his upper lip  he breathed through his nostrils  the princess looked wild  it covered his nostrils  her eyes looked scared and shone strange in the moonlight  his head fell back the water closed over it and the bubbles of his last breath bubbled up through the water  the princess gave a shriek and sprang into the lake  she laid hold first of one leg and then of the other and pulled and tugged but she could not move either  she stopped to take breath and that made her think that he could not get any breath  she was frantic she got hold of him and held his head above the water which was possible now his hands were no longer on the hole  but it was of no use for he was past breathing  love and water brought back all her strength  she got under the water and pulled and pulled with her whole might till at last she got one leg out  the other easily followed  how she got him into the boat she never could tell but when she did she fainted away  coming to herself she seized the oars kept herself steady as best she could and rowed and rowed though she had never rowed before  round rocks and over shallows and through mud she rowed till she got to the landing-stairs of the palace  by this time her people were on the shore for they had heard her shriek  she made them carry the prince to her own room and lay him in her bed and light a fire and send for the doctors  but the lake your highness said the chamberlain who roused by the noise came in in his nightcap  go and drown yourself in it she said  this was the last rudeness of which the princess was ever guilty and one must allow that she had good cause to feel provoked with the lord chamberlain  had it been the king himself he would have fared no better  but both he and the queen were fast asleep  and the chamberlain went back to his bed  somehow the doctors never came  so the princess and her old nurse were left with the prince  but the old nurse was a wise woman and knew what to do  they tried everything for a long time without success  the princess was nearly distracted between hope and fear but she tried on and on one thing after another and everything over and over again  at last when they had all but given it up just as the sun rose the prince opened his eyes    15  look at the rain  the princess burst into a passion of tears and fell on the floor there she lay for an hour and her tears never ceased  all the pent-up crying of her life was spent now  and a rain came on such as had never been seen in that country  the sun shone all the time and the great drops which fell straight to the earth shone likewise  the palace was in the heart of a rainbow  it was a rain of rubies and sapphires and emeralds and topazes  the torrents poured from the mountains like molten gold and if it had not been for its subterraneous outlet the lake would have overflowed and inundated the country  it was full from shore to shore  but the princess did not heed the lake  she lay on the floor and wept and this rain within doors was far more wonderful than the rain out of doors  for when it abated a little and she proceeded to rise she found to her astonishment that she could not  at length after many efforts she succeeded in getting upon her feet  but she tumbled down again directly  hearing her fall her old nurse uttered a yell of delight and ran to her screaming   my darling child she's found her gravity  oh that's it is it said the princess rubbing her shoulder and her knee alternately  i consider it very unpleasant  i feel as if i should be crushed to pieces  hurrah cried the prince from the bed  if you've come round princess so have i  how's the lake  brimful answered the nurse  then we're all happy  that we are indeed answered the princess sobbing  and there was rejoicing all over the country that rainy day  even the babies forgot their past troubles and danced and crowed amazingly and the king told stories and the queen listened to them  and he divided the money in his box and she the honey in her pot among all the children  and there was such jubilation as was never heard of before  of course the prince and princess were betrothed at once  but the princess had to learn to walk before they could be married with any propriety  and this was not so easy at her time of life for she could walk no more than a baby  she was always falling down and hurting herself  is this the gravity you used to make so much of said she one day to the prince as he raised her from the floor  for my part i was a great deal more comfortable without it  no no that's not it  this is it replied the prince as he took her up and carried her about like a baby kissing her all the time this is gravity  that's better said she  i don't mind that so much  and she smiled the sweetest loveliest smile in the prince's face  and she gave him one little kiss in return for all his and he thought them overpaid for he was beside himself with delight  i fear she complained of her gravity more than once after this notwithstanding  it was a long time before she got reconciled to walking  but the pain of learning it was quite counterbalanced by two things either of which would have been sufficient consolation  the first was that the prince himself was her teacher and the second that she could tumble into the lake as often as she pleased  still she preferred to have the prince jump in with her and the splash they made before was nothing to the splash they made now  the lake never sank again  in process of time it wore the roof of the cavern quite through and was twice as deep as before  the only revenge the princess took upon her aunt was to tread pretty hard on her gouty toe the next time she saw her  but she was sorry for it the very next day when she heard that the water had undermined her house and that it had fallen in the night burying her in its ruins whence no one ever ventured to dig up her body  there she lies to this day  so the prince and princess lived and were happy and had crowns of gold and clothes of cloth and shoes of leather and children of boys and girls not one of whom was ever known on the most critical occasion to lose the smallest atom of his or her due proportion of gravity"@"The Light Princess and the Goblin"@"George MacDonald"

curdie's guide   29  masonwork   30  the king and the kiss   31  the subterranean waters   32  the last chapter     chapter 1  why the princess has a story about her  there was once a little princess whose father was king over a great country full of mountains and valleys  his palace was built upon one of the mountains and was very grand and beautiful  the princess whose name was irene was born there but she was sent soon after her birth because her mother was not very strong to be brought up by country people in a large house half castle half farmhouse on the side of another mountain about half-way between its base and its peak  the princess was a sweet little creature and at the time my story begins was about eight years old i think but she got older very fast her face was fair and pretty with eyes like two bits of night sky each with a star dissolved in the blue  those eyes you would have thought must have known they came from there so often were they turned up in that direction  the ceiling of her nursery was blue with stars in it as like the sky as they could make it but i doubt if ever she saw the real sky with the stars in it for a reason which i had better mention at once  these mountains were full of hollow places underneath huge caverns and winding ways some with water running through them and some shining with all colours of the rainbow when a light was taken in there would not have been much known about them had there not been mines there great deep pits with long galleries and passages running off from them which had been dug to get at the ore of which the mountains were full  in the course of digging the miners came upon many of these natural caverns  a few of them had far-off openings out on the side of a mountain or into a ravine  now in these subterranean caverns lived a strange race of beings called by some gnomes by some kobolds by some goblins  there was a legend current in the country that at one time they lived above ground and were very like other people  but for some reason or other concerning which there were different legendary theories the king had laid what they thought too severe taxes upon them or had required observances of them they did not like or had begun to treat them with more severity in some way or other and impose stricter laws and the consequence was that they had all disappeared from the face of the country  according to the legend however instead of going to some other country they had all taken refuge in the subterranean caverns whence they never came out but at night and then seldom showed themselves in any numbers and never to many people at once  it was only in the least frequented and most difficult parts of the mountains that they were said to gather even at night in the open air  those who had caught sight of any of them said that they had greatly altered in the course of generations and no wonder seeing they lived away from the sun in cold and wet and dark places  they were now not ordinarily ugly but either absolutely hideous or ludicrously grotesque both in face and form  there was no invention they said of the most lawless imagination expressed by pen or pencil that could surpass the extravagance of their appearance  but i suspect those who said so had mistaken some of their animal companions for the goblins themselves of which more by and by  the goblins themselves were not so far removed from the human as such a description would imply  and as they grew misshapen in body they had grown in knowledge and cleverness and now were able to do things no mortal could see the possibility of  but as they grew in cunning they grew in mischief and their great delight was in every way they could think of to annoy the people who lived in the open-air storey above them  they had enough of affection left for each other to preserve them from being absolutely cruel for cruelty's sake to those that came in their way but still they so heartily cherished the ancestral grudge against those who occupied their former possessions and especially against the descendants of the king who had caused their expulsion that they sought every opportunity of tormenting them in ways that were as odd as their inventors and although dwarfed and misshapen they had strength equal to their cunning  in the process of time they had got a king and a government of their own whose chief business beyond their own simple affairs was to devise trouble for their neighbours  it will now be pretty evident why the little princess had never seen the sky at night  they were much too afraid of the goblins to let her out of the house then even in company with ever so many attendants and they had good reason as we shall see by and by    chapter 2  the princess loses herself  i have said the princess irene was about eight years old when my story begins  and this is how it begins  one very wet day when the mountain was covered with mist which was constantly gathering itself together into raindrops and pouring down on the roofs of the great old house whence it fell in a fringe of water from the eaves all round about it the princess could not of course go out  she got very tired so tired that even her toys could no longer amuse her  you would wonder at that if i had time to describe to you one half of the toys she had  but then you wouldn't have the toys themselves and that makes all the difference  you can't get tired of a thing before you have it  it was a picture though worth seeing the princess sitting in the nursery with the sky ceiling over her head at a great table covered with her toys  if the artist would like to draw this i should advise him not to meddle with the toys  i am afraid of attempting to describe them and i think he had better not try to draw them  he had better not  he can do a thousand things i can't but i don't think he could draw those toys  no man could better make the princess herself than he could though leaning with her back bowed into the back of the chair her head hanging down and her hands in her lap very miserable as she would say herself not even knowing what she would like except it were to go out and get thoroughly wet and catch a particularly nice cold and have to go to bed and take gruel  the next moment after you see her sitting there her nurse goes out of the room  even that is a change and the princess wakes up a little and looks about her  then she tumbles off her chair and runs out of the door not the same door the nurse went out of but one which opened at the foot of a curious old stair of worm-eaten oak which looked as if never anyone had set foot upon it  she had once before been up six steps and that was sufficient reason in such a day for trying to find out what was at the top of it  up and up she ran such a long way it seemed to her until she came to the top of the third flight  there she found the landing was the end of a long passage  into this she ran  it was full of doors on each side  there were so many that she did not care to open any but ran on to the end where she turned into another passage also full of doors when she had turned twice more and still saw doors and only doors about her she began to get frightened  it was so silent  and all those doors must hide rooms with nobody in them  that was dreadful also the rain made a great trampling noise on the roof  she turned and started at full speed her little footsteps echoing through the sounds of the rain back for the stairs and her safe nursery  so she thought but she had lost herself long ago  it doesn't follow that she was lost because she had lost herself though  she ran for some distance turned several times and then began to be afraid  very soon she was sure that she had lost the way back rooms everywhere and no stair  her little heart beat as fast as her little feet ran and a lump of tears was growing in her throat but she was too eager and perhaps too frightened to cry for some time  at last her hope failed her  nothing but passages and doors everywhere  she threw herself on the floor and burst into a wailing cry broken by sobs  she did not cry long however for she was as brave as could be expected of a princess of her age  after a good cry she got up and brushed the dust from her frock  oh what old dust it was then she wiped her eyes with her hands for princesses don't always have their handkerchiefs in their pockets any more than some other little girls i know of  next like a true princess she resolved on going wisely to work to find her way back  she would walk through the passages and look in every direction for the stair this she did but without success  she went over the same ground again an again without knowing it for the passages and doors were all alike  at last in a corner through a half-open door she did see a stair  but alas it went the wrong way  instead of going down it went up  frightened as she was however she could not help wishing to see where yet further the stair could lead  it was very narrow and so steep that she went on like a four-legged creature on her hands and feet    chapter 3  the princess and we shall see who  when she came to the top she found herself in a little square place with three doors two opposite each other and one opposite the top of the stair  she stood for a moment without an idea in her little head what to do next  but as she stood she began to hear a curious humming sound  could it be the rain  no  it was much more gentle and even monotonous than the sound of the rain which now she scarcely heard the low sweet humming sound went on sometimes stopping for a little while and then beginning again  it was more like the hum of a very happy bee that had found a rich well of honey in some globular flower than anything else i can think of at this moment  where could it come from  she laid her ear first to one of the doors to hearken if it was there then to another  when she laid her ear against the third door there could be no doubt where it came from  it must be from something in that room  what could it be  she was rather afraid but her curiosity was stronger than her fear and she opened the door very gently and peeped in  what do you think she saw  a very old lady who sat spinning  perhaps you will wonder how the princess could tell that the old lady was an old lady when i inform you that not only was she beautiful but her skin was smooth and white  i will tell you more  her hair was combed back from her forehead and face and hung loose far down and all over her back  that is not much like an old lady is it  ah but it was white almost as snow  and although her face was so smooth her eyes looked so wise that you could not have helped seeing she must be old  the princess though she could not have told you why did think her very old indeed quite fifty she said to herself  but she was rather older than that as you shall hear  while the princess stared bewildered with her head just inside the door the old lady lifted hers and said in a sweet but old and rather shaky voice which mingled very pleasantly with the continued hum of her wheel   'come in my dear come in  i am glad to see you'  that the princess was a real princess you might see now quite plainly for she didn't hang on to the handle of the door and stare without moving as i have known some do who ought to have been princesses but were only rather vulgar little girls  she did as she was told stepped inside the door at once and shut it gently behind her  'come to me my dear' said the old lady  and again the princess did as she was told  she approached the old lady rather slowly i confess but did not stop until she stood by her side and looked up in her face with her blue eyes and the two melted stars in them  'why what have you been doing with your eyes child' asked the old lady  'crying' answered the princess  'why child'  'because i couldn't find my way down again'  'but you could find your way up'  'not at first not for a long time'  'but your face is streaked like the back of a zebra  hadn't you a handkerchief to wipe your eyes with'  'no'  'then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you'  'please i didn't know you were here  i will next time'  'there's a good child' said the old lady  then she stopped her wheel and rose and going out of the room returned with a little silver basin and a soft white towel with which she washed and wiped the bright little face  and the princess thought her hands were so smooth and nice  when she carried away the basin and towel the little princess wondered to see how straight and tall she was for although she was so old she didn't stoop a bit  she was dressed in black velvet with thick white heavy-looking lace about it and on the black dress her hair shone like silver  there was hardly any more furniture in the room than there might have been in that of the poorest old woman who made her bread by her spinning  there was no carpet on the floor no table anywhere nothing but the spinning-wheel and the chair beside it  when she came back she sat down and without a word began her spinning once more while irene who had never seen a spinning-wheel stood by her side and looked on  when the old lady had got her thread fairly going again she said to the princess but without looking at her   'do you know my name child'  'no i don't know it' answered the princess  'my name is irene'  'that's my name' cried the princess  'i know that  i let you have mine  i haven't got your name you've got mine'  'how can that be' asked the princess bewildered  'i've always had my name'  'your papa the king asked me if i had any objection to your having it and of course i hadn't  i let you have it with pleasure'  'it was very kind of you to give me your name and such a pretty one' said the princess  'oh not so very kind' said the old lady  'a name is one of those things one can give away and keep all the same  i have a good many such things  wouldn't you like to know who i am child'  'yes that i should very much'  'i'm your great-great-grandmother' said the lady  'what's that' asked the princess  'i'm your father's mother's father's mother'  'oh dear i can't understand that' said the princess  'i dare say not  i didn't expect you would  but that's no reason why i shouldn't say it'  'oh no' answered the princess  'i will explain it all to you when you are older' the lady went on 'but you will be able to understand this much now  i came here to take care of you'  'is it long since you came  was it yesterday  or was it today because it was so wet that i couldn't get out'  'i've been here ever since you came yourself'  'what a long time' said the princess  'i don't remember it at all'  'no  i suppose not'  'but i never saw you before'  'no  but you shall see me again'  'do you live in this room always'  'i don't sleep in it  i sleep on the opposite side of the landing i sit here most of the day'  'i shouldn't like it  my nursery is much prettier  you must be a queen too if you are my great big grand-mother'  'yes i am a queen'  'where is your crown then' 'in my bedroom'  'i should like to see it'  'you shall some day not today'  'i wonder why nursie never told me'  'nursie doesn't know  she never saw me'  'but somebody knows that you are in the house'  'no nobody'  'how do you get your dinner then'  'i keep poultry of a sort'  'where do you keep them'  'i will show you'  'and who makes the chicken broth for you'  'i never kill any of my chickens'  'then i can't understand'  'what did you have for breakfast this morning' asked the lady  'oh i had bread and milk and an egg i dare say you eat their eggs'  'yes that's it  i eat their eggs'  'is that what makes your hair so white'  'no my dear  it's old age  i am very old'  'i thought so  are you fifty'  'yes more than that'  'are you a hundred'  'yes more than that  i am too old for you to guess  come and see my chickens'  again she stopped her spinning  she rose took the princess by the hand led her out of the room and opened the door opposite the stair the princess expected to see a lot of hens and chickens but instead of that she saw the blue sky first and then the roofs of the house with a multitude of the loveliest pigeons mostly white but of all colours walking about making bows to each other and talking a language she could not understand  she clapped her hands with delight and up rose such a flapping of wings that she in her turn was startled  'you've frightened my poultry' said the old lady smiling  'and they've frightened me' said the princess smiling too  'but what very nice poultry  are the eggs nice'  'yes very nice' 'what a small egg-spoon you must have  wouldn't it be better to keep hens and get bigger eggs'  'how should i feed them though'  'i see' said the princess  'the pigeons feed themselves  they've got wings'  'just so  if they couldn't fly i couldn't eat their eggs'  'but how do you get at the eggs  where are their nests'  the lady took hold of a little loop of string in the wall at the side of the door and lifting a shutter showed a great many pigeon-holes with nests some with young ones and some with eggs in them  the birds came in at the other side and she took out the eggs on this side  she closed it again quickly lest the young ones should be frightened  'oh what a nice way' cried the princess  'will you give me an egg to eat  i'm rather hungry'  'i will some day but now you must go back or nursie will be miserable about you  i dare say she's looking for you everywhere'  'except here' answered the princess  'oh how surprised she will be when i tell her about my great big grand-grand-mother'  'yes that she will' said the old lady with a curious smile 'mind you tell her all about it exactly'  'that i will  please will you take me back to her'  'i can't go all the way but i will take you to the top of the stair and then you must run down quite fast into your own room'  the little princess put her hand in the old lady's who looking this way and that brought her to the top of the first stair and thence to the bottom of the second and did not leave her till she saw her half-way down the third  when she heard the cry of her nurse's pleasure at finding her she turned and walked up the stairs again very fast indeed for such a very great grandmother and sat down to her spinning with another strange smile on her sweet old face  about this spinning of hers i will tell you more another time  guess what she was spinning    chapter 4  what the nurse thought of it  'why where can you have been princess' asked the nurse taking her in her arms  'it's very unkind of you to hide away so long i began to be afraid '  here she checked herself  'what were you afraid of nursie' asked the princess  'never mind' she answered  'perhaps i will tell you another day now tell me where you have been'  'i've been up a long way to see my very great huge old grandmother' said the princess  'what do you mean by that' asked the nurse who thought she was making fun  'i mean that i've been a long way up and up to see my great grandmother  ah nursie you don't know what a beautiful mother of grandmothers i've got upstairs  she is such an old lady with such lovely white hair as white as my silver cup  now when i think of it i think her hair must be silver'  'what nonsense you are talking princess' said the nurse  'i'm not talking nonsense' returned irene rather offended  'i will tell you all about her  she's much taller than you and much prettier'  'oh i dare say' remarked the nurse  'and she lives upon pigeons' eggs'  'most likely' said the nurse  'and she sits in an empty room spin-spinning all day long'  'not a doubt of it' said the nurse  'and she keeps her crown in her bedroom'  'of course quite the proper place to keep her crown in  she wears it in bed i'll be bound'  'she didn't say that  and i don't think she does  that wouldn't be comfortable would it  i don't think my papa wears his crown for a night-cap  does he nursie'  'i never asked him  i dare say he does'  'and she's been there ever since i came here ever so many years'  'anybody could have told you that' said the nurse who did not believe a word irene was saying  'why didn't you tell me then'  'there was no necessity  you could make it all up for yourself'  'you don't believe me then' exclaimed the princess astonished and angry as she well might be  'did you expect me to believe you princess' asked the nurse coldly 'i know princesses are in the habit of telling make-believes but you are the first i ever heard of who expected to have them believed' she added seeing that the child was strangely in earnest  the princess burst into tears  'well i must say' remarked the nurse now thoroughly vexed with her for crying 'it is not at all becoming in a princess to tell stories and expect to be believed just because she is a princess'  'but it's quite true i tell you'  'you've dreamt it then child'  'no i didn't dream it  i went upstairs and i lost myself and if i hadn't found the beautiful lady i should never have found myself'  'oh i dare say'  'well you just come up with me and see if i'm not telling the truth'  'indeed i have other work to do  it's your dinnertime and i won't have any more such nonsense'  the princess wiped her eyes and her face grew so hot that they were soon quite dry  she sat down to her dinner but ate next to nothing not to be believed does not at all agree with princesses  for a real princess cannot tell a lie  so all the afternoon she did not speak a word  only when the nurse spoke to her she answered her for a real princess is never rude even when she does well to be offended  of course the nurse was not comfortable in her mind not that she suspected the least truth in irene's story but that she loved her dearly and was vexed with herself for having been cross to her she thought her crossness was the cause of the princess's unhappiness and had no idea that she was really and deeply hurt at not being believed but as it became more and more plain during the evening in her every motion and look that although she tried to amuse herself with her toys her heart was too vexed and troubled to enjoy them her nurse's discomfort grew and grew  when bedtime came she undressed and laid her down but the child instead of holding up her little mouth to be kissed turned away from her and lay still  then nursie's heart gave way altogether and she began to cry  at the sound of her first sob the princess turned again and held her face to kiss her as usual  but the nurse had her handkerchief to her eyes and did not see the movement  'nursie' said the princess 'why won't you believe me'  'because i can't believe you' said the nurse getting angry again  'ah then you can't help it' said irene 'and i will not be vexed with you any more  i will give you a kiss and go to sleep'  'you little angel' cried the nurse and caught her out of bed and walked about the room with her in her arms kissing and hugging her  'you will let me take you to see my dear old great big grandmother won't you' said the princess as she laid her down again  'and you won't say i'm ugly any more will you princess' 'nursie i never said you were ugly  what can you mean'  'well if you didn't say it you meant it'  'indeed i never did'  'you said i wasn't so pretty as that '  'as my beautiful grandmother yes i did say that and i say it again for it's quite true'  'then i do think you are unkind' said the nurse and put her handkerchief to her eyes again  'nursie dear everybody can't be as beautiful as every other body you know  you are very nice-looking but if you had been as beautiful as my grandmother '  'bother your grandmother' said the nurse  'nurse that's very rude  you are not fit to be spoken to till you can behave better'  the princess turned away once more and again the nurse was ashamed of herself  'i'm sure i beg your pardon princess' she said though still in an offended tone  but the princess let the tone pass and heeded only the words  'you won't say it again i am sure' she answered once more turning towards her nurse  'i was only going to say that if you had been twice as nice-looking as you are some king or other would have married you and then what would have become of me'  'you are an angel' repeated the nurse again embracing her 'now' insisted irene 'you will come and see my grandmother won't you'  'i will go with you anywhere you like my cherub' she answered and in two minutes the weary little princess was fast asleep    chapter 5  the princess lets well alone  when she woke the next morning the first thing she heard was the rain still falling  indeed this day was so like the last that it would have been difficult to tell where was the use of it  the first thing she thought of however was not the rain but the lady in the tower and the first question that occupied her thoughts was whether she should not ask the nurse to fulfil her promise this very morning and go with her to find her grandmother as soon as she had had her breakfast  but she came to the conclusion that perhaps the lady would not be pleased if she took anyone to see her without first asking leave especially as it was pretty evident seeing she lived on pigeons' eggs and cooked them herself that she did not want the household to know she was there  so the princess resolved to take the first opportunity of running up alone and asking whether she might bring her nurse  she believed the fact that she could not otherwise convince her she was telling the truth would have much weight with her grandmother  the princess and her nurse were the best of friends all dressing-time and the princess in consequence ate an enormous little breakfast  'i wonder lootie' that was her pet name for her nurse 'what pigeons' eggs taste like' she said as she was eating her egg not quite a common one for they always picked out the pinky ones for her  'we'll get you a pigeon's egg and you shall judge for yourself' said the nurse  'oh no no' returned irene suddenly reflecting they might disturb the old lady in getting it and that even if they did not she would have one less in consequence  'what a strange creature you are' said the nurse 'first to want a thing and then to refuse it'  but she did not say it crossly and the princess never minded any remarks that were not unfriendly  'well you see lootie there are reasons' she returned and said no more for she did not want to bring up the subject of their former strife lest her nurse should offer to go before she had had her grandmother's permission to bring her  of course she could refuse to take her but then she would believe her less than ever  now the nurse as she said herself afterwards could not be every moment in the room and as never before yesterday had the princess given her the smallest reason for anxiety it had not yet come into her head to watch her more closely  so she soon gave her a chance and the very first that offered irene was off and up the stairs again  this day's adventure however did not turn out like yesterday's although it began like it and indeed to-day is very seldom like yesterday if people would note the differences even when it rains the princess ran through passage after passage and could not find the stair of the tower  my own suspicion is that she had not gone up high enough and was searching on the second instead of the third floor when she turned to go back she failed equally in her search after the stair  she was lost once more  something made it even worse to bear this time and it was no wonder that she cried again  suddenly it occurred to her that it was after having cried before that she had found her grandmother's stair  she got up at once wiped her eyes and started upon a fresh quest  this time although she did not find what she hoped she found what was next best  she did not come on a stair that went up but she came upon one that went down  it was evidently not the stair she had come up yet it was a good deal better than none so down she went and was singing merrily before she reached the bottom there to her surprise she found herself in the kitchen  although she was not allowed to go there alone her nurse had often taken her and she was a great favourite with the servants  so there was a general rush at her the moment she appeared for every one wanted to have her and the report of where she was soon reached the nurse's ears  she came at once to fetch her but she never suspected how she had got there and the princess kept her own counsel  her failure to find the old lady not only disappointed her but made her very thoughtful  sometimes she came almost to the nurse's opinion that she had dreamed all about her but that fancy never lasted very long  she wondered much whether she should ever see her again and thought it very sad not to have been able to find her when she particularly wanted her  she resolved to say nothing more to her nurse on the subject seeing it was so little in her power to prove her words    chapter 6  the little miner  the next day the great cloud still hung over the mountain and the rain poured like water from a full sponge  the princess was very fond of being out of doors and she nearly cried when she saw that the weather was no better  but the mist was not of such a dark dingy grey there was light in it and as the hours went on it grew brighter and brighter until it was almost too brilliant to look at and late in the afternoon the sun broke out so gloriously that irene clapped her hands crying   'see see lootie  the sun has had his face washed  look how bright he is  do get my hat and let us go out for a walk  oh dear oh dear how happy i am'  lootie was very glad to please the princess  she got her hat and cloak and they set out together for a walk up the mountain for the road was so hard and steep that the water could not rest upon it and it was always dry enough for walking a few minutes after the rain ceased  the clouds were rolling away in broken pieces like great overwoolly sheep whose wool the sun had bleached till it was almost too white for the eyes to bear  between them the sky shone with a deeper and purer blue because of the rain  the trees on the roadside were hung all over with drops which sparkled in the sun like jewels the only things that were no brighter for the rain were the brooks that ran down the mountain they had changed from the clearness of crystal to a muddy brown but what they lost in colour they gained in sound or at least in noise for a brook when it is swollen is not so musical as before  but irene was in raptures with the great brown streams tumbling down everywhere and lootie shared in her delight for she too had been confined to the house for three days  at length she observed that the sun was getting low and said it was time to be going back  she made the remark again and again but every time the princess begged her to go on just a little farther and a little farther reminding her that it was much easier to go downhill and saying that when they did turn they would be at home in a moment so on and on they did go now to look at a group of ferns over whose tops a stream was pouring in a watery arch now to pick a shining stone from a rock by the wayside now to watch the flight of some bird suddenly the shadow of a great mountain peak came up from behind and shot in front of them  when the nurse saw it she started and shook and catching hold of the princess's hand turned and began to run down the hill  'what's all the haste nursie' asked irene running alongside of her  'we must not be out a moment longer'  'but we can't help being out a good many moments longer'  it was too true  the nurse almost cried  they were much too far from home  it was against express orders to be out with the princess one moment after the sun was down and they were nearly a mile up the mountain  if his majesty irene's papa were to hear of it lootie would certainly be dismissed and to leave the princess would break her heart  it was no wonder she ran  but irene was not in the least frightened not knowing anything to be frightened at  she kept on chattering as well as she could but it was not easy  'lootie lootie why do you run so fast  it shakes my teeth when i talk'  'then don't talk' said lootie  'but the princess went on talking  she was always saying  'look look lootie' but lootie paid no more heed to anything she said only ran on  'look look lootie  don't you see that funny man peeping over the rock'  lootie only ran the faster  they had to pass the rock and when they came nearer the princess saw it was only a lump of the rock itself that she had taken for a man  'look look lootie  there's such a curious creature at the foot of that old tree  look at it lootie  it's making faces at us i do think'  lootie gave a stifled cry and ran faster still so fast that irene's little legs could not keep up with her and she fell with a crash  it was a hard downhill road and she had been running very fast so it was no wonder she began to cry  this put the nurse nearly beside herself but all she could do was to run on the moment she got the princess on her feet again  'who's that laughing at me' said the princess trying to keep in her sobs and running too fast for her grazed knees  'nobody child' said the nurse almost angrily  but that instant there came a burst of coarse tittering from somewhere near and a hoarse indistinct voice that seemed to say  'lies lies lies'  'oh' cried the nurse with a sigh that was almost a scream and ran on faster than ever  'nursie lootie i can't run any more  do let us walk a bit'  'what am i to do' said the nurse  'here i will carry you'  she caught her up but found her much too heavy to run with and had to set her down again  then she looked wildly about her gave a great cry and said   'we've taken the wrong turning somewhere and i don't know where we are  we are lost lost'  the terror she was in had quite bewildered her  it was true enough they had lost the way  they had been running down into a little valley in which there was no house to be seen  now irene did not know what good reason there was for her nurse's terror for the servants had all strict orders never to mention the goblins to her but it was very discomposing to see her nurse in such a fright  before however she had time to grow thoroughly alarmed like her she heard the sound of whistling and that revived her  presently she saw a boy coming up the road from the valley to meet them  he was the whistler but before they met his whistling changed to singing and this is something like what he sang     'ring dod bang   go the hammers' clang   hit and turn and bore   whizz and puff and roar   thus we rive the rocks   force the goblin locks    see the shining ore   one two three    bright as gold can be   four five six    shovels mattocks picks   seven eight nine    light your lamp at mine   ten eleven twelve    loosely hold the helve   we're the merry miner-boys   make the goblins hold their noise'   'i wish you would hold your noise' said the nurse rudely for the very word goblin at such a time and in such a place made her tremble  it would bring the goblins upon them to a certainty she thought to defy them in that way  but whether the boy heard her or not he did not stop his singing     'thirteen fourteen fifteen    this is worth the siftin'   sixteen seventeen eighteen    there's the match and lay't in   nineteen twenty    goblins in a plenty'   'do be quiet' cried the nurse in a whispered shriek  but the boy who was now close at hand still went on    'hush scush scurry   there you go in a hurry   gobble gobble goblin   there you go a wobblin'   hobble hobble hobblin'    cobble cobble cobblin'   hob-bob-goblin    huuuuuh'   'there' said the boy as he stood still opposite them  'there that'll do for them  they can't bear singing and they can't stand that song  they can't sing themselves for they have no more voice than a crow and they don't like other people to sing'  the boy was dressed in a miner's dress with a curious cap on his head he was a very nice-looking boy with eyes as dark as the mines in which he worked and as sparkling as the crystals in their rocks  he was about twelve years old  his face was almost too pale for beauty which came of his being so little in the open air and the sunlight for even vegetables grown in the dark are white but he looked happy merry indeed perhaps at the thought of having routed the goblins and his bearing as he stood before them had nothing clownish or rude about it  'i saw them' he went on 'as i came up and i'm very glad i did i knew they were after somebody but i couldn't see who it was they won't touch you so long as i'm with you'  'why who are you' asked the nurse offended at the freedom with which he spoke to them  'i'm peter's son'  'who's peter'  'peter the miner'  'i don't know him' 'i'm his son though'  'and why should the goblins mind you pray'  'because i don't mind them  i'm used to them'  'what difference does that make'  'if you're not afraid of them they're afraid of you  i'm not afraid of them  that's all  but it's all that's wanted up here that is it's a different thing down there  they won't always mind that song even down there  and if anyone sings it they stand grinning at him awfully and if he gets frightened and misses a word or says a wrong one they oh don't they give it him'  'what do they do to him' asked irene with a trembling voice  'don't go frightening the princess' said the nurse  'the princess' repeated the little miner taking off his curious cap 'i beg your pardon but you oughtn't to be out so late everybody knows that's against the law'  'yes indeed it is' said the nurse beginning to cry again  'and i shall have to suffer for it'  'what does that matter' said the boy  'it must be your fault  it is the princess who will suffer for it  i hope they didn't hear you call her the princess  if they did they're sure to know her again  they're awfully sharp'  'lootie lootie' cried the princess  'take me home'  'don't go on like that' said the nurse to the boy almost fiercely 'how could i help it  i lost my way'  'you shouldn't have been out so late  you wouldn't have lost your way if you hadn't been frightened' said the boy  'come along i'll soon set you right again  shall i carry your little highness'  'impertinence' murmured the nurse but she did not say it aloud for she thought if she made him angry he might take his revenge by telling someone belonging to the house and then it would be sure to come to the king's ears  'no thank you' said irene  'i can walk very well though i can't run so fast as nursie  if you will give me one hand lootie will give me another and then i shall get on famously'  they soon had her between them holding a hand of each  'now let's run' said the nurse  'no no' said the little miner  'that's the worst thing you can do if you hadn't run before you would not have lost your way and if you run now they will be after you in a moment'  'i don't want to run' said irene  'you don't think of me' said the nurse  'yes i do lootie  the boy says they won't touch us if we don't run'  'yes but if they know at the house that i've kept you out so late i shall be turned away and that would break my heart'  'turned away lootie  who would turn you away'  'your papa child'  'but i'll tell him it was all my fault  and you know it was lootie'  'he won't mind that  i'm sure he won't'  'then i'll cry and go down on my knees to him and beg him not to take away my own dear lootie'  the nurse was comforted at hearing this and said no more  they went on walking pretty fast but taking care not to run a step  'i want to talk to you' said irene to the little miner 'but it's so awkward  i don't know your name'  'my name's curdie little princess'  'what a funny name curdie  what more'  'curdie peterson  what's your name please'  'irene'  'what more'  'i don't know what more  what more is my name lootie'  'princesses haven't got more than one name  they don't want it'  'oh then curdie you must call me just irene and no more'  'no indeed' said the nurse indignantly  'he shall do no such thing'  'what shall he call me then lootie'  'your royal highness' 'my royal highness  what's that  no no lootie  i won't be called names  i don't like them  you told me once yourself it's only rude children that call names and i'm sure curdie wouldn't be rude  curdie my name's irene'  'well irene' said curdie with a glance at the nurse which showed he enjoyed teasing her 'it is very kind of you to let me call you anything  i like your name very much'  he expected the nurse to interfere again but he soon saw that she was too frightened to speak  she was staring at something a few yards before them in the middle of the path where it narrowed between rocks so that only one could pass at a time  'it is very much kinder of you to go out of your way to take us home' said irene  'i'm not going out of my way yet' said curdie  'it's on the other side of those rocks the path turns off to my father's'  'you wouldn't think of leaving us till we're safe home i'm sure' gasped the nurse  'of course not' said curdie  'you dear good kind curdie  i'll give you a kiss when we get home' said the princess  the nurse gave her a great pull by the hand she held  but at that instant the something in the middle of the way which had looked like a great lump of earth brought down by the rain began to move one after another it shot out four long things like two arms and two legs but it was now too dark to tell what they were  the nurse began to tremble from head to foot  irene clasped curdie's hand yet faster and curdie began to sing again     'one two    hit and hew   three four    blast and bore   five six    there's a fix   seven eight    hold it straight   nine ten    hit again   hurry scurry   bother smother   there's a toad   in the road   smash it   squash it   fry it   dry it   you're another   up and off   there's enough    huuuuuh'   as he uttered the last words curdie let go his hold of his companion and rushed at the thing in the road as if he would trample it under his feet  it gave a great spring and ran straight up one of the rocks like a huge spider  curdie turned back laughing and took irene's hand again  she grasped his very tight but said nothing till they had passed the rocks  a few yards more and she found herself on a part of the road she knew and was able to speak again  'do you know curdie i don't quite like your song  it sounds to me rather rude' she said  'well perhaps it is' answered curdie  'i never thought of that it's a way we have  we do it because they don't like it'  'who don't like it'  'the cobs as we call them'  'don't' said the nurse  'why not' said curdie  'i beg you won't  please don't'  'oh if you ask me that way of course i won't though i don't a bit know why  look there are the lights of your great house down below you'll be at home in five minutes now'  nothing more happened  they reached home in safety  nobody had missed them or even known they had gone out and they arrived at the door belonging to their part of the house without anyone seeing them  the nurse was rushing in with a hurried and not over-gracious good night to curdie but the princess pulled her hand from hers and was just throwing her arms round curdie's neck when she caught her again and dragged her away  'lootie lootie i promised a kiss' cried irene  'a princess mustn't give kisses  it's not at all proper' said lootie  'but i promised' said the princess  'there's no occasion he's only a miner-boy'  'he's a good boy and a brave boy and he has been very kind to us lootie lootie i promised'  'then you shouldn't have promised'  'lootie i promised him a kiss'  'your royal highness' said lootie suddenly grown very respectful 'must come in directly'  'nurse a princess must not break her word' said irene drawing herself up and standing stock-still  lootie did not know which the king might count the worst to let the princess be out after sunset or to let her kiss a miner-boy she did not know that being a gentleman as many kings have been he would have counted neither of them the worse  however much he might have disliked his daughter to kiss the miner-boy he would not have had her break her word for all the goblins in creation but as i say the nurse was not lady enough to understand this and so she was in a great difficulty for if she insisted someone might hear the princess cry and run to see and then all would come out  but here curdie came again to the rescue  'never mind princess irene' he said  'you mustn't kiss me tonight but you shan't break your word  i will come another time  you may be sure i will'  'oh thank you curdie' said the princess and stopped crying  'good night irene good night lootie' said curdie and turned and was out of sight in a moment  'i should like to see him' muttered the nurse as she carried the princess to the nursery  'you will see him' said irene  'you may be sure curdie will keep his word  he's sure to come again'  'i should like to see him' repeated the nurse and said no more she did not want to open a new cause of strife with the princess by saying more plainly what she meant  glad enough that she had succeeded both in getting home unseen and in keeping the princess from kissing the miner's boy she resolved to watch her far better in future  her carelessness had already doubled the danger she was in  formerly the goblins were her only fear now she had to protect her charge from curdie as well    chapter 7  the mines  curdie went home whistling  he resolved to say nothing about the princess for fear of getting the nurse into trouble for while he enjoyed teasing her because of her absurdity he was careful not to do her any harm  he saw no more of the goblins and was soon fast asleep in his bed  he woke in the middle of the night and thought he heard curious noises outside  he sat up and listened then got up and opening the door very quietly went out  when he peeped round the corner he saw under his own window a group of stumpy creatures whom he at once recognized by their shape  hardly however had he begun his 'one two three' when they broke asunder scurried away and were out of sight  he returned laughing got into bed again and was fast asleep in a moment  reflecting a little over the matter in the morning he came to the conclusion that as nothing of the kind had ever happened before they must be annoyed with him for interfering to protect the princess  by the time he was dressed however he was thinking of something quite different for he did not value the enmity of the goblins in the least as soon as they had had breakfast he set off with his father for the mine  they entered the hill by a natural opening under a huge rock where a little stream rushed out  they followed its course for a few yards when the passage took a turn and sloped steeply into the heart of the hill  with many angles and windings and branchings-off and sometimes with steps where it came upon a natural gulf it led them deep into the hill before they arrived at the place where they were at present digging out the precious ore this was of various kinds for the mountain was very rich in the better sorts of metals  with flint and steel and tinder-box they lighted their lamps then fixed them on their heads and were soon hard at work with their pickaxes and shovels and hammers  father and son were at work near each other but not in the same gang the passages out of which the ore was dug they called gangs for when the lode or vein of ore was small one miner would have to dig away alone in a passage no bigger than gave him just room to work sometimes in uncomfortable cramped positions  if they stopped for a moment they could hear everywhere around them some nearer some farther off the sounds of their companions burrowing away in all directions in the inside of the great mountain some boring holes in the rock in order to blow it up with gunpowder others shovelling the broken ore into baskets to be carried to the mouth of the mine others hitting away with their pickaxes sometimes if the miner was in a very lonely part he would hear only a tap-tapping no louder than that of a woodpecker for the sound would come from a great distance off through the solid mountain rock  the work was hard at best for it is very warm underground but it was not particularly unpleasant and some of the miners when they wanted to earn a little more money for a particular purpose would stop behind the rest and work all night  but you could not tell night from day down there except from feeling tired and sleepy for no light of the sun ever came into those gloomy regions  some who had thus remained behind during the night although certain there were none of their companions at work would declare the next morning that they heard every time they halted for a moment to take breath a tap-tapping all about them as if the mountain were then more full of miners than ever it was during the day and some in consequence would never stay overnight for all knew those were the sounds of the goblins  they worked only at night for the miners' night was the goblins' day indeed the greater number of the miners were afraid of the goblins for there were strange stories well known amongst them of the treatment some had received whom the goblins had surprised at their work during the night  the more courageous of them however amongst them peter peterson and curdie who in this took after his father had stayed in the mine all night again and again and although they had several times encountered a few stray goblins had never yet failed in driving them away  as i have indicated already the chief defence against them was verse for they hated verse of every kind and some kinds they could not endure at all  i suspect they could not make any themselves and that was why they disliked it so much  at all events those who were most afraid of them were those who could neither make verses themselves nor remember the verses that other people made for them while those who were never afraid were those who could make verses for themselves for although there were certain old rhymes which were very effectual yet it was well known that a new rhyme if of the right sort was even more distasteful to them and therefore more effectual in putting them to flight  perhaps my readers may be wondering what the goblins could be about working all night long seeing they never carried up the ore and sold it but when i have informed them concerning what curdie learned the very next night they will be able to understand  for curdie had determined if his father would permit him to remain there alone this night and that for two reasons  first he wanted to get extra wages that he might buy a very warm red petticoat for his mother who had begun to complain of the cold of the mountain air sooner than usual this autumn and second he had just a faint hope of finding out what the goblins were about under his window the night before  when he told his father he made no objection for he had great confidence in his boy's courage and resources  'i'm sorry i can't stay with you' said peter 'but i want to go and pay the parson a visit this evening and besides i've had a bit of a headache all day'  'i'm sorry for that father' said curdie  'oh it's not much  you'll be sure to take care of yourself won't you'  'yes father i will  i'll keep a sharp look-out i promise you' curdie was the only one who remained in the mine  about six o'clock the rest went away everyone bidding him good night and telling him to take care of himself for he was a great favourite with them all  'don't forget your rhymes' said one  'no no'answered curdie  'it's no matter if he does' said another 'for he'll only have to make a new one'  'yes  but he mightn't be able to make it fast enough' said another 'and while it was cooking in his head they might take a mean advantage and set upon him'  'i'll do my best' said curdie  'i'm not afraid' 'we all know that' they returned and left him    chapter 8  the goblins  for some time curdie worked away briskly throwing all the ore he had disengaged on one side behind him to be ready for carrying out in the morning  he heard a good deal of goblin-tapping but it all sounded far away in the hill and he paid it little heed  towards midnight he began to feel rather hungry so he dropped his pickaxe got out a lump of bread which in the morning he had laid in a damp hole in the rock sat down on a heap of ore and ate his supper then he leaned back for five minutes' rest before beginning his work again and laid his head against the rock  he had not kept the position for one minute before he heard something which made him sharpen his ears  it sounded like a voice inside the rock after a while he heard it again  it was a goblin voice there could be no doubt about that and this time he could make out the words  'hadn't we better be moving'it said  a rougher and deeper voice replied   'there's no hurry  that wretched little mole won't be through tonight if he work ever so hard  he's not by any means at the thinnest place'  'but you still think the lode does come through into our house' said the first voice  'yes but a good bit farther on than he has got to yet  if he had struck a stroke more to the side just here' said the goblin tapping the very stone as it seemed to curdie against which his head lay 'he would have been through but he's a couple of yards past it now and if he follow the lode it will be a week before it leads him in  you see it back there a long way  still perhaps in case of accident it would be as well to be getting out of this helfer you'll take the great chest  that's your business you know'  'yes dad' said a third voice  'but you must help me to get it on my back  it's awfully heavy you know'  'well it isn't just a bag of smoke i admit  but you're as strong as a mountain helfer'  'you say so dad  i think myself i'm all right  but i could carry ten times as much if it wasn't for my feet'  'that is your weak point i confess my boy' 'ain't it yours too father'  'well to be honest it's a goblin weakness  why they come so soft i declare i haven't an idea'  'specially when your head's so hard you know father'  'yes my boy  the goblin's glory is his head  to think how the fellows up above there have to put on helmets and things when they go fighting ha ha'  'but why don't we wear shoes like them father  i should like it especially when i've got a chest like that on my head'  'well you see it's not the fashion  the king never wears shoes'  'the queen does'  'yes but that's for distinction  the first queen you see i mean the king's first wife wore shoes of course because she came from upstairs and so when she died the next queen would not be inferior to her as she called it and would wear shoes too  it was all pride she is the hardest in forbidding them to the rest of the women'  'i'm sure i wouldn't wear them no not for that i wouldn't' said the first voice which was evidently that of the mother of the family  'i can't think why either of them should'  'didn't i tell you the first was from upstairs' said the other 'that was the only silly thing i ever knew his majesty guilty of why should he marry an outlandish woman like that-one of our natural enemies too'  'i suppose he fell in love with her' 'pooh pooh  he's just as happy now with one of his own people'  'did she die very soon  they didn't tease her to death did they'  'oh dear no  the king worshipped her very footmarks'  'what made her die then  didn't the air agree with her'  'she died when the young prince was born'  'how silly of her  we never do that  it must have been because she wore shoes'  'i don't know that'  'why do they wear shoes up there'  'ah now that's a sensible question and i will answer it  but in order to do so i must first tell you a secret  i once saw the queen's feet'  'without her shoes'  'yes without her shoes'  'no  did you  how was it'  'never you mind how it was  she didn't know i saw them  and what do you think they had toes'  'toes  what's that'  'you may well ask  i should never have known if i had not seen the queen's feet  just imagine the ends of her feet were split up into five or six thin pieces'  'oh horrid  how could the king have fallen in love with her'  'you forget that she wore shoes  that is just why she wore them that is why all the men and women too upstairs wear shoes  they can't bear the sight of their own feet without them'  'ah now i understand  if ever you wish for shoes again helfer i'll hit your feet i will'  'no no mother pray don't'  'then don't you'  'but with such a big box on my head '  a horrid scream followed which curdie interpreted as in reply to a blow from his mother upon the feet of her eldest goblin  'well i never knew so much before' remarked a fourth voice  'your knowledge is not universal quite yet' said the father  'you were only fifty last month  mind you see to the bed and bedding as soon as we've finished our supper we'll be up and going  ha ha ha'  'what are you laughing at husband'  'i'm laughing to think what a mess the miners will find themselves in somewhere before this day ten years'  'why what do you mean'  'oh nothing'  'oh yes you do mean something  you always do mean something'  'it's more than you do then wife' 'that may be but it's not more than i find out you know'  'ha ha  you're a sharp one  what a mother you've got helfer'  'yes father'  'well i suppose i must tell you  they're all at the palace consulting about it tonight and as soon as we've got away from this thin place i'm going there to hear what night they fix upon i should like to see that young ruffian there on the other side struggling in the agonies of '  he dropped his voice so low that curdie could hear only a growl the growl went on in the low bass for a good while as inarticulate as if the goblin's tongue had been a sausage and it was not until his wife spoke again that it rose to its former pitch  'but what shall we do when you are at the palace' she asked  'i will see you safe in the new house i've been digging for you for the last two months  podge you mind the table and chairs  i commit them to your care  the table has seven legs each chair three  i shall require them all at your hands'  after this arose a confused conversation about the various household goods and their transport and curdie heard nothing more that was of any importance  he now knew at least one of the reasons for the constant sound of the goblin hammers and pickaxes at night  they were making new houses for themselves to which they might retreat when the miners should threaten to break into their dwellings  but he had learned two things of far greater importance  the first was that some grievous calamity was preparing and almost ready to fall upon the heads of the miners the second was the one weak point of a goblin's body he had not known that their feet were so tender as he had now reason to suspect  he had heard it said that they had no toes  he had never had opportunity of inspecting them closely enough in the dusk in which they always appeared to satisfy himself whether it was a correct report  indeed he had not been able even to satisfy himself as to whether they had no fingers although that also was commonly said to be the fact  one of the miners indeed who had had more schooling than the rest was wont to argue that such must have been the primordial condition of humanity and that education and handicraft had developed both toes and fingers with which proposition curdie had once heard his father sarcastically agree alleging in support of it the probability that babies' gloves were a traditional remnant of the old state of things while the stockings of all ages no regard being paid in them to the toes pointed in the same direction  but what was of importance was the fact concerning the softness of the goblin feet which he foresaw might be useful to all miners  what he had to do in the meantime however was to discover if possible the special evil design the goblins had now in their heads  although he knew all the gangs and all the natural galleries with which they communicated in the mined part of the mountain he had not the least idea where the palace of the king of the gnomes was otherwise he would have set out at once on the enterprise of discovering what the said design was  he judged and rightly that it must lie in a farther part of the mountain between which and the mine there was as yet no communication  there must be one nearly completed however for it could be but a thin partition which now separated them  if only he could get through in time to follow the goblins as they retreated  a few blows would doubtless be sufficient just where his ear now lay but if he attempted to strike there with his pickaxe he would only hasten the departure of the family put them on their guard and perhaps lose their involuntary guidance  he therefore began to feel the wall with his hands and soon found that some of the stones were loose enough to be drawn out with little noise  laying hold of a large one with both his hands he drew it gently out and let it down softly  'what was that noise' said the goblin father  curdie blew out his light lest it should shine through  'it must be that one miner that stayed behind the rest' said the mother  'no he's been gone a good while  i haven't heard a blow for an hour besides it wasn't like that'  'then i suppose it must have been a stone carried down the brook inside'  'perhaps  it will have more room by and by'  curdie kept quite still  after a little while hearing nothing but the sounds of their preparations for departure mingled with an occasional word of direction and anxious to know whether the removal of the stone had made an opening into the goblins' house he put in his hand to feel  it went in a good way and then came in contact with something soft  he had but a moment to feel it over it was so quickly withdrawn  it was one of the toeless goblin feet  the owner of it gave a cry of fright  'what's the matter helfer' asked his mother  'a beast came out of the wall and licked my foot'  'nonsense  there are no wild beasts in our country' said his father  'but it was father  i felt it'  'nonsense i say  will you malign your native realms and reduce them to a level with the country upstairs  that is swarming with wild beasts of every description'  'but i did feel it father'  'i tell you to hold your tongue  you are no patriot'  curdie suppressed his laughter and lay still as a mouse but no stiller for every moment he kept nibbling away with his fingers at the edges of the hole  he was slowly making it bigger for here the rock had been very much shattered with the blasting  there seemed to be a good many in the family to judge from the mass of confused talk which now and then came through the hole but when all were speaking together and just as if they had bottle-brushes each at least one in their throats it was not easy to make out much that was said  at length he heard once more what the father goblin was saying  'now then' he said 'get your bundles on your backs  here helfer i'll help you up with your chest'  'i wish it was my chest father'  'your turn will come in good time enough  make haste  i must go to the meeting at the palace tonight  when that's over we can come back and clear out the last of the things before our enemies return in the morning  now light your torches and come along what a distinction it is to provide our own light instead of being dependent on a thing hung up in the air a most disagreeable contrivance intended no doubt to blind us when we venture out under its baleful influence  quite glaring and vulgar i call it though no doubt useful to poor creatures who haven't the wit to make light for themselves'  curdie could hardly keep himself from calling through to know whether they made the fire to light their torches by  but a moment's reflection showed him that they would have said they did inasmuch as they struck two stones together and the fire came    chapter 9  the hall of the goblin palace  a sound of many soft feet followed but soon ceased  then curdie flew at the hole like a tiger and tore and pulled  the sides gave way and it was soon large enough for him to crawl through  he would not betray himself by rekindling his lamp but the torches of the retreating company which he found departing in a straight line up a long avenue from the door of their cave threw back light enough to afford him a glance round the deserted home of the goblins  to his surprise he could discover nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary natural cave in the rock upon many of which he had come with the rest of the miners in the progress of their excavations  the goblins had talked of coming back for the rest of their household gear  he saw nothing that would have made him suspect a family had taken shelter there for a single night  the floor was rough and stony the walls full of projecting corners the roof in one place twenty feet high in another endangering his forehead while on one side a stream no thicker than a needle it is true but still sufficient to spread a wide dampness over the wall flowed down the face of the rock  but the troop in front of him was toiling under heavy burdens  he could distinguish helfer now and then in the flickering light and shade with his heavy chest on his bending shoulders while the second brother was almost buried in what looked like a great feather bed  'where do they get the feathers' thought curdie but in a moment the troop disappeared at a turn of the way and it was now both safe and necessary for curdie to follow them lest they should be round the next turning before he saw them again for so he might lose them altogether  he darted after them like a greyhound when he reached the corner and looked cautiously round he saw them again at some distance down another long passage  none of the galleries he saw that night bore signs of the work of man or of goblin either  stalactites far older than the mines hung from their roofs and their floors were rough with boulders and large round stones showing that there water must have once run  he waited again at this corner till they had disappeared round the next and so followed them a long way through one passage after another  the passages grew more and more lofty and were more and more covered in the roof with shining stalactites  it was a strange enough procession which he followed  but the strangest part of it was the household animals which crowded amongst the feet of the goblins  it was true they had no wild animals down there at least they did not know of any but they had a wonderful number of tame ones  i must however reserve any contributions towards the natural history of these for a later position in my story  at length turning a corner too abruptly he had almost rushed into the middle of the goblin family for there they had already set down all their burdens on the floor of a cave considerably larger than that which they had left  they were as yet too breathless to speak else he would have had warning of their arrest  he started back however before anyone saw him and retreating a good way stood watching till the father should come out to go to the palace  before very long both he and his son helfer appeared and kept on in the same direction as before while curdie followed them again with renewed precaution  for a long time he heard no sound except something like the rush of a river inside the rock but at length what seemed the far-off noise of a great shouting reached his ears which however presently ceased  after advancing a good way farther he thought he heard a single voice  it sounded clearer and clearer as he went on until at last he could almost distinguish the words  in a moment or two keeping after the goblins round another corner he once more started back this time in amazement  he was at the entrance of a magnificent cavern of an oval shape once probably a huge natural reservoir of water now the great palace hall of the goblins  it rose to a tremendous height but the roof was composed of such shining materials and the multitude of torches carried by the goblins who crowded the floor lighted up the place so brilliantly that curdie could see to the top quite well  but he had no idea how immense the place was until his eyes had got accustomed to it which was not for a good many minutes the rough projections on the walls and the shadows thrown upwards from them by the torches made the sides of the chamber look as if they were crowded with statues upon brackets and pedestals reaching in irregular tiers from floor to roof the walls themselves were in many parts of gloriously shining substances some of them gorgeously coloured besides which powerfully contrasted with the shadows  curdie could not help wondering whether his rhymes would be of any use against such a multitude of goblins as filled the floor of the hall and indeed felt considerably tempted to begin his shout of 'one two three' but as there was no reason for routing them and much for endeavouring to discover their designs he kept himself perfectly quiet and peering round the edge of the doorway listened with both his sharp ears  at the other end of the hall high above the heads of the multitude was a terrace-like ledge of considerable height caused by the receding of the upper part of the cavern-wall  upon this sat the king and his court  the king on a throne hollowed out of a huge block of green copper ore and his court upon lower seats around it  the king had been making them a speech and the applause which followed it was what curdie had heard  one of the court was now addressing the multitude what he heard him say was to the following effect  'hence it appears that two plans have been for some time together working in the strong head of his majesty for the deliverance of his people  regardless of the fact that we were the first possessors of the regions they now inhabit regardless equally of the fact that we abandoned that region from the loftiest motives regardless also of the self-evident fact that we excel them so far in mental ability as they excel us in stature they look upon us as a degraded race and make a mockery of all our finer feelings  but the time has almost arrived when thanks to his majesty's inventive genius it will be in our power to take a thorough revenge upon them once for all in respect of their unfriendly behaviour'  'may it please your majesty ' cried a voice close by the door which curdie recognized as that of the goblin he had followed  'who is he that interrupts the chancellor' cried another from near the throne  'glump' answered several voices  'he is our trusty subject' said the king himself in a slow and stately voice  'let him come forward and speak'  a lane was parted through the crowd and glump having ascended the platform and bowed to the king spoke as follows   'sire i would have held my peace had i not known that i only knew how near was the moment to which the chancellor had just referred  in all probability before another day is past the enemy will have broken through into my house the partition between being even now not more than a foot in thickness'  'not quite so much' thought curdie to himself  'this very evening i have had to remove my household effects therefore the sooner we are ready to carry out the plan for the execution of which his majesty has been making such magnificent preparations the better  i may just add that within the last few days i have perceived a small outbreak in my dining-room which combined with observations upon the course of the river escaping where the evil men enter has convinced me that close to the spot must be a deep gulf in its channel this discovery will i trust add considerably to the otherwise immense forces at his majesty's disposal'  he ceased and the king graciously acknowledged his speech with a bend of his head whereupon glump after a bow to his majesty slid down amongst the rest of the undistinguished multitude  then the chancellor rose and resumed  'the information which the worthy glump has given us' he said 'might have been of considerable import at the present moment but for that other design already referred to which naturally takes precedence his majesty unwilling to proceed to extremities and well aware that such measures sooner or later result in violent reactions has excogitated a more fundamental and comprehensive measure of which i need say no more  should his majesty be successful as who dares to doubt then a peace all to the advantage of the goblin kingdom will be established for a generation at least rendered absolutely secure by the pledge which his royal highness the prince will have and hold for the good behaviour of her relatives  should his majesty fail which who shall dare even to imagine in his most secret thoughts then will be the time for carrying out with rigour the design to which glump referred and for which our preparations are even now all but completed  the failure of the former will render the latter imperative'  curdie perceiving that the assembly was drawing to a close and that there was little chance of either plan being more fully discovered now thought it prudent to make his escape before the goblins began to disperse and slipped quietly away  there was not much danger of meeting any goblins for all the men at least were left behind him in the palace but there was considerable danger of his taking a wrong turning for he had now no light and had therefore to depend upon his memory and his hands  after he had left behind him the glow that issued from the door of glump's new abode he was utterly without guide so far as his eyes were concerned  he was most anxious to get back through the hole before the goblins should return to fetch the remains of their furniture  it was not that he was in the least afraid of them but as it was of the utmost importance that he should thoroughly discover what the plans they were cherishing were he must not occasion the slightest suspicion that they were watched by a miner  he hurried on feeling his way along the walls of rock  had he not been very courageous he must have been very anxious for he could not but know that if he lost his way it would be the most difficult thing in the world to find it again  morning would bring no light into these regions and towards him least of all who was known as a special rhymester and persecutor could goblins be expected to exercise courtesy  well might he wish that he had brought his lamp and tinder-box with him of which he had not thought when he crept so eagerly after the goblins  he wished it all the more when after a while he found his way blocked up and could get no farther  it was of no use to turn back for he had not the least idea where he had begun to go wrong  mechanically however he kept feeling about the walls that hemmed him in  his hand came upon a place where a tiny stream of water was running down the face of the rock  'what a stupid i am' he said to himself  'i am actually at the end of my journey and there are the goblins coming back to fetch their things' he added as the red glimmer of their torches appeared at the end of the long avenue that led up to the cave  in a moment he had thrown himself on the floor and wriggled backwards through the hole  the floor on the other side was several feet lower which made it easier to get back it was all he could do to lift the largest stone he had taken out of the hole but he did manage to shove it in again  he sat down on the ore-heap and thought  he was pretty sure that the latter plan of the goblins was to inundate the mine by breaking outlets for the water accumulated in the natural reservoirs of the mountain as well as running through portions of it while the part hollowed by the miners remained shut off from that inhabited by the goblins they had had no opportunity of injuring them thus but now that a passage was broken through and the goblins' part proved the higher in the mountain it was clear to curdie that the mine could be destroyed in an hour  water was always the chief danger to which the miners were exposed  they met with a little choke-damp sometimes but never with the explosive firedamp so common in coal-mines  hence they were careful as soon as they saw any appearance of water as the result of his reflections while the goblins were busy in their old home it seemed to curdie that it would be best to build up the whole of this gang filling it with stone and clay or lie so that there should be no smallest channel for the water to get into there was not however any immediate danger for the execution of the goblins' plan was contingent upon the failure of that unknown design which was to take precedence of it and he was most anxious to keep the door of communication open that he might if possible discover what the former plan was  at the same time they could not resume their intermitted labours for the inundation without his finding it out when by putting all hands to the work the one existing outlet might in a single night be rendered impenetrable to any weight of water for by filling the gang entirely up their embankment would be buttressed by the sides of the mountain itself  as soon as he found that the goblins had again retired he lighted his lamp and proceeded to fill the hole he had made with such stones as he could withdraw when he pleased  he then thought it better as he might have occasion to be up a good many nights after this to go home and have some sleep  how pleasant the night air felt upon the outside of the mountain after what he had gone through in the inside of it  he hurried up the hill without meeting a single goblin on the way and called and tapped at the window until he woke his father who soon rose and let him in  he told him the whole story and just as he had expected his father thought it best to work that lode no farther but at the same time to pretend occasionally to be at work there still in order that the goblins might have no suspicions  both father and son then went to bed and slept soundly until the morning    chapter 10  the princess's king-papa  the weather continued fine for weeks and the little princess went out every day  so long a period of fine weather had indeed never been known upon that mountain  the only uncomfortable thing was that her nurse was so nervous and particular about being in before the sun was down that often she would take to her heels when nothing worse than a fleecy cloud crossing the sun threw a shadow on the hillside and many an evening they were home a full hour before the sunlight had left the weather-cock on the stables  if it had not been for such odd behaviour irene would by this time have almost forgotten the goblins  she never forgot curdie but him she remembered for his own sake and indeed would have remembered him if only because a princess never forgets her debts until they are paid  one splendid sunshiny day about an hour after noon irene who was playing on a lawn in the garden heard the distant blast of a bugle she jumped up with a cry of joy for she knew by that particular blast that her father was on his way to see her  this part of the garden lay on the slope of the hill and allowed a full view of the country below so she shaded her eyes with her hand and looked far away to catch the first glimpse of shining armour in a few moments a little troop came glittering round the shoulder of a hill  spears and helmets were sparkling and gleaming banners were flying horses prancing and again came the bugle-blast which was to her like the voice of her father calling across the distance  'irene i'm coming'  on and on they came until she could clearly distinguish the king he rode a white horse and was taller than any of the men with him he wore a narrow circle of gold set with jewels around his helmet and as he came still nearer irene could discern the flashing of the stones in the sun  it was a long time since he had been to see her and her little heart beat faster and faster as the shining troop approached for she loved her king-papa very dearly and was nowhere so happy as in his arms  when they reached a certain point after which she could see them no more from the garden she ran to the gate and there stood till up they came clanging and stamping with one more bright bugle-blast which said  'irene i am come'  by this time the people of the house were all gathered at the gate but irene stood alone in front of them  when the horsemen pulled up she ran to the side of the white horse and held up her arms the king stopped and took her hands  in an instant she was on the saddle and clasped in his great strong arms  i wish i could describe the king so that you could see him in your mind  he had gentle blue eyes but a nose that made him look like an eagle  a long dark beard streaked with silvery lines flowed from his mouth almost to his waist and as irene sat on the saddle and hid her glad face upon his bosom it mingled with the golden hair which her mother had given her and the two together were like a cloud with streaks of the sun woven through it  after he had held her to his heart for a minute he spoke to his white horse and the great beautiful creature which had been prancing so proudly a little while before walked as gently as a lady for he knew he had a little lady on his back through the gate and up to the door of the house  then the king set her on the ground and dismounting took her hand and walked with her into the great hall which was hardly ever entered except when he came to see his little princess  there he sat down with two of his counsellors who had accompanied him to have some refreshment and irene sat on his right hand and drank her milk out of a wooden bowl curiously carved  after the king had eaten and drunk he turned to the princess and said stroking her hair   'now my child what shall we do next'  this was the question he almost always put to her first after their meal together and irene had been waiting for it with some impatience for now she thought she should be able to settle a question which constantly perplexed her  'i should like you to take me to see my great old grandmother'  the king looked grave and said   'what does my little daughter mean'  'i mean the queen irene that lives up in the tower the very old lady you know with the long hair of silver'  the king only gazed at his little princess with a look which she could not understand  'she's got her crown in her bedroom' she went on 'but i've not been in there yet  you know she's there don't you'  'no' said the king very quietly  'then it must all be a dream' said irene  'i half thought it was but i couldn't be sure  now i am sure of it  besides i couldn't find her the next time i went up'  at that moment a snow-white pigeon flew in at an open window and settled upon irene's head  she broke into a merry laugh cowered a little and put up her hands to her head saying   'dear dovey don't peck me  you'll pull out my hair with your long claws if you don't mind'  the king stretched out his hand to take the pigeon but it spread its wings and flew again through the open window when its whiteness made one flash in the sun and vanished  the king laid his hand on his princess's head held it back a little gazed in her face smiled half a smile and sighed half a sigh  'come my child we'll have a walk in the garden together' he said  'you won't come up and see my huge great beautiful grandmother then king-papa' said the princess  'not this time' said the king very gently  'she has not invited me you know and great old ladies like her do not choose to be visited without leave asked and given'  the garden was a very lovely place  being upon a mountainside there were parts in it where the rocks came through in great masses and all immediately about them remained quite wild  tufts of heather grew upon them and other hardy mountain plants and flowers while near them would be lovely roses and lilies and all pleasant garden flowers  this mingling of the wild mountain with the civilized garden was very quaint and it was impossible for any number of gardeners to make such a garden look formal and stiff  against one of these rocks was a garden seat shadowed from the afternoon sun by the overhanging of the rock itself  there was a little winding path up to the top of the rock and on top another seat but they sat on the seat at its foot because the sun was hot and there they talked together of many things  at length the king said   'you were out late one evening irene'  'yes papa  it was my fault and lootie was very sorry'  'i must talk to lootie about it' said the king  'don't speak loud to her please papa' said irene  'she's been so afraid of being late ever since  indeed she has not been naughty  it was only a mistake for once'  'once might be too often' murmured the king to himself as he stroked his child's head  i can't tell you how he had come to know  i am sure curdie had not told him  someone about the palace must have seen them after all  he sat for a good while thinking  there was no sound to be heard except that of a little stream which ran merrily out of an opening in the rock by where they sat and sped away down the hill through the garden  then he rose and leaving irene where she was went into the house and sent for lootie with whom he had a talk that made her cry  when in the evening he rode away upon his great white horse he left six of his attendants behind him with orders that three of them should watch outside the house every night walking round and round it from sunset to sunrise  it was clear he was not quite comfortable about the princess    chapter 11  the old lady's bedroom  nothing more happened worth telling for some time  the autumn came and went by  there were no more flowers in the garden  the wind blew strong and howled among the rocks  the rain fell and drenched the few yellow and red leaves that could not get off the bare branches again and again there would be a glorious morning followed by a pouring afternoon and sometimes for a week together there would be rain nothing but rain all day and then the most lovely cloudless night with the sky all out in full-blown stars not one missing  but the princess could not see much of them for she went to bed early  the winter drew on and she found things growing dreary  when it was too stormy to go out and she had got tired of her toys lootie would take her about the house sometimes to the housekeeper's room where the housekeeper who was a good kind old woman made much of her sometimes to the servants' hall or the kitchen where she was not princess merely but absolute queen and ran a great risk of being spoiled sometimes she would run off herself to the room where the men-at-arms whom the king had left sat and they showed her their arms and accoutrements and did what they could to amuse her  still at times she found it very dreary and often and often wished that her huge great grandmother had not been a dream  one morning the nurse left her with the housekeeper for a while to amuse her she turned out the contents of an old cabinet upon the table the little princess found her treasures queer ancient ornaments and many things the use of which she could not imagine far more interesting than her own toys and sat playing with them for two hours or more  but at length in handling a curious old-fashioned brooch she ran the pin of it into her thumb and gave a little scream with the sharpness of the pain but would have thought little more of it had not the pain increased and her thumb begun to swell  this alarmed the housekeeper greatly  the nurse was fetched the doctor was sent for her hand was poulticed and long before her usual time she was put to bed  the pain still continued and although she fell asleep and dreamed a good many dreams there was the pain always in every dream at last it woke her up  the moon was shining brightly into the room  the poultice had fallen off her hand and it was burning hot  she fancied if she could hold it into the moonlight that would cool it  so she got out of bed without waking the nurse who lay at the other end of the room and went to the window  when she looked out she saw one of the men-at-arms walking in the garden with the moonlight glancing on his armour  she was just going to tap on the window and call him for she wanted to tell him all about it when she bethought herself that that might wake lootie and she would put her into her bed again  so she resolved to go to the window of another room and call him from there  it was so much nicer to have somebody to talk to than to lie awake in bed with the burning pain in her hand  she opened the door very gently and went through the nursery which did not look into the garden to go to the other window but when she came to the foot of the old staircase there was the moon shining down from some window high up and making the worm-eaten oak look very strange and delicate and lovely  in a moment she was putting her little feet one after the other in the silvery path up the stair looking behind as she went to see the shadow they made in the middle of the silver  some little girls would have been afraid to find themselves thus alone in the middle of the night but irene was a princess  as she went slowly up the stair not quite sure that she was not dreaming suddenly a great longing woke up in her heart to try once more whether she could not find the old lady with the silvery hair 'if she is a dream' she said to herself 'then i am the likelier to find her if i am dreaming'  so up and up she went stair after stair until she came to the many rooms all just as she had seen them before  through passage after passage she softly sped comforting herself that if she should lose her way it would not matter much because when she woke she would find herself in her own bed with lootie not far off but as if she had known every step of the way she walked straight to the door at the foot of the narrow stair that led to the tower  'what if i should realreality-really find my beautiful old grandmother up there' she said to herself as she crept up the steep steps  when she reached the top she stood a moment listening in the dark for there was no moon there  yes it was it was the hum of the spinning-wheel  what a diligent grandmother to work both day and night  she tapped gently at the door  'come in irene'said the sweet voice  the princess opened the door and entered  there was the moonlight streaming in at the window and in the middle of the moonlight sat the old lady in her black dress with the white lace and her silvery hair mingling with the moonlight so that you could not have told which was which  'come in irene' she said again  'can you tell me what i am spinning'  'she speaks' thought irene 'just as if she had seen me five minutes ago or yesterday at the farthest  no' she answered 'i don't know what you are spinning  please i thought you were a dream  why couldn't i find you before great-great-grandmother'  'that you are hardly old enough to understand  but you would have found me sooner if you hadn't come to think i was a dream  i will give you one reason though why you couldn't find me  i didn't want you to find me'  'why please'  'because i did not want lootie to know i was here'  'but you told me to tell lootie'  'yes  but i knew lootie would not believe you  if she were to see me sitting spinning here she wouldn't believe me either'  'why'  'because she couldn't  she would rub her eyes and go away and say she felt queer and forget half of it and more and then say it had been all a dream'  'just like me' said irene feeling very much ashamed of herself  'yes a good deal like you but not just like you for you've come again and lootie wouldn't have come again  she would have said no no she had had enough of such nonsense'  'is it naughty of lootie then'  'it would be naughty of you  i've never done anything for lootie'  'and you did wash my face and hands for me' said irene beginning to cry  the old lady smiled a sweet smile and said   'i'm not vexed with you my child nor with lootie either  but i don't want you to say anything more to lootie about me  if she should ask you you must just be silent  but i do not think she will ask you'  all the time they talked the old lady kept on spinning  'you haven't told me yet what i am spinning' she said  'because i don't know  it's very pretty stuff'  it was indeed very pretty stuff  there was a good bunch of it on the distaff attached to the spinning-wheel and in the moonlight it shone like what shall i say it was like  it was not white enough for silver yes it was like silver but shone grey rather than white and glittered only a little  and the thread the old lady drew out from it was so fine that irene could hardly see it 'i am spinning this for you my child'  'for me  what am i to do with it please'  'i will tell you by and by  but first i will tell you what it is it is spider-web of a particular kind  my pigeons bring it me from over the great sea  there is only one forest where the spiders live who make this particular kind the finest and strongest of any  i have nearly finished my present job  what is on the rock now will be enough  i have a week's work there yet though' she added looking at the bunch  'do you work all day and all night too great-great-great-great-grandmother' said the princess thinking to be very polite with so many greats  'i am not quite so great as all that' she answered smiling almost merrily  'if you call me grandmother that will do  no i don't work every night only moonlit nights and then no longer than the moon shines upon my wheel  i shan't work much longer tonight'  'and what will you do next grandmother' 'go to bed  would you like to see my bedroom'  'yes that i should'  'then i think i won't work any longer tonight  i shall be in good time'  the old lady rose and left her wheel standing just as it was  you see there was no good in putting it away for where there was not any furniture there was no danger of being untidy  then she took irene by the hand but it was her bad hand and irene gave a little cry of pain  'my child' said her grandmother 'what is the matter'  irene held her hand into the moonlight that the old lady might see it and told her all about it at which she looked grave  but she only said  'give me your other hand' and having led her out upon the little dark landing opened the door on the opposite side of it  what was irene's surprise to see the loveliest room she had ever seen in her life  it was large and lofty and dome-shaped from the centre hung a lamp as round as a ball shining as if with the brightest moonlight which made everything visible in the room though not so clearly that the princess could tell what many of the things were  a large oval bed stood in the middle with a coverlid of rose colour and velvet curtains all round it of a lovely pale blue  the walls were also blue spangled all over with what looked like stars of silver  the old lady left her and going to a strange-looking cabinet opened it and took out a curious silver casket  then she sat down on a low chair and calling irene made her kneel before her while she looked at her hand  having examined it she opened the casket and took from it a little ointment  the sweetest odour filled the room like that of roses and lilies as she rubbed the ointment gently all over the hot swollen hand  her touch was so pleasant and cool that it seemed to drive away the pain and heat wherever it came  'oh grandmother it is so nice' said irene  'thank you thank you'  then the old lady went to a chest of drawers and took out a large handkerchief of gossamer-like cambric which she tied round her hand  'i don't think i can let you go away tonight' she said  'would you like to sleep with me'  'oh yes yes dear grandmother' said irene and would have clapped her hands forgetting that she could not  'you won't be afraid then to go to bed with such an old woman'  'no  you are so beautiful grandmother'  'but i am very old'  'and i suppose i am very young  you won't mind sleeping with such a very young woman grandmother'  'you sweet little pertness' said the old lady and drew her towards her and kissed her on the forehead and the cheek and the mouth  then she got a large silver basin and having poured some water into it made irene sit on the chair and washed her feet this done she was ready for bed  and oh what a delicious bed it was into which her grandmother laid her  she hardly could have told she was lying upon anything  she felt nothing but the softness  the old lady having undressed herself lay down beside her  'why don't you put out your moon' asked the princess  'that never goes out night or day' she answered  'in the darkest night if any of my pigeons are out on a message they always see my moon and know where to fly to'  'but if somebody besides the pigeons were to see it somebody about the house i mean they would come to look what it was and find you'  'the better for them then' said the old lady  'but it does not happen above five times in a hundred years that anyone does see it  the greater part of those who do take it for a meteor wink their eyes and forget it again  besides nobody could find the room except i pleased  besides again i will tell you a secret if that light were to go out you would fancy yourself lying in a bare garret on a heap of old straw and would not see one of the pleasant things round about you all the time'  'i hope it will never go out' said the princess  'i hope not  but it is time we both went to sleep  shall i take you in my arms'  the little princess nestled close up to the old lady who took her in both her arms and held her close to her bosom  'oh dear this is so nice' said the princess  'i didn't know anything in the world could be so comfortable  i should like to lie here for ever'  'you may if you will' said the old lady  'but i must put you to one trial-not a very hard one i hope  this night week you must come back to me  if you don't i do not know when you may find me again and you will soon want me very much'  'oh please don't let me forget'  'you shall not forget  the only question is whether you will believe i am anywhere whether you will believe i am anything but a dream  you may be sure i will do all i can to help you to come but it will rest with yourself after all  on the night of next friday you must come to me  mind now'  'i will try' said the princess  'then good night' said the old lady and kissed the forehead which lay in her bosom  in a moment more the little princess was dreaming in the midst of the loveliest dreams of summer seas and moonlight and mossy springs and great murmuring trees and beds of wild flowers with such odours as she had never smelled before  but after all no dream could be more lovely than what she had left behind when she fell asleep  in the morning she found herself in her own bed  there was no handkerchief or anything else on her hand only a sweet odour lingered about it  the swelling had all gone down the prick of the brooch had vanished in fact her hand was perfectly well    chapter 12  a short chapter about curdie  curdie spent many nights in the mine  his father and he had taken mrs peterson into the secret for they knew mother could hold her tongue which was more than could be said of all the miners' wives  but curdie did not tell her that every night he spent in the mine part of it went in earning a new red petticoat for her  mrs peterson was such a nice good mother  all mothers are nice and good more or less but mrs peterson was nice and good all more and no less  she made and kept a little heaven in that poor cottage on the high hillside for her husband and son to go home to out of the low and rather dreary earth in which they worked  i doubt if the princess was very much happier even in the arms of her huge great-grandmother than peter and curdie were in the arms of mrs peterson  true her hands were hard and chapped and large but it was with work for them and therefore in the sight of the angels her hands were so much the more beautiful  and if curdie worked hard to get her a petticoat she worked hard every day to get him comforts which he would have missed much more than she would a new petticoat even in winter  not that she and curdie ever thought of how much they worked for each other  that would have spoiled everything  when left alone in the mine curdie always worked on for an hour or two at first following the lode which according to glump would lead at last into the deserted habitation  after that he would set out on a reconnoitring expedition  in order to manage this or rather the return from it better than the first time he had bought a huge ball of fine string having learned the trick from hop-o'-my-thumb whose history his mother had often told him  not that hop-o'-my-thumb had ever used a ball of string i should be sorry to be supposed so far out in my classics but the principle was the same as that of the pebbles the end of this string he fastened to his pickaxe which figured no bad anchor and then with the ball in his hand unrolling it as he went set out in the dark through the natural gangs of the goblins' territory  the first night or two he came upon nothing worth remembering saw only a little of the home-life of the cobs in the various caves they called houses failed in coming upon anything to cast light upon the foregoing design which kept the inundation for the present in the background  but at length i think on the third or fourth night he found partly guided by the noise of their implements a company of evidently the best sappers and miners amongst them hard at work  what were they about  it could not well be the inundation seeing that had in the meantime been postponed to something else  then what was it  he lurked and watched every now and then in the greatest risk of being detected but without success  he had again and again to retreat in haste a proceeding rendered the more difficult that he had to gather up his string as he returned upon its course  it was not that he was afraid of the goblins but that he was afraid of their finding out that they were watched which might have prevented the discovery at which he aimed  sometimes his haste had to be such that when he reached home towards morning his string for lack of time to wind it up as he 'dodged the cobs' would be in what seemed most hopeless entanglement but after a good sleep though a short one he always found his mother had got it right again  there it was wound in a most respectable ball ready for use the moment he should want it  'i can't think how you do it mother' he would say  'i follow the thread' she would answer 'just as you do in the mine' she never had more to say about it but the less clever she was with her words the more clever she was with her hands and the less his mother said the more curdie believed she had to say  but still he had made no discovery as to what the goblin miners were about    chapter 13  the cobs' creatures  about this time the gentlemen whom the king had left behind him to watch over the princess had each occasion to doubt the testimony of his own eyes for more than strange were the objects to which they would bear witness  they were of one sort creatures but so grotesque and misshapen as to be more like a child's drawings upon his slate than anything natural  they saw them only at night while on guard about the house  the testimony of the man who first reported having seen one of them was that as he was walking slowly round the house while yet in the shadow he caught sight of a creature standing on its hind legs in the moonlight with its forefeet upon a window-ledge staring in at the window  its body might have been that of a dog or wolf he thought but he declared on his honour that its head was twice the size it ought to have been for the size of its body and as round as a ball while the face which it turned upon him as it fled was more like one carved by a boy upon the turnip inside which he is going to put a candle than anything else he could think of  it rushed into the garden he sent an arrow after it and thought he must have struck it for it gave an unearthly howl and he could not find his arrow any more than the beast although he searched all about the place where it vanished  they laughed at him until he was driven to hold his tongue and said he must have taken too long a pull at the ale-jug  but before two nights were over he had one to side with him for he too had seen something strange only quite different from that reported by the other  the description the second man gave of the creature he had seen was yet more grotesque and unlikely  they were both laughed at by the rest but night after night another came over to their side until at last there was only one left to laugh at all his companions  two nights more passed and he saw nothing but on the third he came rushing from the garden to the other two before the house in such an agitation that they declared for it was their turn now that the band of his helmet was cracking under his chin with the rising of his hair inside it running with him into that part of the garden which i have already described they saw a score of creatures to not one of which they could give a name and not one of which was like another hideous and ludicrous at once gambolling on the lawn in the moonlight the supernatural or rather subnatural ugliness of their faces the length of legs and necks in some the apparent absence of both or either in others made the spectators although in one consent as to what they saw yet doubtful as i have said of the evidence of their own eyes and ears as well for the noises they made although not loud were as uncouth and varied as their forms and could be described neither as grunts nor squeaks nor roars nor howls nor barks nor yells nor screams nor croaks nor hisses nor mews nor shrieks but only as something like all of them mingled in one horrible dissonance keeping in the shade the watchers had a few moments to recover themselves before the hideous assembly suspected their presence but all at once as if by common consent they scampered off in the direction of a great rock and vanished before the men had come to themselves sufficiently to think of following them  my readers will suspect what these were but i will now give them full information concerning them  they were of course household animals belonging to the goblins whose ancestors had taken their ancestors many centuries before from the upper regions of light into the lower regions of darkness  the original stocks of these horrible creatures were very much the same as the animals now seen about farms and homes in the country with the exception of a few of them which had been wild creatures such as foxes and indeed wolves and small bears which the goblins from their proclivity towards the animal creation had caught when cubs and tamed  but in the course of time all had undergone even greater changes than had passed upon their owners  they had altered that is their descendants had altered into such creatures as i have not attempted to describe except in the vaguest manner the various parts of their bodies assuming in an apparently arbitrary and self-willed manner the most abnormal developments indeed so little did any distinct type predominate in some of the bewildering results that you could only have guessed at any known animal as the original and even then what likeness remained would be more one of general expression than of definable conformation  but what increased the gruesomeness tenfold was that from constant domestic or indeed rather family association with the goblins their countenances had grown in grotesque resemblance to the human  no one understands animals who does not see that every one of them even amongst the fishes it may be with a dimness and vagueness infinitely remote yet shadows the human  in the case of these the human resemblance had greatly increased  while their owners had sunk towards them they had risen towards their owners  but the conditions of subterranean life being equally unnatural for both while the goblins were worse the creatures had not improved by the approximation and its result would have appeared far more ludicrous than consoling to the warmest lover of animal nature  i shall now explain how it was that just then these animals began to show themselves about the king's country house  the goblins as curdie had discovered were mining on at work both day and night in divisions urging the scheme after which he lay in wait in the course of their tunnelling they had broken into the channel of a small stream but the break being in the top of it no water had escaped to interfere with their work  some of the creatures hovering as they often did about their masters had found the hole and had with the curiosity which had grown to a passion from the restraints of their unnatural circumstances proceeded to explore the channel  the stream was the same which ran out by the seat on which irene and her king-papa had sat as i have told and the goblin creatures found it jolly fun to get out for a romp on a smooth lawn such as they had never seen in all their poor miserable lives  but although they had partaken enough of the nature of their owners to delight in annoying and alarming any of the people whom they met on the mountain they were of course incapable of designs of their own or of intentionally furthering those of their masters  for several nights after the men-at-arms were at length of one mind as to the fact of the visits of some horrible creatures whether bodily or spectral they could not yet say they watched with special attention that part of the garden where they had last seen them  perhaps indeed they gave in consequence too little attention to the house  but the creatures were too cunning to be easily caught nor were the watchers quick-eyed enough to descry the head or the keen eyes in it which from the opening whence the stream issued would watch them in turn ready the moment they should leave the lawn to report the place clear    chapter 14  that night week  during the whole of the week irene had been thinking every other moment of her promise to the old lady although even now she could not feel quite sure that she had not been dreaming  could it really be that an old lady lived up in the top of the house with pigeons and a spinning-wheel and a lamp that never went out  she was however none the less determined on the coming friday to ascend the three stairs walk through the passages with the many doors and try to find the tower in which she had either seen or dreamed her grandmother  her nurse could not help wondering what had come to the child she would sit so thoughtfully silent and even in the midst of a game with her would so suddenly fall into a dreamy mood  but irene took care to betray nothing whatever efforts lootie might make to get at her thoughts  and lootie had to say to herself  'what an odd child she is' and give it up  at length the longed-for friday arrived and lest lootie should be moved to watch her irene endeavoured to keep herself as quiet as possible  in the afternoon she asked for her doll's house and went on arranging and rearranging the various rooms and their inhabitants for a whole hour  then she gave a sigh and threw herself back in her chair one of the dolls would not sit and another would not stand and they were all very tiresome  indeed there was one would not even lie down which was too bad  but it was now getting dark and the darker it got the more excited irene became and the more she felt it necessary to be composed  'i see you want your tea princess' said the nurse  'i will go and get it  the room feels close  i will open the window a little the evening is mild  it won't hurt you'  'there's no fear of that lootie' said irene wishing she had put off going for the tea till it was darker when she might have made her attempt with every advantage  i fancy lootie was longer in returning than she had intended for when irene who had been lost in thought looked up she saw it was nearly dark and at the same moment caught sight of a pair of eyes bright with a green light glowering at her through the open window  the next instant something leaped into the room  it was like a cat with legs as long as a horse's irene said but its body no bigger and its legs no thicker than those of a cat  she was too frightened to cry out but not too frightened to jump from her chair and run from the room  it is plain enough to every one of my readers what she ought to have done and indeed irene thought of it herself but when she came to the foot of the old stair just outside the nursery door she imagined the creature running up those long ascents after her and pursuing her through the dark passages which after all might lead to no tower that thought was too much  her heart failed her and turning from the stair she rushed along to the hall whence finding the front door open she darted into the court pursued at least she thought so by the creature  no one happening to see her on she ran unable to think for fear and ready to run anywhere to elude the awful creature with the stilt-legs  not daring to look behind her she rushed straight out of the gate and up the mountain  it was foolish indeed thus to run farther and farther from all who could help her as if she had been seeking a fit spot for the goblin creature to eat her in his leisure but that is the way fear serves us  it always sides with the thing we are afraid of  the princess was soon out of breath with running uphill but she ran on for she fancied the horrible creature just behind her forgetting that had it been after her such long legs as those must have overtaken her long ago  at last she could run no longer and fell unable even to scream by the roadside where she lay for some time half dead with terror  but finding nothing lay hold of her and her breath beginning to come back she ventured at length to get half up and peer anxiously about her  it was now so dark she could see nothing  not a single star was out  she could not even tell in what direction the house lay and between her and home she fancied the dreadful creature lying ready to pounce upon her she saw now that she ought to have run up the stairs at once  it was well she did not scream for although very few of the goblins had come out for weeks a stray idler or two might have heard her she sat down upon a stone and nobody but one who had done something wrong could have been more miserable  she had quite forgotten her promise to visit her grandmother  a raindrop fell on her face  she looked up and for a moment her terror was lost in astonishment  at first she thought the rising moon had left her place and drawn nigh to see what could be the matter with the little girl sitting alone without hat or cloak on the dark bare mountain but she soon saw she was mistaken for there was no light on the ground at her feet and no shadow anywhere  but a great silver globe was hanging in the air and as she gazed at the lovely thing her courage revived  if she were but indoors again she would fear nothing not even the terrible creature with the long legs  but how was she to find her way back  what could that light be  could it be  no it couldn't  but what if it should be yes it must be her great-great-grandmother's lamp which guided her pigeons home through the darkest night  she jumped up  she had but to keep that light in view and she must find the house  her heart grew strong  speedily yet softly she walked down the hill hoping to pass the watching creature unseen  dark as it was there was little danger now of choosing the wrong road  and which was most strange the light that filled her eyes from the lamp instead of blinding them for a moment to the object upon which they next fell enabled her for a moment to see it despite the darkness  by looking at the lamp and then dropping her eyes she could see the road for a yard or two in front of her and this saved her from several falls for the road was very rough  but all at once to her dismay it vanished and the terror of the beast which had left her the moment she began to return again laid hold of her heart  the same instant however she caught the light of the windows and knew exactly where she was  it was too dark to run but she made what haste she could and reached the gate in safety  she found the house door still open ran through the hall and without even looking into the nursery bounded straight up the stair and the next and the next then turning to the right ran through the long avenue of silent rooms and found her way at once to the door at the foot of the tower stair  when first the nurse missed her she fancied she was playing her a trick and for some time took no trouble about her but at last getting frightened she had begun to search and when the princess entered the whole household was hither and thither over the house hunting for her  a few seconds after she reached the stair of the tower they had even begun to search the neglected rooms in which they would never have thought of looking had they not already searched every other place they could think of in vain  but by this time she was knocking at the old lady's door    chapter 15  woven and then spun  'come in irene' said the silvery voice of her grandmother  the princess opened the door and peeped in  but the room was quite dark and there was no sound of the spinning-wheel  she grew frightened once more thinking that although the room was there the old lady might be a dream after all  every little girl knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she thought somebody was but irene had to fancy for a moment that the person she came to find was nowhere at all she remembered however that at night she spun only in the moonlight and concluded that must be why there was no sweet bee-like humming  the old lady might be somewhere in the darkness  before she had time to think another thought she heard her voice again saying as before  'come in irene'  from the sound she understood at once that she was not in the room beside her  perhaps she was in her bedroom  she turned across the passage feeling her way to the other door  when her hand fell on the lock again the old lady spoke   'shut the other door behind you irene  i always close the door of my workroom when i go to my chamber'  irene wondered to hear her voice so plainly through the door  having shut the other she opened it and went in  oh what a lovely haven to reach from the darkness and fear through which she had come  the soft light made her feel as if she were going into the heart of the milkiest pearl while the blue walls and their silver stars for a moment perplexed her with the fancy that they were in reality the sky which she had left outside a minute ago covered with rainclouds  'i've lighted a fire for you irene  you're cold and wet' said her grandmother  then irene looked again and saw that what she had taken for a huge bouquet of red roses on a low stand against the wall was in fact a fire which burned in the shapes of the loveliest and reddest roses glowing gorgeously between the heads and wings of two cherubs of shining silver  and when she came nearer she found that the smell of roses with which the room was filled came from the fire-roses on the hearth her grandmother was dressed in the loveliest pale blue velvet over which her hair no longer white but of a rich golden colour streamed like a cataract here falling in dull gathered heaps there rushing away in smooth shining falls  and ever as she looked the hair seemed pouring down from her head and vanishing in a golden mist ere it reached the floor  it flowed from under the edge of a circle of shining silver set with alternated pearls and opals  on her dress was no ornament whatever neither was there a ring on her hand or a necklace or carcanet about her neck  but her slippers glimmered with the light of the milky way for they were covered with seed-pearls and opals in one mass  her face was that of a woman of three-and-twenty  the princess was so bewildered with astonishment and admiration that she could hardly thank her and drew nigh with timidity feeling dirty and uncomfortable  the lady was seated on a low chair by the side of the fire with hands outstretched to take her but the princess hung back with a troubled smile  'why what's the matter' asked her grandmother  'you haven't been doing anything wrong i know that by your face though it is rather miserable  what's the matter my dear'  and she still held out her arms  'dear grandmother' said irene 'i'm not so sure that i haven't done something wrong  i ought to have run up to you at once when the long-legged cat came in at the window instead of running out on the mountain and making myself such a fright'  'you were taken by surprise my child and you are not so likely to do it again  it is when people do wrong things wilfully that they are the more likely to do them again  come'  and still she held out her arms  'but grandmother you're so beautiful and grand with your crown on and i am so dirty with mud and rain  i should quite spoil your beautiful blue dress'  with a merry little laugh the lady sprung from her chair more lightly far than irene herself could caught the child to her bosom and kissing the tear-stained face over and over sat down with her in her lap  'oh grandmother  you'll make yourself such a mess' cried irene clinging to her  'you darling do you think i care more for my dress than for my little girl  besides look here'  as she spoke she set her down and irene saw to her dismay that the lovely dress was covered with the mud of her fall on the mountain road but the lady stooped to the fire and taking from it by the stalk in her fingers one of the burning roses passed it once and again and a third time over the front of her dress and when irene looked not a single stain was to be discovered  'there' said her grandmother 'you won't mind coming to me now'  but irene again hung back eying the flaming rose which the lady held in her hand  'you're not afraid of the rose are you' she said about to throw it on the hearth again  'oh don't please' cried irene  'won't you hold it to my frock and my hands and my face  and i'm afraid my feet and my knees want it too'  'no answered her grandmother smiling a little sadly as she threw the rose from her 'it is too hot for you yet  it would set your frock in a flame  besides i don't want to make you clean tonight  i want your nurse and the rest of the people to see you as you are for you will have to tell them how you ran away for fear of the long-legged cat  i should like to wash you but they would not believe you then do you see that bath behind you'  the princess looked and saw a large oval tub of silver shining brilliantly in the light of the wonderful lamp  'go and look into it' said the lady  irene went and came back very silent with her eyes shining  'what did you see' asked her grandmother  'the sky and the moon and the stars' she answered  'it looked as if there was no bottom to it'  the lady smiled a pleased satisfied smile and was silent also for a few moments  then she said   'any time you want a bath come to me  i know you have a bath every morning but sometimes you want one at night too'  'thank you grandmother i will i will indeed' answered irene and was again silent for some moments thinking  then she said  'how was it grandmother that i saw your beautiful lamp not the light of it only but the great round silvery lamp itself hanging alone in the great open air high up  it was your lamp i saw wasn't it'  'yes my child it was my lamp'  'then how was it  i don't see a window all round'  'when i please i can make the lamp shine through the walls shine so strong that it melts them away from before the sight and shows itself as you saw it  but as i told you it is not everybody can see it'  'how is it that i can then  i'm sure i don't know'  'it is a gift born with you  and one day i hope everybody will have it'  'but how do you make it shine through the walls'  'ah that you would not understand if i were to try ever so much to make you not yet not yet  but' added the lady rising 'you must sit in my chair while i get you the present i have been preparing for you  i told you my spinning was for you  it is finished now and i am going to fetch it  i have been keeping it warm under one of my brooding pigeons'  irene sat down in the low chair and her grandmother left her shutting the door behind her  the child sat gazing now at the rose fire now at the starry walls now at the silver light and a great quietness grew in her heart  if all the long-legged cats in the world had come rushing at her then she would not have been afraid of them for a moment  how this was she could not tell she only knew there was no fear in her and everything was so right and safe that it could not get in  she had been gazing at the lovely lamp for some minutes fixedly  turning her eyes she found the wall had vanished for she was looking out on the dark cloudy night  but though she heard the wind blowing none of it blew upon her  in a moment more the clouds themselves parted or rather vanished like the wall and she looked straight into the starry herds flashing gloriously in the dark blue  it was but for a moment  the clouds gathered again and shut out the stars the wall gathered again and shut out the clouds and there stood the lady beside her with the loveliest smile on her face and a shimmering ball in her hand about the size of a pigeon's egg  'there irene there is my work for you' she said holding out the ball to the princess  she took it in her hand and looked at it all over  it sparkled a little and shone here and there but not much  it was of a sort of grey-whiteness something like spun glass  'is this all your spinning grandmother' she asked  'all since you came to the house  there is more there than you think'  'how pretty it is  what am i to do with it please'  'that i will now explain to you' answered the lady turning from her and going to her cabinet  she came back with a small ring in her hand then she took the ball from irene's and did something with the ring irene could not tell what  'give me your hand' she said  irene held up her right hand  'yes that is the hand i want' said the lady and put the ring on the forefinger of it  'what a beautiful ring' said irene  'what is the stone called'  'it is a fire-opal' 'please am i to keep it'  'always' 'oh thank you grandmother  it's prettier than anything i ever saw except those of all colours-in your please is that your crown'  'yes it is my crown  the stone in your ring is of the same sort only not so good  it has only red but mine have all colours you see'  'yes grandmother  i will take such care of it  but ' she added hesitating  'but what' asked her grandmother  'what am i to say when lootie asks me where i got it'  'you will ask her where you got it' answered the lady smiling  'i don't see how i can do that'  'you will though'  'of course i will if you say so  but you know i can't pretend not to know'  'of course not  but don't trouble yourself about it  you will see when the time comes'  so saying the lady turned and threw the little ball into the rose fire  'oh grandmother' exclaimed irene 'i thought you had spun it for me'  'so i did my child  and you've got it'  'no it's burnt in the fire'  the lady put her hand in the fire brought out the ball glimmering as before and held it towards her  irene stretched out her hand to take it but the lady turned and going to her cabinet opened a drawer and laid the ball in it  'have i done anything to vex you grandmother' said irene pitifully  'no my darling  but you must understand that no one ever gives anything to another properly and really without keeping it  that ball is yours'  'oh i'm not to take it with me  you are going to keep it for me'  'you are to take it with you  i've fastened the end of it to the ring on your finger'  irene looked at the ring  'i can't see it there grandmother' she said  'feel a little way from the ring towards the cabinet' said the lady  'oh i do feel it' exclaimed the princess  'but i can't see it' she added looking close to her outstretched hand  'no  the thread is too fine for you to see it  you can only feel it now you can fancy how much spinning that took although it does seem such a little ball'  'but what use can i make of it if it lies in your cabinet'  'that is what i will explain to you  it would be of no use to you it wouldn't be yours at all if it did not lie in my cabinet  now listen if ever you find yourself in any danger such for example as you were in this same evening you must take off your ring and put it under the pillow of your bed  then you must lay your finger the same that wore the ring upon the thread and follow the thread wherever it leads you'  'oh how delightful  it will lead me to you grandmother i know'  'yes  but remember it may seem to you a very roundabout way indeed and you must not doubt the thread  of one thing you may be sure that while you hold it i hold it too'  'it is very wonderful' said irene thoughtfully  then suddenly becoming aware she jumped up crying   'oh grandmother here have i been sitting all this time in your chair and you standing  i beg your pardon'  the lady laid her hand on her shoulder and said   'sit down again irene  nothing pleases me better than to see anyone sit in my chair  i am only too glad to stand so long as anyone will sit in it'  'how kind of you' said the princess and sat down again  'it makes me happy' said the lady  'but' said irene still puzzled 'won't the thread get in somebody's way and be broken if the one end is fast to my ring and the other laid in your cabinet'  'you will find all that arrange itself  i am afraid it is time for you to go'  'mightn't i stay and sleep with you tonight grandmother' 'no not tonight  if i had meant you to stay tonight i should have given you a bath but you know everybody in the house is miserable about you and it would be cruel to keep them so all night  you must go downstairs'  'i'm so glad grandmother you didn't say go home for this is my home  mayn't i call this my home'  'you may my child  and i trust you will always think it your home now come  i must take you back without anyone seeing you'  'please i want to ask you one question more' said irene  'is it because you have your crown on that you look so young'  'no child' answered her grandmother 'it is because i felt so young this evening that i put my crown on  and i thought you would like to see your old grandmother in her best'  'why do you call yourself old  you're not old grandmother'  'i am very old indeed  it is so silly of people i don't mean you for you are such a tiny and couldn't know better but it is so silly of people to fancy that old age means crookedness and witheredness and feebleness and sticks and spectacles and rheumatism and forgetfulness it is so silly old age has nothing whatever to do with all that  the right old age means strength and beauty and mirth and courage and clear eyes and strong painless limbs  i am older than you are able to think and '  'and look at you grandmother' cried irene jumping up and flinging her arms about her neck  'i won't be so silly again i promise you at least i'm rather afraid to promise but if i am i promise to be sorry for it i do  i wish i were as old as you grandmother  i don't think you are ever afraid of anything'  'not for long at least my child  perhaps by the time i am two thousand years of age i shall indeed never be afraid of anything but i confess i have sometimes been afraid about my children sometimes about you irene'  'oh i'm so sorry grandmother  tonight i suppose you mean'  'yes a little tonight but a good deal when you had all but made up your mind that i was a dream and no real great-great-grandmother  you must not suppose i am blaming you for that  i dare say you could not help it'  'i don't know grandmother' said the princess beginning to cry 'i can't always do myself as i should like  and i don't always try  i'm very sorry anyhow'  the lady stooped lifted her in her arms and sat down with her in her chair holding her close to her bosom  in a few minutes the princess had sobbed herself to sleep  how long she slept i do not know  when she came to herself she was sitting in her own high chair at the nursery table with her doll's house before her    chapter 16  the ring  the same moment her nurse came into the room sobbing  when she saw her sitting there she started back with a loud cry of amazement and joy  then running to her she caught her in her arms and covered her with kisses  'my precious darling princess where have you been  what has happened to you  we've all been crying our eyes out and searching the house from top to bottom for you'  'not quite from the top' thought irene to herself and she might have added 'not quite to the bottom' perhaps if she had known all  but the one she would not and the other she could not say 'oh lootie i've had such a dreadful adventure' she replied and told her all about the cat with the long legs and how she ran out upon the mountain and came back again  but she said nothing of her grandmother or her lamp  'and there we've been searching for you all over the house for more than an hour and a half' exclaimed the nurse  'but that's no matter now we've got you  only princess i must say' she added her mood changing 'what you ought to have done was to call for your own lootie to come and help you instead of running out of the house and up the mountain in that wild i must say foolish fashion'  'well lootie' said irene quietly 'perhaps if you had a big cat all legs running at you you might not exactly know what was the wisest thing to do at the moment'  'i wouldn't run up the mountain anyhow' returned lootie  'not if you had time to think about it  but when those creatures came at you that night on the mountain you were so frightened yourself that you lost your way home'  this put a stop to lootie's reproaches  she had been on the point of saying that the long-legged cat must have been a twilight fancy of the princess's but the memory of the horrors of that night and of the talking-to which the king had given her in consequence prevented her from saying what after all she did not half believe having a strong suspicion that the cat was a goblin for she knew nothing of the difference between the goblins and their creatures  she counted them all just goblins  without another word she went and got some fresh tea and bread and butter for the princess  before she returned the whole household headed by the housekeeper burst into the nursery to exult over their darling  the gentlemen-at-arms followed and were ready enough to believe all she told them about the long-legged cat indeed though wise enough to say nothing about it they remembered with no little horror just such a creature amongst those they had surprised at their gambols upon the princess's lawn  in their own hearts they blamed themselves for not having kept better watch  and their captain gave orders that from this night the front door and all the windows on the ground floor should be locked immediately the sun set and opened after upon no pretence whatever the men-at-arms redoubled their vigilance and for some time there was no further cause of alarm  when the princess woke the next morning her nurse was bending over her  'how your ring does glow this morning princess just like a fiery rose' she said  'does it lootie' returned irene  'who gave me the ring lootie i know i've had it a long time but where did i get it  i don't remember'  'i think it must have been your mother gave it you princess but really for as long as you have worn it i don't remember that ever i heard' answered her nurse  'i will ask my king-papa the next time he comes' said irene    chapter 17  springtime  the spring so dear to all creatures young and old came at last and before the first few days of it had gone the king rode through its budding valleys to see his little daughter  he had been in a distant part of his dominions all the winter for he was not in the habit of stopping in one great city or of visiting only his favourite country houses but he moved from place to place that all his people might know him  wherever he journeyed he kept a constant look-out for the ablest and best men to put into office and wherever he found himself mistaken and those he had appointed incapable or unjust he removed them at once  hence you see it was his care of the people that kept him from seeing his princess so often as he would have liked  you may wonder why he did not take her about with him but there were several reasons against his doing so and i suspect her great-great-grandmother had had a principal hand in preventing it  once more irene heard the bugle-blast and once more she was at the gate to meet her father as he rode up on his great white horse  after they had been alone for a little while she thought of what she had resolved to ask him  'please king-papa' she said 'will you tell me where i got this pretty ring  i can't remember'  the king looked at it  a strange beautiful smile spread like sunshine over his face and an answering smile but at the same time a questioning one spread like moonlight over irene's  'it was your queen-mamma's once' he said  'and why isn't it hers now' asked irene  'she does not want it now' said the king looking grave  'why doesn't she want it now'  'because she's gone where all those rings are made'  'and when shall i see her' asked the princess  'not for some time yet' answered the king and the tears came into his eyes  irene did not remember her mother and did not know why her father looked so and why the tears came in his eyes but she put her arms round his neck and kissed him and asked no more questions  the king was much disturbed on hearing the report of the gentlemen-at-arms concerning the creatures they had seen and i presume would have taken irene with him that very day but for what the presence of the ring on her finger assured him of  about an hour before he left irene saw him go up the old stair and he did not come down again till they were just ready to start and she thought with herself that he had been up to see the old lady  when he went away he left other six gentlemen behind him that there might be six of them always on guard  and now in the lovely spring weather irene was out on the mountain the greater part of the day  in the warmer hollows there were lovely primroses and not so many that she ever got tired of them  as often as she saw a new one opening an eye of light in the blind earth she would clap her hands with gladness and unlike some children i know instead of pulling it would touch it as tenderly as if it had been a new baby and having made its acquaintance would leave it as happy as she found it  she treated the plants on which they grew like birds' nests every fresh flower was like a new little bird to her  she would pay visits to all the flower-nests she knew remembering each by itself  she would go down on her hands and knees beside one and say  'good morning  are you all smelling very sweet this morning good-bye' and then she would go to another nest and say the same  it was a favourite amusement with her  there were many flowers up and down and she loved them all but the primroses were her favourites  'they're not too shy and they're not a bit forward' she would say to lootie  there were goats too about over the mountain and when the little kids came she was as pleased with them as with the flowers  the goats belonged to the miners mostly-a few of them to curdie's mother but there were a good many wild ones that seemed to belong to nobody these the goblins counted theirs and it was upon them partly that they lived  they set snares and dug pits for them and did not scruple to take what tame ones happened to be caught but they did not try to steal them in any other manner because they were afraid of the dogs the hill-people kept to watch them for the knowing dogs always tried to bite their feet  but the goblins had a kind of sheep of their own very queer creatures which they drove out to feed at night and the other goblin creatures were wise enough to keep good watch over them for they knew they should have their bones by and by    chapter 18  curdie's clue  curdie was as watchful as ever but was almost getting tired of his ill success  every other night or so he followed the goblins about as they went on digging and boring and getting as near them as he could watched them from behind stones and rocks but as yet he seemed no nearer finding out what they had in view  as at first he always kept hold of the end of his string while his pickaxe left just outside the hole by which he entered the goblins' country from the mine continued to serve as an anchor and hold fast the other end  the goblins hearing no more noise in that quarter had ceased to apprehend an immediate invasion and kept no watch  one night after dodging about and listening till he was nearly falling asleep with weariness he began to roll up his ball for he had resolved to go home to bed  it was not long however before he began to feel bewildered  one after another he passed goblin houses caves that is occupied by goblin families and at length was sure they were many more than he had passed as he came  he had to use great caution to pass unseen they lay so close together could his string have led him wrong  he still followed winding it and still it led him into more thickly populated quarters until he became quite uneasy and indeed apprehensive for although he was not afraid of the cobs he was afraid of not finding his way out but what could he do  it was of no use to sit down and wait for the morning the morning made no difference here  it was dark and always dark and if his string failed him he was helpless  he might even arrive within a yard of the mine and never know it seeing he could do nothing better he would at least find where the end of his string was and if possible how it had come to play him such a trick  he knew by the size of the ball that he was getting pretty near the last of it when he began to feel a tugging and pulling at it  what could it mean  turning a sharp corner he thought he heard strange sounds  these grew as he went on to a scuffling and growling and squeaking and the noise increased until turning a second sharp corner he found himself in the midst of it and the same moment tumbled over a wallowing mass which he knew must be a knot of the cobs' creatures  before he could recover his feet he had caught some great scratches on his face and several severe bites on his legs and arms  but as he scrambled to get up his hand fell upon his pickaxe and before the horrid beasts could do him any serious harm he was laying about with it right and left in the dark the hideous cries which followed gave him the satisfaction of knowing that he had punished some of them pretty smartly for their rudeness and by their scampering and their retreating howls he perceived that he had routed them  he stood for a little weighing his battle-axe in his hand as if it had been the most precious lump of metal but indeed no lump of gold itself could have been so precious at the time as that common tool then untied the end of the string from it put the ball in his pocket and still stood thinking  it was clear that the cobs' creatures had found his axe had between them carried it off and had so led him he knew not where  but for all his thinking he could not tell what he ought to do until suddenly he became aware of a glimmer of light in the distance  without a moment's hesitation he set out for it as fast as the unknown and rugged way would permit  yet again turning a corner led by the dim light he spied something quite new in his experience of the underground regions a small irregular shape of something shining  going up to it he found it was a piece of mica or muscovy glass called sheep-silver in scotland and the light flickered as if from a fire behind it  after trying in vain for some time to discover an entrance to the place where it was burning he came at length to a small chamber in which an opening high in the wall revealed a glow beyond  to this opening he managed to scramble up and then he saw a strange sight  below sat a little group of goblins around a fire the smoke of which vanished in the darkness far aloft  the sides of the cave were full of shining minerals like those of the palace hall and the company was evidently of a superior order for every one wore stones about head or arms or waist shining dull gorgeous colours in the light of the fire nor had curdie looked long before he recognized the king himself and found that he had made his way into the inner apartment of the royal family  he had never had such a good chance of hearing something  he crept through the hole as softly as he could scrambled a good way down the wall towards them without attracting attention and then sat down and listened the king evidently the queen and probably the crown prince and the prime minister were talking together  he was sure of the queen by her shoes for as she warmed her feet at the fire he saw them quite plainly  'that will be fun' said the one he took for the crown prince it was the first whole sentence he heard  'i don't see why you should think it such a grand affair' said his stepmother tossing her head backward  'you must remember my spouse' interposed his majesty as if making excuse for his son 'he has got the same blood in him  his mother '  'don't talk to me of his mother  you positively encourage his unnatural fancies  whatever belongs to that mother ought to be cut out of him'  'you forget yourself my dear' said the king  'i don't' said the queen 'nor you either  if you expect me to approve of such coarse tastes you will find yourself mistaken  i don't wear shoes for nothing'  'you must acknowledge however' the king said with a little groan 'that this at least is no whim of harelip's but a matter of state policy  you are well aware that his gratification comes purely from the pleasure of sacrificing himself to the public good  does it not harelip'  'yes father of course it does  only it will be nice to make her cry i'll have the skin taken off between her toes and tie them up till they grow together  then her feet will be like other people's and there will be no occasion for her to wear shoes'  'do you mean to insinuate i've got toes you unnatural wretch' cried the queen and she moved angrily towards harelip  the councillor however who was betwixt them leaned forward so as to prevent her touching him but only as if to address the prince  'your royal highness' he said 'possibly requires to be reminded that you have got three toes yourself one on one foot two on the other'  'ha ha ha' shouted the queen triumphantly  the councillor encouraged by this mark of favour went on  'it seems to me your royal highness it would greatly endear you to your future people proving to them that you are not the less one of themselves that you had the misfortune to be born of a sun-mother if you were to command upon yourself the comparatively slight operation which in a more extended form you so wisely meditate with regard to your future princess'  'ha ha ha' laughed the queen louder than before and the king and the minister joined in the laugh  harelip growled and for a few moments the others continued to express their enjoyment of his discomfiture  the queen was the only one curdie could see with any distinctness she sat sideways to him and the light of the fire shone full upon her face  he could not consider her handsome  her nose was certainly broader at the end than its extreme length and her eyes instead of being horizontal were set up like two perpendicular eggs one on the broad the other on the small end  her mouth was no bigger than a small buttonhole until she laughed when it stretched from ear to ear only to be sure her ears were very nearly in the middle of her cheeks  anxious to hear everything they might say curdie ventured to slide down a smooth part of the rock just under him to a projection below upon which he thought to rest  but whether he was not careful enough or the projection gave way down he came with a rush on the floor of the cavern bringing with him a great rumbling shower of stones  the goblins jumped from their seats in more anger than consternation for they had never yet seen anything to be afraid of in the palace but when they saw curdie with his pick in his hand their rage was mingled with fear for they took him for the first of an invasion of miners  the king notwithstanding drew himself up to his full height of four feet spread himself to his full breadth of three and a half for he was the handsomest and squarest of all the goblins and strutting up to curdie planted himself with outspread feet before him and said with dignity   'pray what right have you in my palace'  'the right of necessity your majesty' answered curdie  'i lost my way and did not know where i was wandering to'  'how did you get in'  'by a hole in the mountain'  'but you are a miner  look at your pickaxe'  curdie did look at it answering   'i came upon it lying on the ground a little way from here  i tumbled over some wild beasts who were playing with it  look your majesty' and curdie showed him how he was scratched and bitten  the king was pleased to find him behave more politely than he had expected from what his people had told him concerning the miners for he attributed it to the power of his own presence but he did not therefore feel friendly to the intruder  'you will oblige me by walking out of my dominions at once' he said well knowing what a mockery lay in the words  'with pleasure if your majesty will give me a guide' said curdie  'i will give you a thousand' said the king with a scoffing air of magnificent liberality  'one will be quite sufficient' said curdie  but the king uttered a strange shout half halloo half roar and in rushed goblins till the cave was swarming  he said something to the first of them which curdie could not hear and it was passed from one to another till in a moment the farthest in the crowd had evidently heard and understood it  they began to gather about him in a way he did not relish and he retreated towards the wall they pressed upon him  'stand back' said curdie grasping his pickaxe tighter by his knee  they only grinned and pressed closer  curdie bethought himself and began to rhyme     'ten twenty thirty    you're all so very dirty   twenty thirty forty    you're all so thick and snorty   'thirty forty fifty    you're all so puff-and-snifty   forty fifty sixty    beast and man so mixty    'fifty sixty seventy    mixty maxty leaventy   sixty seventy eighty    all your cheeks so slaty    'seventy eighty ninety   all your hands so flinty   eighty ninety hundred   altogether dundred'   the goblins fell back a little when he began and made horrible grimaces all through the rhyme as if eating something so disagreeable that it set their teeth on edge and gave them the creeps but whether it was that the rhyming words were most of them no words at all for a new rhyme being considered the more efficacious curdie had made it on the spur of the moment or whether it was that the presence of the king and queen gave them courage i cannot tell but the moment the rhyme was over they crowded on him again and out shot a hundred long arms with a multitude of thick nailless fingers at the ends of them to lay hold upon him  then curdie heaved up his axe  but being as gentle as courageous and not wishing to kill any of them he turned the end which was square and blunt like a hammer and with that came down a great blow on the head of the goblin nearest him  hard as the heads of all goblins are he thought he must feel that  and so he did no doubt but he only gave a horrible cry and sprung at curdie's throat curdie however drew back in time and just at that critical moment remembered the vulnerable part of the goblin body  he made a sudden rush at the king and stamped with all his might on his majesty's feet the king gave a most unkingly howl and almost fell into the fire curdie then rushed into the crowd stamping right and left  the goblins drew back howling on every side as he approached but they were so crowded that few of those he attacked could escape his tread and the shrieking and roaring that filled the cave would have appalled curdie but for the good hope it gave him  they were tumbling over each other in heaps in their eagerness to rush from the cave when a new assailant suddenly faced him the queen with flaming eyes and expanded nostrils her hair standing half up from her head rushed at him she trusted in her shoes  they were of granite hollowed like french sabots  curdie would have endured much rather than hurt a woman even if she was a goblin but here was an affair of life and death  forgetting her shoes he made a great stamp on one of her feet  but she instantly returned it with very different effect causing him frightful pain and almost disabling him  his only chance with her would have been to attack the granite shoes with his pickaxe but before he could think of that she had caught him up in her arms and was rushing with him across the cave  she dashed him into a hole in the wall with a force that almost stunned him  but although he could not move he was not too far gone to hear her great cry and the rush of multitudes of soft feet followed by the sounds of something heaved up against the rock after which came a multitudinous patter of stones falling near him  the last had not ceased when he grew very faint for his head had been badly cut and at last insensible  when he came to himself there was perfect silence about him and utter darkness but for the merest glimmer in one tiny spot  he crawled to it and found that they had heaved a slab against the mouth of the hole past the edge of which a poor little gleam found its way from the fire  he could not move it a hairbreadth for they had piled a great heap of stones against it  he crawled back to where he had been lying in the faint hope of finding his pickaxe but after a vain search he was at last compelled to acknowledge himself in an evil plight  he sat down and tried to think but soon fell fast asleep    chapter 19  goblin counsels  he must have slept a long time for when he awoke he felt wonderfully restored indeed almost well and very hungry  there were voices in the outer cave  once more then it was night for the goblins slept during the day and went about their affairs during the night  in the universal and constant darkness of their dwelling they had no reason to prefer the one arrangement to the other but from aversion to the sun-people they chose to be busy when there was least chance of their being met either by the miners below when they were burrowing or by the people of the mountain above when they were feeding their sheep or catching their goats  and indeed it was only when the sun was away that the outside of the mountain was sufficiently like their own dismal regions to be endurable to their mole eyes so thoroughly had they become unaccustomed to any light beyond that of their own fires and torches  curdie listened and soon found that they were talking of himself  'how long will it take' asked harelip  'not many days i should think' answered the king  'they are poor feeble creatures those sun-people and want to be always eating we can go a week at a time without food and be all the better for it but i've been told they eat two or three times every day  can you believe it  they must be quite hollow inside not at all like us nine-tenths of whose bulk is solid flesh and bone  yes i judge a week of starvation will do for him'  'if i may be allowed a word' interposed the queen 'and i think i ought to have some voice in the matter '  'the wretch is entirely at your disposal my spouse' interrupted the king  'he is your property  you caught him yourself  we should never have done it'  the queen laughed  she seemed in far better humour than the night before  'i was about to say' she resumed 'that it does seem a pity to waste so much fresh meat'  'what are you thinking of my love' said the king  'the very notion of starving him implies that we are not going to give him any meat either salt or fresh'  'i'm not such a stupid as that comes to' returned her majesty 'what i mean is that by the time he is starved there will hardly be a picking upon his bones'  the king gave a great laugh  'well my spouse you may have him when you like' he said  'i don't fancy him for my part  i am pretty sure he is tough eating'  'that would be to honour instead of punish his insolence' returned the queen  'but why should our poor creatures be deprived of so much nourishment  our little dogs and cats and pigs and small bears would enjoy him very much'  'you are the best of housekeepers my lovely queen' said her husband 'let it be so by all means  let us have our people in and get him out and kill him at once  he deserves it  the mischief he might have brought upon us now that he had penetrated so far as our most retired citadel is incalculable  or rather let us tie him hand and foot and have the pleasure of seeing him torn to pieces by full torchlight in the great hall'  'better and better' cried the queen and the prince together both of them clapping their hands  and the prince made an ugly noise with his hare-lip just as if he had intended to be one at the feast  'but' added the queen bethinking herself 'he is so troublesome for poor creatures as they are there is something about those sun-people that is very troublesome  i cannot imagine how it is that with such superior strength and skill and understanding as ours we permit them to exist at all  why do we not destroy them entirely and use their cattle and grazing lands at our pleasure of course we don't want to live in their horrid country  it is far too glaring for our quieter and more refined tastes  but we might use it as a sort of outhouse you know  even our creatures' eyes might get used to it and if they did grow blind that would be of no consequence provided they grew fat as well  but we might even keep their great cows and other creatures and then we should have a few more luxuries such as cream and cheese which at present we only taste occasionally when our brave men have succeeded in carrying some off from their farms'  'it is worth thinking of' said the king 'and i don't know why you should be the first to suggest it except that you have a positive genius for conquest  but still as you say there is something very troublesome about them and it would be better as i understand you to suggest that we should starve him for a day or two first so that he may be a little less frisky when we take him out'     'once there was a goblin   living in a hole   busy he was cobblin'   a shoe without a sole    'by came a birdie    goblin what do you do   cobble at a sturdie   upper leather shoe    'what's the good o' that sir   said the little bird   why it's very pat sir    plain without a word    'where 'tis all a hole sir   never can be holes    why should their shoes have soles sir   when they've got no souls'   'what's that horrible noise' cried the queen shuddering from pot-metal head to granite shoes  'i declare' said the king with solemn indignation 'it's the sun-creature in the hole'  'stop that disgusting noise' cried the crown prince valiantly getting up and standing in front of the heap of stones with his face towards curdie's prison  'do now or i'll break your head'  'break away' shouted curdie and began singing again      'once there was a goblin   living in a hole '   'i really cannot bear it' said the queen  'if i could only get at his horrid toes with my slippers again'  'i think we had better go to bed' said the king  'it's not time to go to bed' said the queen  'i would if i was you' said curdie  'impertinent wretch' said the queen with the utmost scorn in her voice  'an impossible if' said his majesty with dignity  'quite' returned curdie and began singing again      'go to bed   goblin do   help the queen   take off her shoe    'if you do   it will disclose   a horrid set   of sprouting toes'   'what a lie' roared the queen in a rage  'by the way that reminds me' said the king 'that for as long as we have been married i have never seen your feet queen  i think you might take off your shoes when you go to bed  they positively hurt me sometimes'  'i will do as i like' retorted the queen sulkily  'you ought to do as your own hubby wishes you' said the king  'i will not' said the queen  'then i insist upon it' said the king  apparently his majesty approached the queen for the purpose of following the advice given by curdie for the latter heard a scuffle and then a great roar from the king  'will you be quiet then' said the queen wickedly  'yes yes queen  i only meant to coax you'  'hands off' cried the queen triumphantly  'i'm going to bed  you may come when you like  but as long as i am queen i will sleep in my shoes  it is my royal privilege  harelip go to bed'  'i'm going' said harelip sleepily  'so am i' said the king  'come along then' said the queen 'and mind you are good or i'll '  'oh no no no' screamed the king in the most supplicating of tones  curdie heard only a muttered reply in the distance and then the cave was quite still  they had left the fire burning and the light came through brighter than before  curdie thought it was time to try again if anything could be done  but he found he could not get even a finger through the chink between the slab and the rock  he gave a great rush with his shoulder against the slab but it yielded no more than if it had been part of the rock  all he could do was to sit down and think again  by and by he came to the resolution to pretend to be dying in the hope they might take him out before his strength was too much exhausted to let him have a chance  then for the creatures if he could but find his axe again he would have no fear of them and if it were not for the queen's horrid shoes he would have no fear at all  meantime until they should come again at night there was nothing for him to do but forge new rhymes now his only weapons  he had no intention of using them at present of course but it was well to have a stock for he might live to want them and the manufacture of them would help to while away the time    chapter 20  irene's clue  that same morning early the princess woke in a terrible fright there was a hideous noise in her room creatures snarling and hissing and rocketing about as if they were fighting  the moment she came to herself she remembered something she had never thought of again what her grandmother told her to do when she was frightened  she immediately took off her ring and put it under her pillow  as she did so she fancied she felt a finger and thumb take it gently from under her palm  'it must be my grandmother' she said to herself and the thought gave her such courage that she stopped to put on her dainty little slippers before running from the room  while doing this she caught sight of a long cloak of sky-blue thrown over the back of a chair by the bedside  she had never seen it before but it was evidently waiting for her  she put it on and then feeling with the forefinger of her right hand soon found her grandmother's thread which she proceeded at once to follow expecting it would lead her straight up the old stair when she reached the door she found it went down and ran along the floor so that she had almost to crawl in order to keep a hold of it  then to her surprise and somewhat to her dismay she found that instead of leading her towards the stair it turned in quite the opposite direction  it led her through certain narrow passages towards the kitchen turning aside ere she reached it and guiding her to a door which communicated with a small back yard some of the maids were already up and this door was standing open across the yard the thread still ran along the ground until it brought her to a door in the wall which opened upon the mountainside  when she had passed through the thread rose to about half her height and she could hold it with ease as she walked  it led her straight up the mountain  the cause of her alarm was less frightful than she supposed  the cook's great black cat pursued by the housekeeper's terrier had bounced against her bedroom door which had not been properly fastened and the two had burst into the room together and commenced a battle royal  how the nurse came to sleep through it was a mystery but i suspect the old lady had something to do with it  it was a clear warm morning  the wind blew deliciously over the mountainside  here and there she saw a late primrose but she did not stop to call upon them  the sky was mottled with small clouds  the sun was not yet up but some of their fluffy edges had caught his light and hung out orange and gold-coloured fringes upon the air  the dew lay in round drops upon the leaves and hung like tiny diamond ear-rings from the blades of grass about her path  'how lovely that bit of gossamer is' thought the princess looking at a long undulating line that shone at some distance from her up the hill  it was not the time for gossamers though and irene soon discovered that it was her own thread she saw shining on before her in the light of the morning  it was leading her she knew not whither but she had never in her life been out before sunrise and everything was so fresh and cool and lively and full of something coming that she felt too happy to be afraid of anything  after leading her up a good distance the thread turned to the left and down the path upon which she and lootie had met curdie but she never thought of that for now in the morning light with its far outlook over the country no path could have been more open and airy and cheerful  she could see the road almost to the horizon along which she had so often watched her king-papa and his troop come shining with the bugle-blast cleaving the air before them and it was like a companion to her  down and down the path went then up and then down and then up again getting rugged and more rugged as it went and still along the path went the silvery thread and still along the thread went irene's little rosy-tipped forefinger  by and by she came to a little stream that jabbered and prattled down the hill and up the side of the stream went both path and thread  and still the path grew rougher and steeper and the mountain grew wilder till irene began to think she was going a very long way from home and when she turned to look back she saw that the level country had vanished and the rough bare mountain had closed in about her  but still on went the thread and on went the princess  everything around her was getting brighter and brighter as the sun came nearer till at length his first rays all at once alighted on the top of a rock before her like some golden creature fresh from the sky  then she saw that the little stream ran out of a hole in that rock that the path did not go past the rock and that the thread was leading her straight up to it  a shudder ran through her from head to foot when she found that the thread was actually taking her into the hole out of which the stream ran  it ran out babbling joyously but she had to go in  she did not hesitate  right into the hole she went which was high enough to let her walk without stooping  for a little way there was a brown glimmer but at the first turn it all but ceased and before she had gone many paces she was in total darkness  then she began to be frightened indeed  every moment she kept feeling the thread backwards and forwards and as she went farther and farther into the darkness of the great hollow mountain she kept thinking more and more about her grandmother and all that she had said to her and how kind she had been and how beautiful she was and all about her lovely room and the fire of roses and the great lamp that sent its light through stone walls  and she became more and more sure that the thread could not have gone there of itself and that her grandmother must have sent it but it tried her dreadfully when the path went down very steep and especially when she came to places where she had to go down rough stairs and even sometimes a ladder  through one narrow passage after another over lumps of rock and sand and clay the thread guided her until she came to a small hole through which she had to creep  finding no change on the other side 'shall i ever get back' she thought over and over again wondering at herself that she was not ten times more frightened and often feeling as if she were only walking in the story of a dream  sometimes she heard the noise of water a dull gurgling inside the rock  by and by she heard the sounds of blows which came nearer and nearer but again they grew duller and almost died away in a hundred directions she turned obedient to the guiding thread  at last she spied a dull red shine and came up to the mica window and thence away and round about and right into a cavern where glowed the red embers of a fire  here the thread began to rise it rose as high as her head and higher still  what should she do if she lost her hold she was pulling it down  she might break it she could see it far up glowing as red as her fire-opal in the light of the embers  but presently she came to a huge heap of stones piled in a slope against the wall of the cavern  on these she climbed and soon recovered the level of the thread only however to find the next moment that it vanished through the heap of stones and left her standing on it with her face to the solid rock  for one terrible moment she felt as if her grandmother had forsaken her  the thread which the spiders had spun far over the seas which her grandmother had sat in the moonlight and spun again for her which she had tempered in the rose-fire and tied to her opal ring had left her had gone where she could no longer follow it had brought her into a horrible cavern and there left her  she was forsaken indeed  'when shall i wake' she said to herself in an agony but the same moment knew that it was no dream  she threw herself upon the heap and began to cry  it was well she did not know what creatures one of them with stone shoes on her feet were lying in the next cave but neither did she know who was on the other side of the slab  at length the thought struck her that at least she could follow the thread backwards and thus get out of the mountain and home  she rose at once and found the thread  but the instant she tried to feel it backwards it vanished from her touch  forwards it led her hand up to the heap of stones backwards it seemed nowhere neither could she see it as before in the light of the fire  she burst into a wailing cry and again threw herself down on the stones    chapter 21  the escape  as the princess lay and sobbed she kept feeling the thread mechanically following it with her finger many times up to the stones in which it disappeared  by and by she began still mechanically to poke her finger in after it between the stones as far as she could all at once it came into her head that she might remove some of the stones and see where the thread went next almost laughing at herself for never having thought of this before she jumped to her feet  her fear vanished once more she was certain her grandmother's thread could not have brought her there just to leave her there and she began to throw away the stones from the top as fast as she could sometimes two or three at a handful sometimes taking both hands to lift one  after clearing them away a little she found that the thread turned and went straight downwards  hence as the heap sloped a good deal growing of course wider towards its base she had to throw away a multitude of stones to follow the thread  but this was not all for she soon found that the thread after going straight down for a little way turned first sideways in one direction then sideways in another and then shot at various angles hither and thither inside the heap so that she began to be afraid that to clear the thread she must remove the whole huge gathering  she was dismayed at the very idea but losing no time set to work with a will and with aching back and bleeding fingers and hands she worked on sustained by the pleasure of seeing the heap slowly diminish and begin to show itself on the opposite side of the fire  another thing which helped to keep up her courage was that as often as she uncovered a turn of the thread instead of lying loose upon the stone it tightened up this made her sure that her grandmother was at the end of it somewhere  she had got about half-way down when she started and nearly fell with fright  close to her ears as it seemed a voice broke out singing     'jabber bother smash   you'll have it all in a crash   jabber smash bother   you'll have the worst of the pother   smash bother jabber '   here curdie stopped either because he could not find a rhyme to 'jabber' or because he remembered what he had forgotten when he woke up at the sound of irene's labours that his plan was to make the goblins think he was getting weak  but he had uttered enough to let irene know who he was  'it's curdie' she cried joyfully  'hush hush' came curdie's voice again from somewhere  'speak softly'  'why you were singing loud' said irene  'yes  but they know i am here and they don't know you are  who are you'  'i'm irene' answered the princess  'i know who you are quite well you're curdie'  'why how ever did you come here irene'  'my great-great-grandmother sent me and i think i've found out why you can't get out i suppose'  'no i can't  what are you doing'  'clearing away a huge heap of stones'  'there's a princess' exclaimed curdie in a tone of delight but still speaking in little more than a whisper  'i can't think how you got here though'  'my grandmother sent me after her thread'  'i don't know what you mean' said curdie 'but so you're there it doesn't much matter'  'oh yes it does' returned irene  'i should never have been here but for her'  'you can tell me all about it when we get out then  there's no time to lose now'said curdie  and irene went to work as fresh as when she began  'there's such a lot of stones' she said  'it will take me a long time to get them all away'  'how far on have you got' asked curdie  'i've got about the half away but the other half is ever so much bigger'  'i don't think you will have to move the lower half  do you see a slab laid up against the wall'  irene looked and felt about with her hands and soon perceived the outlines of the slab  'yes' she answered 'i do'  'then i think' rejoined curdie 'when you have cleared the slab about half-way down or a bit more i shall be able to push it over'  'i must follow my thread' returned irene 'whatever i do'  'what do you mean' exclaimed curdie 'you will see when you get out' answered the princess and went on harder than ever  but she was soon satisfied that what curdie wanted done and what the thread wanted done were one and the same thing  for she not only saw that by following the turns of the thread she had been clearing the face of the slab but that a little more than half-way down the thread went through the chink between the slab and the wall into the place where curdie was confined so that she could not follow it any farther until the slab was out of her way as soon as she found this she said in a right joyous whisper   'now curdie i think if you were to give a great push the slab would tumble over'  'stand quite clear of it then' said curdie 'and let me know when you are ready'  irene got off the heap and stood on one side of it  'now curdie' she cried  curdie gave a great rush with his shoulder against it  out tumbled the slab on the heap and out crept curdie over the top of it  'you've saved my life irene' he whispered  'oh curdie i'm so glad  let's get out of this horrid place as fast as we can'  'that's easier said than done' returned he  'oh no it's quite easy' said irene  'we have only to follow my thread  i am sure that it's going to take us out now'  she had already begun to follow it over the fallen slab into the hole while curdie was searching the floor of the cavern for his pickaxe  'here it is' he cried  'no it is not' he added in a disappointed tone  'what can it be then  i declare it's a torch that is jolly it's better almost than my pickaxe  much better if it weren't for those stone shoes' he went on as he lighted the torch by blowing the last embers of the expiring fire  when he looked up with the lighted torch casting a glare into the great darkness of the huge cavern he caught sight of irene disappearing in the hole out of which he had himself just come  'where are you going there' he cried  'that's not the way out that's where i couldn't get out'  'i know that' whispered irene  'but this is the way my thread goes and i must follow it'  'what nonsense the child talks' said curdie to himself  'i must follow her though and see that she comes to no harm  she will soon find she can't get out that way and then she will come with me'  so he crept over the slab once more into the hole with his torch in his hand  but when he looked about in it he could see her nowhere  and now he discovered that although the hole was narrow it was much longer than he had supposed for in one direction the roof came down very low and the hole went off in a narrow passage of which he could not see the end  the princess must have crept in there  he got on his knees and one hand holding the torch with the other and crept after her the hole twisted about in some parts so low that he could hardly get through in others so high that he could not see the roof but everywhere it was narrow far too narrow for a goblin to get through and so i presume they never thought that curdie might  he was beginning to feel very uncomfortable lest something should have befallen the princess when he heard her voice almost close to his ear whispering   'aren't you coming curdie'  and when he turned the next corner there she stood waiting for him  'i knew you couldn't go wrong in that narrow hole but now you must keep by me for here is a great wide place' she said  'i can't understand it' said curdie half to himself half to irene  'never mind' she returned  'wait till we get out'  curdie utterly astonished that she had already got so far and by a path he had known nothing of thought it better to let her do as she pleased  'at all events' he said again to himself 'i know nothing about the way miner as i am and she seems to think she does know something about it though how she should passes my comprehension  so she's just as likely to find her way as i am and as she insists on taking the lead i must follow  we can't be much worse off than we are anyhow'  reasoning thus he followed her a few steps and came out in another great cavern across which irene walked in a straight line as confidently as if she knew every step of the way  curdie went on after her flashing his torch about and trying to see something of what lay around them suddenly he started back a pace as the light fell upon something close by which irene was passing  it was a platform of rock raised a few feet from the floor and covered with sheepskins upon which lay two horrible figures asleep at once recognized by curdie as the king and queen of the goblins  he lowered his torch instantly lest the light should awake them  as he did so it flashed upon his pickaxe lying by the side of the queen whose hand lay close by the handle of it  'stop one moment' he whispered  'hold my torch and don't let the light on their faces'  irene shuddered when she saw the frightful creatures whom she had passed without observing them but she did as he requested and turning her back held the torch low in front of her  curdie drew his pickaxe carefully away and as he did so spied one of her feet projecting from under the skins  the great clumsy granite shoe exposed thus to his hand was a temptation not to be resisted  he laid hold of it and with cautious efforts drew it off  the moment he succeeded he saw to his astonishment that what he had sung in ignorance to annoy the queen was actually true  she had six horrible toes  overjoyed at his success and seeing by the huge bump in the sheepskins where the other foot was he proceeded to lift them gently for if he could only succeed in carrying away the other shoe as well he would be no more afraid of the goblins than of so many flies  but as he pulled at the second shoe the queen gave a growl and sat up in bed  the same instant the king awoke also and sat up beside her  'run irene' cried curdie for though he was not now in the least afraid for himself he was for the princess  irene looked once round saw the fearful creatures awake and like the wise princess she was dashed the torch on the ground and extinguished it crying out   'here curdie take my hand'  he darted to her side forgetting neither the queen's shoe nor his pickaxe and caught hold of her hand as she sped fearlessly where her thread guided her  they heard the queen give a great bellow but they had a good start for it would be some time before they could get torches lighted to pursue them  just as they thought they saw a gleam behind them the thread brought them to a very narrow opening through which irene crept easily and curdie with difficulty  'now'said curdie 'i think we shall be safe'  'of course we shall' returned irene  'why do you think so'asked curdie  'because my grandmother is taking care of us'  'that's all nonsense' said curdie  'i don't know what you mean'  'then if you don't know what i mean what right have you to call it nonsense' asked the princess a little offended  'i beg your pardon irene' said curdie 'i did not mean to vex you'  'of course not' returned the princess  'but why do you think we shall be safe'  'because the king and queen are far too stout to get through that hole'  'there might be ways round' said the princess  'to be sure there might  we are not out of it yet' acknowledged curdie  'but what do you mean by the king and queen' asked the princess 'i should never call such creatures as those a king and a queen'  'their own people do though' answered curdie  the princess asked more questions and curdie as they walked leisurely along gave her a full account not only of the character and habits of the goblins so far as he knew them but of his own adventures with them beginning from the very night after that in which he had met her and lootie upon the mountain  when he had finished he begged irene to tell him how it was that she had come to his rescue  so irene too had to tell a long story which she did in rather a roundabout manner interrupted by many questions concerning things she had not explained but her tale as he did not believe more than half of it left everything as unaccountable to him as before and he was nearly as much perplexed as to what he must think of the princess  he could not believe that she was deliberately telling stories and the only conclusion he could come to was that lootie had been playing the child tricks inventing no end of lies to frighten her for her own purposes  'but how ever did lootie come to let you go into the mountains alone'he asked  'lootie knows nothing about it  i left her fast asleep at least i think so  i hope my grandmother won't let her get into trouble for it wasn't her fault at all as my grandmother very well knows'  'but how did you find your way to me' persisted curdie  'i told you already' answered irene 'by keeping my finger upon my grandmother's thread as i am doing now'  'you don't mean you've got the thread there'  'of course i do  i have told you so ten times already  i have hardly except when i was removing the stones taken my finger off it there' she added guiding curdie's hand to the thread 'you feel it yourself don't you'  'i feel nothing at all' replied curdie 'then what can be the matter with your finger  i feel it perfectly  to be sure it is very thin and in the sunlight looks just like the thread of a spider though there are many of them twisted together to make it but for all that i can't think why you shouldn't feel it as well as i do'  curdie was too polite to say he did not believe there was any thread there at all  what he did say was   'well i can make nothing of it'  'i can though and you must be glad of that for it will do for both of us'  'we're not out yet' said curdie  'we soon shall be' returned irene confidently  and now the thread went downwards and led irene's hand to a hole in the floor of the cavern whence came a sound of running water which they had been hearing for some time  'it goes into the ground now curdie' she said stopping  he had been listening to another sound which his practised ear had caught long ago and which also had been growing louder  it was the noise the goblin-miners made at their work and they seemed to be at no great distance now  irene heard it the moment she stopped  'what is that noise' she asked  'do you know curdie'  'yes  it is the goblins digging and burrowing' he answered  'and you don't know what they do it for'  'no i haven't the least idea  would you like to see them' he asked wishing to have another try after their secret  'if my thread took me there i shouldn't much mind but i don't want to see them and i can't leave my thread  it leads me down into the hole and we had better go at once'  'very well  shall i go in first' said curdie  'no better not  you can't feel the thread' she answered stepping down through a narrow break in the floor of the cavern 'oh' she cried 'i am in the water  it is running strong but it is not deep and there is just room to walk  make haste curdie'  he tried but the hole was too small for him to get in  'go on a little bit he said shouldering his pickaxe  in a few moments he had cleared a larger opening and followed her  they went on down and down with the running water curdie getting more and more afraid it was leading them to some terrible gulf in the heart of the mountain in one or two places he had to break away the rock to make room before even irene could get through at least without hurting herself  but at length they spied a glimmer of light and in a minute more they were almost blinded by the full sunlight into which they emerged  it was some little time before the princess could see well enough to discover that they stood in her own garden close by the seat on which she and her king-papa had sat that afternoon  they had come out by the channel of the little stream  she danced and clapped her hands with delight  'now curdie' she cried 'won't you believe what i told you about my grandmother and her thread'  for she had felt all the time that curdie was not believing what she told him  'there don't you see it shining on before us' she added  'i don't see anything' persisted curdie  'then you must believe without seeing' said the princess 'for you can't deny it has brought us out of the mountain'  'i can't deny we are out of the mountain and i should be very ungrateful indeed to deny that you had brought me out of it'  'i couldn't have done it but for the thread' persisted irene  'that's the part i don't understand'  'well come along and lootie will get you something to eat  i am sure you must want it very much'  'indeed i do  but my father and mother will be so anxious about me i must make haste first up the mountain to tell my mother and then down into the mine again to let my father know'  'very well curdie but you can't get out without coming this way and i will take you through the house for that is nearest'  they met no one by the way for indeed as before the people were here and there and everywhere searching for the princess  when they got in irene found that the thread as she had half expected went up the old staircase and a new thought struck her  she turned to curdie and said   'my grandmother wants me  do come up with me and see her  then you will know that i have been telling you the truth  do come to please me curdie  i can't bear you should think what i say is not true'  'i never doubted you believed what you said' returned curdie  'i only thought you had some fancy in your head that was not correct' 'but do come dear curdie'  the little miner could not withstand this appeal and though he felt shy in what seemed to him a huge grand house he yielded and followed her up the stair    chapter 22  the old lady and curdie  up the stair then they went and the next and the next and through the long rows of empty rooms and up the little tower stair irene growing happier and happier as she ascended  there was no answer when she knocked at length at the door of the workroom nor could she hear any sound of the spinning-wheel and once more her heart sank within her but only for one moment as she turned and knocked at the other door  'come in' answered the sweet voice of her grandmother and irene opened the door and entered followed by curdie  'you darling' cried the lady who was seated by a fire of red roses mingled with white  'i've been waiting for you and indeed getting a little anxious about you and beginning to think whether i had not better go and fetch you myself'  as she spoke she took the little princess in her arms and placed her upon her lap  she was dressed in white now and looking if possible more lovely than ever  'i've brought curdie grandmother  he wouldn't believe what i told him and so i've brought him'  'yes i see him  he is a good boy curdie and a brave boy aren't you glad you've got him out'  'yes grandmother  but it wasn't very good of him not to believe me when i was telling him the truth'  'people must believe what they can and those who believe more must not be hard upon those who believe less  i doubt if you would have believed it all yourself if you hadn't seen some of it'  'ah yes grandmother i dare say  i'm sure you are right  but he'll believe now'  'i don't know that' replied her grandmother  'won't you curdie' said irene looking round at him as she asked the question  he was standing in the middle of the floor staring and looking strangely bewildered  this she thought came of his astonishment at the beauty of the lady  'make a bow to my grandmother curdie' she said  'i don't see any grandmother' answered curdie rather gruffly  'don't see my grandmother when i'm sitting in her lap' exclaimed the princess  'no i don't' reiterated curdie in an offended tone  'don't you see the lovely fire of roses white ones amongst them this time' asked irene almost as bewildered as he  'no i don't' answered curdie almost sulkily  'nor the blue bed  nor the rose-coloured counterpane nor the beautiful light like the moon hanging from the roof'  'you're making game of me your royal highness and after what we have come through together this day i don't think it is kind of you' said curdie feeling very much hurt  'then what do you see' asked irene who perceived at once that for her not to believe him was at least as bad as for him not to believe her  'i see a big bare garret-room like the one in mother's cottage only big enough to take the cottage itself in and leave a good margin all round' answered curdie  'and what more do you see'  'i see a tub and a heap of musty straw and a withered apple and a ray of sunlight coming through a hole in the middle of the roof and shining on your head and making all the place look a curious dusky brown  i think you had better drop it princess and go down to the nursery like a good girl'  'but don't you hear my grandmother talking to me' asked irene almost crying  'no  i hear the cooing of a lot of pigeons  if you won't come down i will go without you  i think that will be better anyhow for i'm sure nobody who met us would believe a word we said to them  they would think we made it all up  i don't expect anybody but my own father and mother to believe me  they know i wouldn't tell a story'  'and yet you won't believe me curdie' expostulated the princess now fairly crying with vexation and sorrow at the gulf between her and curdie  'no  i can't and i can't help it' said curdie turning to leave the room  'what shall i do grandmother' sobbed the princess turning her face round upon the lady's bosom and shaking with suppressed sobs  'you must give him time' said her grandmother 'and you must be content not to be believed for a while  it is very hard to bear but i have had to bear it and shall have to bear it many a time yet  i will take care of what curdie thinks of you in the end you must let him go now'  'you're not coming are you' asked curdie  'no curdie my grandmother says i must let you go  turn to the right when you get to the bottom of all the stairs and that will take you to the hall where the great door is'  'oh i don't doubt i can find my way without you princess or your old grannie's thread either' said curdie quite rudely  'oh curdie  curdie'  'i wish i had gone home at once  i'm very much obliged to you irene for getting me out of that hole but i wish you hadn't made a fool of me afterwards'  he said this as he opened the door which he left open and without another word went down the stair  irene listened with dismay to his departing footsteps  then turning again to the lady   'what does it all mean grandmother' she sobbed and burst into fresh tears  'it means my love that i did not mean to show myself  curdie is not yet able to believe some things  seeing is not believing it is only seeing  you remember i told you that if lootie were to see me she would rub her eyes forget the half she saw and call the other half nonsense'  'yes but i should have thought curdie '  'you are right  curdie is much farther on than lootie and you will see what will come of it  but in the meantime you must be content i say to be misunderstood for a while  we are all very anxious to be understood and it is very hard not to be  but there is one thing much more necessary'  'what is that grandmother'  'to understand other people'  'yes grandmother  i must be fair for if i'm not fair to other people i'm not worth being understood myself  i see  so as curdie can't help it i will not be vexed with him but just wait'  'there's my own dear child' said her grandmother and pressed her close to her bosom  'why weren't you in your workroom when we came up grandmother' asked irene after a few moments' silence  'if i had been there curdie would have seen me well enough  but why should i be there rather than in this beautiful room'  'i thought you would be spinning'  'i've nobody to spin for just at present  i never spin without knowing for whom i am spinning'  'that reminds me there is one thing that puzzles me' said the princess  'how are you to get the thread out of the mountain again surely you won't have to make another for me  that would be such a trouble'  the lady set her down and rose and went to the fire  putting in her hand she drew it out again and held up the shining ball between her finger and thumb  'i've got it now you see' she said coming back to the princess 'all ready for you when you want it'  going to her cabinet she laid it in the same drawer as before  'and here is your ring' she added taking it from the little finger of her left hand and putting it on the forefinger of irene's right hand  'oh thank you grandmother i feel so safe now'  'you are very tired my child' the lady went on  'your hands are hurt with the stones and i have counted nine bruises on you  just look what you are like'  and she held up to her a little mirror which she had brought from the cabinet  the princess burst into a merry laugh at the sight she was so draggled with the stream and dirty with creeping through narrow places that if she had seen the reflection without knowing it was a reflection she would have taken herself for some gipsy child whose face was washed and hair combed about once in a month the lady laughed too and lifting her again upon her knee took off her cloak and night-gown  then she carried her to the side of the room  irene wondered what she was going to do with her but asked no questions only starting a little when she found that she was going to lay her in the large silver bath for as she looked into it again she saw no bottom but the stars shining miles away as it seemed in a great blue gulf  her hands closed involuntarily on the beautiful arms that held her and that was all  the lady pressed her once more to her bosom saying   'do not be afraid my child'  'no grandmother' answered the princess with a little gasp and the next instant she sank in the clear cool water  when she opened her eyes she saw nothing but a strange lovely blue over and beneath and all about her  the lady and the beautiful room had vanished from her sight and she seemed utterly alone but instead of being afraid she felt more than happy perfectly blissful  and from somewhere came the voice of the lady singing a strange sweet song of which she could distinguish every word but of the sense she had only a feeling no understanding  nor could she remember a single line after it was gone  it vanished like the poetry in a dream as fast as it came  in after years however she would sometimes fancy that snatches of melody suddenly rising in her brain must be little phrases and fragments of the air of that song and the very fancy would make her happier and abler to do her duty  how long she lay in the water she did not know  it seemed a long time not from weariness but from pleasure  but at last she felt the beautiful hands lay hold of her and through the gurgling water she was lifted out into the lovely room  the lady carried her to the fire and sat down with her in her lap and dried her tenderly with the softest towel  it was so different from lootie's drying when the lady had done she stooped to the fire and drew from it her night-gown as white as snow  'how delicious' exclaimed the princess  'it smells of all the roses in the world i think'  when she stood up on the floor she felt as if she had been made over again  every bruise and all weariness were gone and her hands were soft and whole as ever  'now i am going to put you to bed for a good sleep' said her grandmother  'but what will lootie be thinking  and what am i to say to her when she asks me where i have been'  'don't trouble yourself about it  you will find it all come right' said her grandmother and laid her into the blue bed under the rosy counterpane  'there is just one thing more' said irene  'i am a little anxious about curdie  as i brought him into the house i ought to have seen him safe on his way home'  'i took care of all that' answered the lady  'i told you to let him go and therefore i was bound to look after him  nobody saw him and he is now eating a good dinner in his mother's cottage far up in the mountain'  'then i will go to sleep' said irene and in a few minutes she was fast asleep    chapter 23  curdie and his mother  curdie went up the mountain neither whistling nor singing for he was vexed with irene for taking him in as he called it and he was vexed with himself for having spoken to her so angrily  his mother gave a cry of joy when she saw him and at once set about getting him something to eat asking him questions all the time which he did not answer so cheerfully as usual  when his meal was ready she left him to eat it and hurried to the mine to let his father know he was safe when she came back she found him fast asleep upon her bed nor did he wake until his father came home in the evening  'now curdie' his mother said as they sat at supper 'tell us the whole story from beginning to end just as it all happened'  curdie obeyed and told everything to the point where they came out upon the lawn in the garden of the king's house  'and what happened after that' asked his mother  'you haven't told us all  you ought to be very happy at having got away from those demons and instead of that i never saw you so gloomy  there must be something more  besides you do not speak of that lovely child as i should like to hear you  she saved your life at the risk of her own and yet somehow you don't seem to think much of it'  'she talked such nonsense' answered curdie 'and told me a pack of things that weren't a bit true and i can't get over it'  'what were they' asked his father  'your mother may be able to throw some light upon them'  then curdie made a clean breast of it and told them everything  they all sat silent for some time pondering the strange tale  at last curdie's mother spoke  'you confess my boy' she said 'there is something about the whole affair you do not understand'  'yes of course mother' he answered  'i cannot understand how a child knowing nothing about the mountain or even that i was shut up in it should come all that way alone straight to where i was and then after getting me out of the hole lead me out of the mountain too where i should not have known a step of the way if it had been as light as in the open air'  'then you have no right to say what she told you was not true  she did take you out and she must have had something to guide her  why not a thread as well as a rope or anything else  there is something you cannot explain and her explanation may be the right one'  'it's no explanation at all mother and i can't believe it'  'that may be only because you do not understand it  if you did you would probably find it was an explanation and believe it thoroughly i don't blame you for not being able to believe it but i do blame you for fancying such a child would try to deceive you  why should she depend upon it she told you all she knew until you had found a better way of accounting for it all you might at least have been more sparing of your judgement'  'that is what something inside me has been saying all the time' said curdie hanging down his head  'but what do you make of the grandmother  that is what i can't get over  to take me up to an old garret and try to persuade me against the sight of my own eyes that it was a beautiful room with blue walls and silver stars and no end of things in it when there was nothing there but an old tub and a withered apple and a heap of straw and a sunbeam  it was too bad  she might have had some old woman there at least to pass for her precious grandmother'  'didn't she speak as if she saw those other things herself curdie'  'yes  that's what bothers me  you would have thought she really meant and believed that she saw every one of the things she talked about and not one of them there  it was too bad i say'  'perhaps some people can see things other people can't see curdie' said his mother very gravely  'i think i will tell you something i saw myself once only perhaps you won't believe me either'  'oh mother mother' cried curdie bursting into tears 'i don't deserve that surely'  'but what i am going to tell you is very strange' persisted his mother 'and if having heard it you were to say i must have been dreaming i don't know that i should have any right to be vexed with you though i know at least that i was not asleep'  'do tell me mother  perhaps it will help me to think better of the princess'  'that's why i am tempted to tell you' replied his mother  'but first i may as well mention that according to old whispers there is something more than common about the king's family and the queen was of the same blood for they were cousins of some degree there were strange stories told concerning them all good stories but strange very strange  what they were i cannot tell for i only remember the faces of my grandmother and my mother as they talked together about them  there was wonder and awe not fear in their eyes and they whispered and never spoke aloud  but what i saw myself was this  your father was going to work in the mine one night and i had been down with his supper  it was soon after we were married and not very long before you were born  he came with me to the mouth of the mine and left me to go home alone for i knew the way almost as well as the floor of our own cottage  it was pretty dark and in some parts of the road where the rocks overhung nearly quite dark  but i got along perfectly well never thinking of being afraid until i reached a spot you know well enough curdie where the path has to make a sharp turn out of the way of a great rock on the left-hand side  when i got there i was suddenly surrounded by about half a dozen of the cobs the first i had ever seen although i had heard tell of them often enough one of them blocked up the path and they all began tormenting and teasing me in a way it makes me shudder to think of even now'  'if i had only been with you' cried father and son in a breath  the mother gave a funny little smile and went on  'they had some of their horrible creatures with them too and i must confess i was dreadfully frightened  they had torn my clothes very much and i was afraid they were going to tear myself to pieces when suddenly a great white soft light shone upon me  i looked up  a broad ray like a shining road came down from a large globe of silvery light not very high up indeed not quite so high as the horizon so it could not have been a new star or another moon or anything of that sort  the cobs dropped persecuting me and looked dazed and i thought they were going to run away but presently they began again  the same moment however down the path from the globe of light came a bird shining like silver in the sun  it gave a few rapid flaps first and then with its wings straight out shot sliding down the slope of the light  it looked to me just like a white pigeon  but whatever it was when the cobs caught sight of it coming straight down upon them they took to their heels and scampered away across the mountain leaving me safe only much frightened  as soon as it had sent them off the bird went gliding again up the light and the moment it reached the globe the light disappeared just as if a shutter had been closed over a window and i saw it no more  but i had no more trouble with the cobs that night or ever after'  'how strange' exclaimed curdie  'yes it was strange but i can't help believing it whether you do or not' said his mother  'it's exactly as your mother told it to me the very next morning' said his father  'you don't think i'm doubting my own mother' cried curdie 'there are other people in the world quite as well worth believing as your own mother' said his mother  'i don't know that she's so much the fitter to be believed that she happens to be your mother mr curdie  there are mothers far more likely to tell lies than the little girl i saw talking to the primroses a few weeks ago  if she were to lie i should begin to doubt my own word'  'but princesses have told lies as well as other people' said curdie  'yes but not princesses like that child  she's a good girl i am certain and that's more than being a princess  depend upon it you will have to be sorry for behaving so to her curdie  you ought at least to have held your tongue'  'i am sorry now' answered curdie  'you ought to go and tell her so then'  'i don't see how i could manage that  they wouldn't let a miner boy like me have a word with her alone and i couldn't tell her before that nurse of hers  she'd be asking ever so many questions and i don't know how many the little princess would like me to answer  she told me that lootie didn't know anything about her coming to get me out of the mountain  i am certain she would have prevented her somehow if she had known it  but i may have a chance before long and meantime i must try to do something for her  i think father i have got on the track at last'  'have you indeed my boy' said peter  'i am sure you deserve some success you have worked very hard for it  what have you found out'  'it's difficult you know father inside the mountain especially in the dark and not knowing what turns you have taken to tell the lie of things outside'  'impossible my boy without a chart or at least a compass' returned his father  'well i think i have nearly discovered in what direction the cobs are mining  if i am right i know something else that i can put to it and then one and one will make three'  'they very often do curdie as we miners ought to be very well aware now tell us my boy what the two things are and see whether we can guess at the same third as you'  'i don't see what that has to do with the princess' interposed his mother  'i will soon let you see that mother  perhaps you may think me foolish but until i am sure there is nothing in my present fancy i am more determined than ever to go on with my observations  just as we came to the channel by which we got out i heard the miners at work somewhere near i think down below us  now since i began to watch them they have mined a good half-mile in a straight line and so far as i am aware they are working in no other part of the mountain  but i never could tell in what direction they were going  when we came out in the king's garden however i thought at once whether it was possible they were working towards the king's house and what i want to do tonight is to make sure whether they are or not  i will take a light with me '  'oh curdie' cried his mother 'then they will see you'  'i'm no more afraid of them now than i was before' rejoined curdie 'now that i've got this precious shoe  they can't make another such in a hurry and one bare foot will do for my purpose woman as she may be i won't spare her next time  but i shall be careful with my light for i don't want them to see me  i won't stick it in my hat'  'go on then and tell us what you mean to do'  'i mean to take a bit of paper with me and a pencil and go in at the mouth of the stream by which we came out  i shall mark on the paper as near as i can the angle of every turning i take until i find the cobs at work and so get a good idea in what direction they are going  if it should prove to be nearly parallel with the stream i shall know it is towards the king's house they are working'  'and what if you should  how much wiser will you be then'  'wait a minute mother dear  i told you that when i came upon the royal family in the cave they were talking of their prince harelip they called him marrying a sun-woman that means one of us one with toes to her feet  now in the speech one of them made that night at their great gathering of which i heard only a part he said that peace would be secured for a generation at least by the pledge the prince would hold for the good behaviour of her relatives  that's what he said and he must have meant the sun-woman the prince was to marry  i am quite sure the king is much too proud to wish his son to marry any but a princess and much too knowing to fancy that his having a peasant woman for a wife would be of any great advantage to them'  'i see what you are driving at now' said his mother  'but' said his father 'our king would dig the mountain to the plain before he would have his princess the wife of a cob if he were ten times a prince'  'yes but they think so much of themselves' said his mother 'small creatures always do  the bantam is the proudest cock in my little yard'  'and i fancy' said curdie 'if they once got her they would tell the king they would kill her except he consented to the marriage'  'they might say so' said his father 'but they wouldn't kill her they would keep her alive for the sake of the hold it gave them over our king  whatever he did to them they would threaten to do the same to the princess'  'and they are bad enough to torment her just for their own amusement i know that' said his mother  'anyhow i will keep a watch on them and see what they are up to' said curdie  'it's too horrible to think of  i daren't let myself do it  but they shan't have her at least if i can help it  so mother dear my clue is all right will you get me a bit of paper and a pencil and a lump of pease pudding and i will set out at once  i saw a place where i can climb over the wall of the garden quite easily'  'you must mind and keep out of the way of the men on the watch' said his mother  'that i will  i don't want them to know anything about it  they would spoil it all  the cobs would only try some other plan they are such obstinate creatures  i shall take good care mother they won't kill and eat me either if they should come upon me  so you needn't mind them'  his mother got him what he had asked for and curdie set out close beside the door by which the princess left the garden for the mountain stood a great rock and by climbing it curdie got over the wall  he tied his clue to a stone just inside the channel of the stream and took his pickaxe with him  he had not gone far before he encountered a horrid creature coming towards the mouth  the spot was too narrow for two of almost any size or shape and besides curdie had no wish to let the creature pass  not being able to use his pickaxe however he had a severe struggle with him and it was only after receiving many bites some of them bad that he succeeded in killing him with his pocket-knife  having dragged him out he made haste to get in again before another should stop up the way  i need not follow him farther in this night's adventures  he returned to his breakfast satisfied that the goblins were mining in the direction of the palace on so low a level that their intention must he thought be to burrow under the walls of the king's house and rise up inside it in order he fully believed to lay hands on the little princess and carry her off for a wife to their horrid harelip    chapter 24  irene behaves like a princess  when the princess awoke from the sweetest of sleeps she found her nurse bending over her the housekeeper looking over the nurse's shoulder and the laundry-maid looking over the housekeeper's the room was full of women-servants and the gentlemen-at-arms with a long column of servants behind them were peeping or trying to peep in at the door of the nursery  'are those horrid creatures gone' asked the princess remembering first what had terrified her in the morning  'you naughty naughty little princess' cried lootie  her face was very pale with red streaks in it and she looked as if she were going to shake her but irene said nothing only waited to hear what should come next  'how could you get under the clothes like that and make us all fancy you were lost  and keep it up all day too  you are the most obstinate child  it's anything but fun to us i can tell you'  it was the only way the nurse could account for her disappearance  'i didn't do that lootie' said irene very quietly  'don't tell stories' cried her nurse quite rudely  'i shall tell you nothing at all' said irene  'that's just as bad' said the nurse  'just as bad to say nothing at all as to tell stories' exclaimed the princess  'i will ask my papa about that  he won't say so and i don't think he will like you to say so'  'tell me directly what you mean by it' screamed the nurse half wild with anger at the princess and fright at the possible consequences to herself  'when i tell you the truth lootie' said the princess who somehow did not feel at all angry 'you say to me don't tell stories  it seems i must tell stories before you will believe me'  'you are very rude princess' said the nurse  'you are so rude lootie that i will not speak to you again till you are sorry  why should i when i know you will not believe me' returned the princess  for she did know perfectly well that if she were to tell lootie what she had been about the more she went on to tell her the less would she believe her  'you are the most provoking child' cried her nurse  'you deserve to be well punished for your wicked behaviour'  'please mrs housekeeper' said the princess 'will you take me to your room and keep me till my king-papa comes  i will ask him to come as soon as he can'  every one stared at these words  up to this moment they had all regarded her as little more than a baby  but the housekeeper was afraid of the nurse and sought to patch matters up saying   'i am sure princess nursie did not mean to be rude to you'  'i do not think my papa would wish me to have a nurse who spoke to me as lootie does  if she thinks i tell lies she had better either say so to my papa or go away  sir walter will you take charge of me'  'with the greatest of pleasure princess' answered the captain of the gentlemen-at-arms walking with his great stride into the room  the crowd of servants made eager way for him and he bowed low before the little princess's bed  'i shall send my servant at once on the fastest horse in the stable to tell your king-papa that your royal highness desires his presence  when you have chosen one of these under-servants to wait upon you i shall order the room to be cleared'  'thank you very much sir walter' said the princess and her eye glanced towards a rosy-cheeked girl who had lately come to the house as a scullery-maid  but when lootie saw the eyes of her dear princess going in search of another instead of her she fell upon her knees by the bedside and burst into a great cry of distress  'i think sir walter' said the princess 'i will keep lootie  but i put myself under your care and you need not trouble my king-papa until i speak to you again  will you all please to go away  i am quite safe and well and i did not hide myself for the sake either of amusing myself or of troubling my people  lootie will you please to dress me'    chapter 25  curdie comes to grief  everything was for some time quiet above ground  the king was still away in a distant part of his dominions  the men-at-arms kept watching about the house  they had been considerably astonished by finding at the foot of the rock in the garden the hideous body of the goblin creature killed by curdie but they came to the conclusion that it had been slain in the mines and had crept out there to die and except an occasional glimpse of a live one they saw nothing to cause alarm curdie kept watching in the mountain and the goblins kept burrowing deeper into the earth  as long as they went deeper there was curdie judged no immediate danger  to irene the summer was as full of pleasure as ever and for a long time although she often thought of her grandmother during the day and often dreamed about her at night she did not see her  the kids and the flowers were as much her delight as ever and she made as much friendship with the miners' children she met on the mountain as lootie would permit but lootie had very foolish notions concerning the dignity of a princess not understanding that the truest princess is just the one who loves all her brothers and sisters best and who is most able to do them good by being humble towards them  at the same time she was considerably altered for the better in her behaviour to the princess  she could not help seeing that she was no longer a mere child but wiser than her age would account for  she kept foolishly whispering to the servants however sometimes that the princess was not right in her mind sometimes that she was too good to live and other nonsense of the same sort  all this time curdie had to be sorry without a chance of confessing that he had behaved so unkindly to the princess  this perhaps made him the more diligent in his endeavours to serve her his mother and he often talked on the subject and she comforted him and told him she was sure he would some day have the opportunity he so much desired  here i should like to remark for the sake of princes and princesses in general that it is a low and contemptible thing to refuse to confess a fault or even an error  if a true princess has done wrong she is always uneasy until she has had an opportunity of throwing the wrongness away from her by saying  'i did it and i wish i had not and i am sorry for having done it' so you see there is some ground for supposing that curdie was not a miner only but a prince as well  many such instances have been known in the world's history  at length however he began to see signs of a change in the proceedings of the goblin excavators  they were going no deeper but had commenced running on a level and he watched them therefore more closely than ever  all at once one night coming to a slope of very hard rock they began to ascend along the inclined plane of its surface  having reached its top they went again on a level for a night or two after which they began to ascend once more and kept on at a pretty steep angle  at length curdie judged it time to transfer his observation to another quarter and the next night he did not go to the mine at all but leaving his pickaxe and clue at home and taking only his usual lumps of bread and pease pudding went down the mountain to the king's house  he climbed over the wall and remained in the garden the whole night creeping on hands and knees from one spot to the other and lying at full length with his ear to the ground listening  but he heard nothing except the tread of the men-at-arms as they marched about whose observation as the night was cloudy and there was no moon he had little difficulty in avoiding  for several following nights he continued to haunt the garden and listen but with no success  at length early one evening whether it was that he had got careless of his own safety or that the growing moon had become strong enough to expose him his watching came to a sudden end  he was creeping from behind the rock where the stream ran out for he had been listening all round it in the hope it might convey to his ear some indication of the whereabouts of the goblin miners when just as he came into the moonlight on the lawn a whizz in his ear and a blow upon his leg startled him  he instantly squatted in the hope of eluding further notice  but when he heard the sound of running feet he jumped up to take the chance of escape by flight he fell however with a keen shoot of pain for the bolt of a crossbow had wounded his leg and the blood was now streaming from it  he was instantly laid hold of by two or three of the men-at-arms  it was useless to struggle and he submitted in silence  'it's a boy' cried several of them together in a tone of amazement 'i thought it was one of those demons  what are you about here'  'going to have a little rough usage apparently' said curdie laughing as the men shook him  'impertinence will do you no good  you have no business here in the king's grounds and if you don't give a true account of yourself you shall fare as a thief'  'why what else could he be' said one  'he might have been after a lost kid you know' suggested another  'i see no good in trying to excuse him  he has no business here anyhow'  'let me go away then if you please' said curdie  'but we don't please not except you give a good account of yourself'  'i don't feel quite sure whether i can trust you' said curdie  'we are the king's own men-at-arms' said the captain courteously for he was taken with curdie's appearance and courage  'well i will tell you all about it if you will promise to listen to me and not do anything rash'  'i call that cool' said one of the party laughing  'he will tell us what mischief he was about if we promise to do as pleases him'  'i was about no mischief' said curdie  but ere he could say more he turned faint and fell senseless on the grass  then first they discovered that the bolt they had shot taking him for one of the goblin creatures had wounded him  they carried him into the house and laid him down in the hall  the report spread that they had caught a robber and the servants crowded in to see the villain  amongst the rest came the nurse the moment she saw him she exclaimed with indignation   'i declare it's the same young rascal of a miner that was rude to me and the princess on the mountain  he actually wanted to kiss the princess  i took good care of that the wretch  and he was prowling about was he  just like his impudence' the princess being fast asleep she could misrepresent at her pleasure  when he heard this the captain although he had considerable doubt of its truth resolved to keep curdie a prisoner until they could search into the affair  so after they had brought him round a little and attended to his wound which was rather a bad one they laid him still exhausted from the loss of blood upon a mattress in a disused room one of those already so often mentioned and locked the door and left him  he passed a troubled night and in the morning they found him talking wildly  in the evening he came to himself but felt very weak and his leg was exceedingly painful  wondering where he was and seeing one of the men-at-arms in the room he began to question him and soon recalled the events of the preceding night  as he was himself unable to watch any more he told the soldier all he knew about the goblins and begged him to tell his companions and stir them up to watch with tenfold vigilance but whether it was that he did not talk quite coherently or that the whole thing appeared incredible certainly the man concluded that curdie was only raving still and tried to coax him into holding his tongue  this of course annoyed curdie dreadfully who now felt in his turn what it was not to be believed and the consequence was that his fever returned and by the time when at his persistent entreaties the captain was called there could be no doubt that he was raving  they did for him what they could and promised everything he wanted but with no intention of fulfilment  at last he went to sleep and when at length his sleep grew profound and peaceful they left him locked the door again and withdrew intending to revisit him early in the morning    chapter 26  the goblin-miners  that same night several of the servants were having a chat together before going to bed  'what can that noise be' said one of the housemaids who had been listening for a moment or two  'i've heard it the last two nights' said the cook  'if there were any about the place i should have taken it for rats but my tom keeps them far enough'  'i've heard though' said the scullery-maid 'that rats move about in great companies sometimes  there may be an army of them invading us i've heard the noises yesterday and today too'  'it'll be grand fun then for my tom and mrs housekeeper's bob' said the cook  'they'll be friends for once in their lives and fight on the same side  i'll engage tom and bob together will put to flight any number of rats'  'it seems to me' said the nurse 'that the noises are much too loud for that  i have heard them all day and my princess has asked me several times what they could be  sometimes they sound like distant thunder and sometimes like the noises you hear in the mountain from those horrid miners underneath'  'i shouldn't wonder' said the cook 'if it was the miners after all they may have come on some hole in the mountain through which the noises reach to us  they are always boring and blasting and breaking you know'  as he spoke there came a great rolling rumble beneath them and the house quivered  they all started up in affright and rushing to the hall found the gentlemen-at-arms in consternation also they had sent to wake their captain who said from their description that it must have been an earthquake an occurrence which although very rare in that country had taken place almost within the century and then went to bed again strange to say and fell fast asleep without once thinking of curdie or associating the noises they had heard with what he had told them  he had not believed curdie  if he had he would at once have thought of what he had said and would have taken precautions  as they heard nothing more they concluded that sir walter was right and that the danger was over for perhaps another hundred years  the fact as discovered afterwards was that the goblins had in working up a second sloping face of stone arrived at a huge block which lay under the cellars of the house within the line of the foundations  it was so round that when they succeeded after hard work in dislodging it without blasting it rolled thundering down the slope with a bounding jarring roll which shook the foundations of the house  the goblins were themselves dismayed at the noise for they knew by careful spying and measuring that they must now be very near if not under the king's house and they feared giving an alarm  they therefore remained quiet for a while and when they began to work again they no doubt thought themselves very fortunate in coming upon a vein of sand which filled a winding fissure in the rock on which the house was built  by scooping this away they came out in the king's wine cellar  no sooner did they find where they were than they scurried back again like rats into their holes and running at full speed to the goblin palace announced their success to the king and queen with shouts of triumph  in a moment the goblin royal family and the whole goblin people were on their way in hot haste to the king's house each eager to have a share in the glory of carrying off that same night the princess irene  the queen went stumping along in one shoe of stone and one of skin  this could not have been pleasant and my readers may wonder that with such skilful workmen about her she had not yet replaced the shoe carried off by curdie  as the king however had more than one ground of objection to her stone shoes he no doubt took advantage of the discovery of her toes and threatened to expose her deformity if she had another made  i presume he insisted on her being content with skin shoes and allowed her to wear the remaining granite one on the present occasion only because she was going out to war  they soon arrived in the king's wine cellar and regardless of its huge vessels of which they did not know the use proceeded at once but as quietly as they could to force the door that led upwards    chapter 27  the goblins in the king's house  when curdie fell asleep he began at once to dream  he thought he was ascending the mountainside from the mouth of the mine whistling and singing 'ring dod bang' when he came upon a woman and child who had lost their way and from that point he went on dreaming everything that had happened to him since he thus met the princess and lootie how he had watched the goblins how he had been taken by them how he had been rescued by the princess everything indeed until he was wounded captured and imprisoned by the men-at-arms  and now he thought he was lying wide awake where they had laid him when suddenly he heard a great thundering sound  'the cobs are coming' he said  'they didn't believe a word i told them  the cobs'll be carrying off the princess from under their stupid noses  but they shan't that they shan't'  he jumped up as he thought and began to dress but to his dismay found that he was still lying in bed  'now then i will' he said  'here goes  i am up now'  but yet again he found himself snug in bed  twenty times he tried and twenty times he failed for in fact he was not awake only dreaming that he was  at length in an agony of despair fancying he heard the goblins all over the house he gave a great cry  then there came as he thought a hand upon the lock of his door  it opened and looking up he saw a lady with white hair carrying a silver box in her hand enter the room  she came to his bed he thought stroked his head and face with cool soft hands took the dressing from his leg rubbed it with something that smelt like roses and then waved her hands over him three times  at the last wave of her hands everything vanished he felt himself sinking into the profoundest slumber and remembered nothing more until he awoke in earnest  the setting moon was throwing a feeble light through the casement and the house was full of uproar  there was soft heavy multitudinous stamping a clashing and clanging of weapons the voices of men and the cries of women mixed with a hideous bellowing which sounded victorious  the cobs were in the house he sprang from his bed hurried on some of his clothes not forgetting his shoes which were armed with nails then spying an old hunting-knife or short sword hanging on the wall he caught it and rushed down the stairs guided by the sounds of strife which grew louder and louder  when he reached the ground floor he found the whole place swarming  all the goblins of the mountain seemed gathered there  he rushed amongst them shouting     'one two   hit and hew   three four   blast and bore'  and with every rhyme he came down a great stamp upon a foot cutting at the same time their faces executing indeed a sword dance of the wildest description  away scattered the goblins in every direction into closets up stairs into chimneys up on rafters and down to the cellars  curdie went on stamping and slashing and singing but saw nothing of the people of the house until he came to the great hall in which the moment he entered it arose a great goblin shout the last of the men-at-arms the captain himself was on the floor buried beneath a wallowing crowd of goblins  for while each knight was busy defending himself as well as he could by stabs in the thick bodies of the goblins for he had soon found their heads all but invulnerable the queen had attacked his legs and feet with her horrible granite shoe and he was soon down but the captain had got his back to the wall and stood out longer  the goblins would have torn them all to pieces but the king had given orders to carry them away alive and over each of them in twelve groups was standing a knot of goblins while as many as could find room were sitting upon their prostrate bodies  curdie burst in dancing and gyrating and stamping and singing like a small incarnate whirlwind    'where 'tis all a hole sir   never can be holes    why should their shoes have soles sir   when they've got no souls    'but she upon her foot sir   has a granite shoe    the strongest leather boot sir   six would soon be through'   the queen gave a howl of rage and dismay and before she recovered her presence of mind curdie having begun with the group nearest him had eleven of the knights on their legs again  'stamp on their feet' he cried as each man rose and in a few minutes the hall was nearly empty the goblins running from it as fast as they could howling and shrieking and limping and cowering every now and then as they ran to cuddle their wounded feet in their hard hands or to protect them from the frightful stamp-stamp of the armed men  and now curdie approached the group which in trusting in the queen and her shoe kept their guard over the prostrate captain  the king sat on the captain's head but the queen stood in front like an infuriated cat with her perpendicular eyes gleaming green and her hair standing half up from her horrid head  her heart was quaking however and she kept moving about her skin-shod foot with nervous apprehension  when curdie was within a few paces she rushed at him made one tremendous stamp at his opposing foot which happily he withdrew in time and caught him round the waist to dash him on the marble floor  but just as she caught him he came down with all the weight of his iron-shod shoe upon her skin-shod foot and with a hideous howl she dropped him squatted on the floor and took her foot in both her hands  meanwhile the rest rushed on the king and the bodyguard sent them flying and lifted the prostrate captain who was all but pressed to death  it was some moments before he recovered breath and consciousness  'where's the princess' cried curdie again and again  no one knew and off they all rushed in search of her  through every room in the house they went but nowhere was she to be found  neither was one of the servants to be seen  but curdie who had kept to the lower part of the house which was now quiet enough began to hear a confused sound as of a distant hubbub and set out to find where it came from  the noise grew as his sharp ears guided him to a stair and so to the wine cellar  it was full of goblins whom the butler was supplying with wine as fast as he could draw it  while the queen and her party had encountered the men-at-arms harelip with another company had gone off to search the house they captured every one they met and when they could find no more they hurried away to carry them safe to the caverns below  but when the butler who was amongst them found that their path lay through the wine cellar he bethought himself of persuading them to taste the wine and as he had hoped they no sooner tasted than they wanted more  the routed goblins on their way below joined them and when curdie entered they were all with outstretched hands in which were vessels of every description from sauce pan to silver cup pressing around the butler who sat at the tap of a huge cask filling and filling  curdie cast one glance around the place before commencing his attack and saw in the farthest corner a terrified group of the domestics unwatched but cowering without courage to attempt their escape  amongst them was the terror-stricken face of lootie but nowhere could he see the princess seized with the horrible conviction that harelip had already carried her off he rushed amongst them unable for wrath to sing any more but stamping and cutting with greater fury than ever  'stamp on their feet stamp on their feet' he shouted and in a moment the goblins were disappearing through the hole in the floor like rats and mice  they could not vanish so fast however but that many more goblin feet had to go limping back over the underground ways of the mountain that morning  presently however they were reinforced from above by the king and his party with the redoubtable queen at their head  finding curdie again busy amongst her unfortunate subjects she rushed at him once more with the rage of despair and this time gave him a bad bruise on the foot then a regular stamping fight got up between them curdie with the point of his hunting-knife keeping her from clasping her mighty arms about him as he watched his opportunity of getting once more a good stamp at her skin-shod foot  but the queen was more wary as well as more agile than hitherto  the rest meantime finding their adversary thus matched for the moment paused in their headlong hurry and turned to the shivering group of women in the corner  as if determined to emulate his father and have a sun-woman of some sort to share his future throne harelip rushed at them caught up lootie and sped with her to the hole  she gave a great shriek and curdie heard her and saw the plight she was in gathering all his strength he gave the queen a sudden cut across the face with his weapon came down as she started back with all his weight on the proper foot and sprung to lootie's rescue  the prince had two defenceless feet and on both of them curdie stamped just as he reached the hole  he dropped his burden and rolled shrieking into the earth  curdie made one stab at him as he disappeared caught hold of the senseless lootie and having dragged her back to the corner there mounted guard over her preparing once more to encounter the queen  her face streaming with blood and her eyes flashing green lightning through it she came on with her mouth open and her teeth grinning like a tiger's followed by the king and her bodyguard of the thickest goblins  but the same moment in rushed the captain and his men and ran at them stamping furiously  they dared not encounter such an onset  away they scurried the queen foremost of course the right thing would have been to take the king and queen prisoners and hold them hostages for the princess but they were so anxious to find her that no one thought of detaining them until it was too late  having thus rescued the servants they set about searching the house once more  none of them could give the least information concerning the princess  lootie was almost silly with terror and although scarcely able to walk would not leave curdie's side for a single moment  again he allowed the others to search the rest of the house where except a dismayed goblin lurking here and there they found no one while he requested lootie to take him to the princess's room  she was as submissive and obedient as if he had been the king  he found the bedclothes tossed about and most of them on the floor while the princess's garments were scattered all over the room which was in the greatest confusion  it was only too evident that the goblins had been there and curdie had no longer any doubt that she had been carried off at the very first of the inroad with a pang of despair he saw how wrong they had been in not securing the king and queen and prince but he determined to find and rescue the princess as she had found and rescued him or meet the worst fate to which the goblins could doom him    chapter 28  curdie's guide  just as the consolation of this resolve dawned upon his mind and he was turning away for the cellar to follow the goblins into their hole something touched his hand  it was the slightest touch and when he looked he could see nothing  feeling and peering about in the grey of the dawn his fingers came upon a tight thread  he looked again and narrowly but still could see nothing  it flashed upon him that this must be the princess's thread  without saying a word for he knew no one would believe him any more than he had believed the princess he followed the thread with his finger contrived to give lootie the slip and was soon out of the house and on the mountainside surprised that if the thread were indeed the grandmother's messenger it should have led the princess as he supposed it must into the mountain where she would be certain to meet the goblins rushing back enraged from their defeat  but he hurried on in the hope of overtaking her first  when he arrived however at the place where the path turned off for the mine he found that the thread did not turn with it but went straight up the mountain  could it be that the thread was leading him home to his mother's cottage  could the princess be there  he bounded up the mountain like one of its own goats and before the sun was up the thread had brought him indeed to his mother's door  there it vanished from his fingers and he could not find it search as he might  the door was on the latch and he entered  there sat his mother by the fire and in her arms lay the princess fast asleep  'hush curdie' said his mother  'do not wake her  i'm so glad you're come  i thought the cobs must have got you again'  with a heart full of delight curdie sat down at a corner of the hearth on a stool opposite his mother's chair and gazed at the princess who slept as peacefully as if she had been in her own bed all at once she opened her eyes and fixed them on him  'oh curdie you're come' she said quietly  'i thought you would'  curdie rose and stood before her with downcast eyes  'irene' he said 'i am very sorry i did not believe you'  'oh never mind curdie' answered the princess  'you couldn't you know  you do believe me now don't you'  'i can't help it now  i ought to have helped it before'  'why can't you help it now'  'because just as i was going into the mountain to look for you i got hold of your thread and it brought me here'  'then you've come from my house have you'  'yes i have'  'i didn't know you were there'  'i've been there two or three days i believe'  'and i never knew it  then perhaps you can tell me why my grandmother has brought me here  i can't think  something woke me i didn't know what but i was frightened and i felt for the thread and there it was  i was more frightened still when it brought me out on the mountain for i thought it was going to take me into it again and i like the outside of it best  i supposed you were in trouble again and i had to get you out  but it brought me here instead and oh curdie your mother has been so kind to me just like my own grandmother'  here curdie's mother gave the princess a hug and the princess turned and gave her a sweet smile and held up her mouth to kiss her  'then you didn't see the cobs'asked curdie  'no i haven't been into the mountain i told you curdie'  'but the cobs have been into your house all over it and into your bedroom making such a row'  'what did they want there  it was very rude of them'  'they wanted you to carry you off into the mountain with them for a wife to their prince harelip'  'oh how dreadful' cried the princess shuddering  'but you needn't be afraid you know  your grandmother takes care of you'  'ah you do believe in my grandmother then  i'm so glad  she made me think you would some day'  all at once curdie remembered his dream and was silent thinking  'but how did you come to be in my house and me not know it' asked the princess  then curdie had to explain everything how he had watched for her sake how he had been wounded and shut up by the soldiers how he heard the noises and could not rise and how the beautiful old lady had come to him and all that followed  'poor curdie to lie there hurt and ill and me never to know it' exclaimed the princess stroking his rough hand  'i would have come and nursed you if they had told me'  'i didn't see you were lame' said his mother  'am i mother  oh yes i suppose i ought to be i declare i've never thought of it since i got up to go down amongst the cobs'  'let me see the wound' said his mother  he pulled down his stocking when behold except a great scar his leg was perfectly sound  curdie and his mother gazed in each other's eyes full of wonder but irene called out   'i thought so curdie  i was sure it wasn't a dream  i was sure my grandmother had been to see you  don't you smell the roses  it was my grandmother healed your leg and sent you to help me'  'no princess irene' said curdie 'i wasn't good enough to be allowed to help you  i didn't believe you  your grandmother took care of you without me'  'she sent you to help my people anyhow  i wish my king-papa would come  i do want so to tell him how good you have been'  'but' said the mother 'we are forgetting how frightened your people must be  you must take the princess home at once curdie or at least go and tell them where she is'  'yes mother  only i'm dreadfully hungry  do let me have some breakfast first  they ought to have listened to me and then they wouldn't have been taken by surprise as they were'  'that is true curdie but it is not for you to blame them much you remember'  'yes mother i do  only i must really have something to eat'  'you shall my boy as fast as i can get it' said his mother rising and setting the princess on her chair  but before his breakfast was ready curdie jumped up so suddenly as to startle both his companions  'mother mother' he cried 'i was forgetting  you must take the princess home yourself  i must go and wake my father'  without a word of explanation he rushed to the place where his father was sleeping  having thoroughly roused him with what he told him he darted out of the cottage    chapter 29  masonwork  he had all at once remembered the resolution of the goblins to carry out their second plan upon the failure of the first  no doubt they were already busy and the mine was therefore in the greatest danger of being flooded and rendered useless not to speak of the lives of the miners  when he reached the mouth of the mine after rousing all the miners within reach he found his father and a good many more just entering they all hurried to the gang by which he had found a way into the goblin country  there the foresight of peter had already collected a great many blocks of stone with cement ready for building up the weak place well enough known to the goblins although there was not room for more than two to be actually building at once they managed by setting all the rest to work in preparing the cement and passing the stones to finish in the course of the day a huge buttress filling the whole gang and supported everywhere by the live rock  before the hour when they usually dropped work they were satisfied the mine was secure  they had heard goblin hammers and pickaxes busy all the time and at length fancied they heard sounds of water they had never heard before but that was otherwise accounted for when they left the mine for they stepped out into a tremendous storm which was raging all over the mountain  the thunder was bellowing and the lightning lancing out of a huge black cloud which lay above it and hung down  its edges of thick mist over its sides  the lightning was breaking out of the mountain too and flashing up into the cloud  from the state of the brooks now swollen into raging torrents it was evident that the storm had been storming all day  the wind was blowing as if it would blow him off the mountain but anxious about his mother and the princess curdie darted up through the thick of the tempest  even if they had not set out before the storm came on he did not judge them safe for in such a storm even their poor little house was in danger  indeed he soon found that but for a huge rock against which it was built and which protected it both from the blasts and the waters it must have been swept if it was not blown away for the two torrents into which this rock parted the rush of water behind it united again in front of the cottage two roaring and dangerous streams which his mother and the princess could not possibly have passed  it was with great difficulty that he forced his way through one of them and up to the door  the moment his hand fell on the latch through all the uproar of winds and waters came the joyous cry of the princess   'there's curdie  curdie  curdie'  she was sitting wrapped in blankets on the bed his mother trying for the hundredth time to light the fire which had been drowned by the rain that came down the chimney  the clay floor was one mass of mud and the whole place looked wretched  but the faces of the mother and the princess shone as if their troubles only made them the merrier  curdie burst out laughing at the sight of them  'i never had such fun' said the princess her eyes twinkling and her pretty teeth shining  'how nice it must be to live in a cottage on the mountain'  'it all depends on what kind your inside house is' said the mother  'i know what you mean' said irene  'that's the kind of thing my grandmother says'  by the time peter returned the storm was nearly over but the streams were so fierce and so swollen that it was not only out of the question for the princess to go down the mountain but most dangerous for peter even or curdie to make the attempt in the gathering darkness  'they will be dreadfully frightened about you' said peter to the princess 'but we cannot help it  we must wait till the morning'  with curdie's help the fire was lighted at last and the mother set about making their supper and after supper they all told the princess stories till she grew sleepy  then curdie's mother laid her in curdie's bed which was in a tiny little garret-room  as soon as she was in bed through a little window low down in the roof she caught sight of her grandmother's lamp shining far away beneath and she gazed at the beautiful silvery globe until she fell asleep    chapter 30  the king and the kiss  the next morning the sun rose so bright that irene said the rain had washed his face and let the light out clean  the torrents were still roaring down the side of the mountain but they were so much smaller as not to be dangerous in the daylight  after an early breakfast peter went to his work and curdie and his mother set out to take the princess home  they had difficulty in getting her dry across the streams and curdie had again and again to carry her but at last they got safe on the broader part of the road and walked gently down towards the king's house  and what should they see as they turned the last corner but the last of the king's troop riding through the gate  'oh curdie' cried irene clapping her hands right joyfully'my king-papa is come'  the moment curdie heard that he caught her up in his arms and set off at full speed crying   'come on mother dear  the king may break his heart before he knows that she is safe'  irene clung round his neck and he ran with her like a deer  when he entered the gate into the court there sat the king on his horse with all the people of the house about him weeping and hanging their heads the king was not weeping but his face was white as a dead man's and he looked as if the life had gone out of him  the men-at-arms he had brought with him sat with horror-stricken faces but eyes flashing with rage waiting only for the word of the king to do something they did not know what and nobody knew what  the day before the men-at-arms belonging to the house as soon as they were satisfied the princess had been carried away rushed after the goblins into the hole but found that they had already so skilfully blockaded the narrowest part not many feet below the cellar that without miners and their tools they could do nothing not one of them knew where the mouth of the mine lay and some of those who had set out to find it had been overtaken by the storm and had not even yet returned  poor sir walter was especially filled with shame and almost hoped the king would order his head to be cut off for to think of that sweet little face down amongst the goblins was unendurable  when curdie ran in at the gate with the princess in his arms they were all so absorbed in their own misery and awed by the king's presence and grief that no one observed his arrival  he went straight up to the king where he sat on his horse  'papa papa' the princess cried stretching out her arms to him 'here i am'  the king started  the colour rushed to his face  he gave an inarticulate cry  curdie held up the princess and the king bent down and took her from his arms  as he clasped her to his bosom the big tears went dropping down his cheeks and his beard  and such a shout arose from all the bystanders that the startled horses pranced and capered and the armour rang and clattered and the rocks of the mountain echoed back the noises  the princess greeted them all as she nestled in her father's bosom and the king did not set her down until she had told them all the story  but she had more to tell about curdie than about herself and what she did tell about herself none of them could understand except the king and curdie who stood by the king's knee stroking the neck of the great white horse  and still as she told what curdie had done sir walter and others added to what she told even lootie joining in the praises of his courage and energy  curdie held his peace looking quietly up in the king's face  and his mother stood on the outskirts of the crowd listening with delight for her son's deeds were pleasant in her ears until the princess caught sight of her  'and there is his mother king-papa' she said  'see there  she is such a nice mother and has been so kind to me'  they all parted asunder as the king made a sign to her to come forward she obeyed and he gave her his hand but could not speak  'and now king-papa' the princess went on 'i must tell you another thing  one night long ago curdie drove the goblins away and brought lootie and me safe from the mountain  and i promised him a kiss when we got home but lootie wouldn't let me give it him  i don't want you to scold lootie but i want you to tell her that a princess must do as she promises'  'indeed she must my child except it be wrong' said the king 'there give curdie a kiss'  and as he spoke he held her towards him  the princess reached down threw her arms round curdie's neck and kissed him on the mouth saying  'there curdie  there's the kiss i promised you'  then they all went into the house and the cook rushed to the kitchen and the servants to their work  lootie dressed irene in her shiningest clothes and the king put off his armour and put on purple and gold and a messenger was sent for peter and all the miners and there was a great and a grand feast which continued long after the princess was put to bed    chapter 31  the subterranean waters  the king's harper who always formed a part of his escort was chanting a ballad which he made as he went on playing on his instrument about the princess and the goblins and the prowess of curdie when all at once he ceased with his eyes on one of the doors of the hall thereupon the eyes of the king and his guests turned thitherward also the next moment through the open doorway came the princess irene  she went straight up to her father with her right hand stretched out a little sideways and her forefinger as her father and curdie understood feeling its way along the invisible thread  the king took her on his knee and she said in his ear   'king-papa do you hear that noise'  'i hear nothing' said the king  'listen' she said holding up her forefinger  the king listened and a great stillness fell upon the company each man seeing that the king listened listened also and the harper sat with his harp between his arms and his finger silent upon the strings  'i do hear a noise' said the king at length 'a noise as of distant thunder  it is coming nearer and nearer  what can it be'  they all heard it now and each seemed ready to start to his feet as he listened  yet all sat perfectly still  the noise came rapidly nearer  'what can it be' said the king again  'i think it must be another storm coming over the mountain' said sir walter  then curdie who at the first word of the king had slipped from his seat and laid his ear to the ground rose up quickly and approaching the king said speaking very fast   'please your majesty i think i know what it is  i have no time to explain for that might make it too late for some of us  will your majesty give orders that everybody leave the house as quickly as possible and get up the mountain'  the king who was the wisest man in the kingdom knew well there was a time when things must be done and questions left till afterwards  he had faith in curdie and rose instantly with irene in his arms 'every man and woman follow me' he said and strode out into the darkness  before he had reached the gate the noise had grown to a great thundering roar and the ground trembled beneath their feet and before the last of them had crossed the court out after them from the great hall door came a huge rush of turbid water and almost swept them away but they got safe out of the gate and up the mountain while the torrent went roaring down the road into the valley beneath  curdie had left the king and the princess to look after his mother whom he and his father one on each side caught up when the stream overtook them and carried safe and dry  when the king had got out of the way of the water a little up the mountain he stood with the princess in his arms looking back with amazement on the issuing torrent which glimmered fierce and foamy through the night  there curdie rejoined them  'now curdie' said the king 'what does it mean  is this what you expected'  'it is your majesty' said curdie and proceeded to tell him about the second scheme of the goblins who fancying the miners of more importance to the upper world than they were had resolved if they should fail in carrying off the king's daughter to flood the mine and drown the miners  then he explained what the miners had done to prevent it  the goblins had in pursuance of their design let loose all the underground reservoirs and streams expecting the water to run down into the mine which was lower than their part of the mountain for they had as they supposed not knowing of the solid wall close behind broken a passage through into it  but the readiest outlet the water could find had turned out to be the tunnel they had made to the king's house the possibility of which catastrophe had not occurred to the young miner until he had laid his ear to the floor of the hall  what was then to be done  the house appeared in danger of falling and every moment the torrent was increasing  'we must set out at once' said the king  'but how to get at the horses'  'shall i see if we can manage that' said curdie  'do' said the king  curdie gathered the men-at-arms and took them over the garden wall and so to the stables  they found their horses in terror the water was rising fast around them and it was quite time they were got out but there was no way to get them out except by riding them through the stream which was now pouring from the lower windows as well as the door  as one horse was quite enough for any man to manage through such a torrent curdie got on the king's white charger and leading the way brought them all in safety to the rising ground  'look look curdie' cried irene the moment that having dismounted he led the horse up to the king  curdie did look and saw high in the air somewhere about the top of the king's house a great globe of light shining like the purest silver  'oh' he cried in some consternation 'that is your grandmother's lamp we must get her out  i will go an find her  the house may fall you know'  'my grandmother is in no danger' said irene smiling  'here curdie take the princess while i get on my horse' said the king  curdie took the princess again and both turned their eyes to the globe of light  the same moment there shot from it a white bird which descending with outstretched wings made one circle round the king an curdie and the princess and then glided up again  the light and the pigeon vanished together  'now curdie' said the princess as he lifted her to her father's arms 'you see my grandmother knows all about it and isn't frightened i believe she could walk through that water and it wouldn't wet her a bit'  'but my child' said the king 'you will be cold if you haven't something more on  run curdie my boy and fetch anything you can lay your hands on to keep the princess warm  we have a long ride before us'  curdie was gone in a moment and soon returned with a great rich fur and the news that dead goblins were tossing about in the current through the house  they had been caught in their own snare instead of the mine they had flooded their own country whence they were now swept up drowned  irene shuddered but the king held her close to his bosom then he turned to sir walter and said   'bring curdie's father and mother here'  'i wish' said the king when they stood before him 'to take your son with me  he shall enter my bodyguard at once and wait further promotion'  peter and his wife overcome only murmured almost inaudible thanks but curdie spoke aloud  'please your majesty' he said 'i cannot leave my father and mother'  'that's right curdie' cried the princess  'i wouldn't if i was you'  the king looked at the princess and then at curdie with a glow of satisfaction on his countenance  'i too think you are right curdie' he said 'and i will not ask you again  but i shall have a chance of doing something for you some time'  'your majesty has already allowed me to serve you' said curdie  'but curdie' said his mother 'why shouldn't you go with the king we can get on very well without you'  'but i can't get on very well without you' said curdie  'the king is very kind but i could not be half the use to him that i am to you please your majesty if you wouldn't mind giving my mother a red petticoat  i should have got her one long ago but for the goblins'  'as soon as we get home' said the king 'irene and i will search out the warmest one to be found and send it by one of the gentlemen'  'yes that we will curdie' said the princess  'and next summer we'll come back and see you wear it curdie's mother' she added 'shan't we king-papa'  'yes my love i hope so' said the king  then turning to the miners he said   'will you do the best you can for my servants tonight  i hope they will be able to return to the house tomorrow'  the miners with one voice promised their hospitality then the king commanded his servants to mind whatever curdie should say to them and after shaking hands with him and his father and mother the king and the princess and all their company rode away down the side of the new stream which had already devoured half the road into the starry night    chapter 32  the last chapter  all the rest went up the mountain and separated in groups to the homes of the miners  curdie and his father and mother took lootie with them and the whole way a light of which all but lootie understood the origin shone upon their path  but when they looked round they could see nothing of the silvery globe  for days and days the water continued to rush from the doors and windows of the king's house and a few goblin bodies were swept out into the road  curdie saw that something must be done  he spoke to his father and the rest of the miners and they at once proceeded to make another outlet for the waters  by setting all hands to the work tunnelling here and building there they soon succeeded and having also made a little tunnel to drain the water away from under the king's house they were soon able to get into the wine cellar where they found a multitude of dead goblins among the rest the queen with the skin-shoe gone and the stone one fast to her ankle for the water had swept away the barricade which prevented the men-at-arms from following the goblins and had greatly widened the passage  they built it securely up and then went back to their labours in the mine  a good many of the goblins with their creatures escaped from the inundation out upon the mountain  but most of them soon left that part of the country and most of those who remained grew milder in character and indeed became very much like the scotch brownies their skulls became softer as well as their hearts and their feet grew harder and by degrees they became friendly with the inhabitants of the mountain and even with the miners  but the latter were merciless to any of the cobs' creatures that came in their way until at length they all but disappeared  the rest of the history of the princess and curdie must be kept for another volume"@"The Princess and the Goblin"@"George MacDonald"
