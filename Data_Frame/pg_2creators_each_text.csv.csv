manufactures a pumpkinhead   in the country of the gillikins which is at the north of the land of oz lived a youth called tip there was more to his name than that for old mombi often declared that his whole name was tippetarius but no one was expected to say such a long word when tip would do just as well  this boy remembered nothing of his parents for he had been brought when quite young to be reared by the old woman known as mombi whose reputation i am sorry to say was none of the best for the gillikin people had reason to suspect her of indulging in magical arts and therefore hesitated to associate with her  [illustration  image016]  mombi was not exactly a witch because the good witch who ruled that part of the land of oz had forbidden any other witch to exist in her dominions so tip’s guardian however much she might aspire to working magic realized it was unlawful to be more than a sorceress or at most a wizardess  tip was made to carry wood from the forest that the old woman might boil her pot he also worked in the corn-fields hoeing and husking and he fed the pigs and milked the four-horned cow that was mombi’s especial pride  but you must not suppose he worked all the time for he felt that would be bad for him when sent to the forest tip often climbed trees for birds’ eggs or amused himself chasing the fleet white rabbits or fishing in the brooks with bent pins then he would hastily gather his armful of wood and carry it home and when he was supposed to be working in the corn-fields and the tall stalks hid him from mombi’s view tip would often dig in the gopher holes or if the mood seized him—lie upon his back between the rows of corn and take a nap so by taking care not to exhaust his strength he grew as strong and rugged as a boy may be  mombi’s curious magic often frightened her neighbors and they treated her shyly yet respectfully because of her weird powers but tip frankly hated her and took no pains to hide his feelings indeed he sometimes showed less respect for the old woman than he should have done considering she was his guardian  there were pumpkins in mombi’s corn-fields lying golden red among the rows of green stalks and these had been planted and carefully tended that the four-horned cow might eat of them in the winter time but one day after the corn had all been cut and stacked and tip was carrying the pumpkins to the stable he took a notion to make a jack lantern and try to give the old woman a fright with it  [illustration  image017]  so he selected a fine big pumpkin—one with a lustrous orange-red color—and began carving it with the point of his knife he made two round eyes a three-cornered nose and a mouth shaped like a new moon the face when completed could not have been considered strictly beautiful but it wore a smile so big and broad and was so jolly in expression that even tip laughed as he looked admiringly at his work  the child had no playmates so he did not know that boys often dig out the inside of a pumpkin-jack and in the space thus made put a lighted candle to render the face more startling but he conceived an idea of his own that promised to be quite as effective he decided to manufacture the form of a man who would wear this pumpkin head and to stand it in a place where old mombi would meet it face to face  and then said tip to himself with a laugh she’ll squeal louder than the brown pig does when i pull her tail and shiver with fright worse than i did last year when i had the ague  he had plenty of time to accomplish this task for mombi had gone to a village—to buy groceries she said—and it was a journey of at least two days  [illustration  image019]  so he took his axe to the forest and selected some stout straight saplings which he cut down and trimmed of all their twigs and leaves from these he would make the arms and legs and feet of his man for the body he stripped a sheet of thick bark from around a big tree and with much labor fashioned it into a cylinder of about the right size pinning the edges together with wooden pegs then whistling happily as he worked he carefully jointed the limbs and fastened them to the body with pegs whittled into shape with his knife  by the time this feat had been accomplished it began to grow dark and tip remembered he must milk the cow and feed the pigs so he picked up his wooden man and carried it back to the house with him  during the evening by the light of the fire in the kitchen tip carefully rounded all the edges of the joints and smoothed the rough places in a neat and workmanlike manner then he stood the figure up against the wall and admired it it seemed remarkably tall even for a full-grown man but that was a good point in a small boy’s eyes and tip did not object at all to the size of his creation  next morning when he looked at his work again tip saw he had forgotten to give the dummy a neck by means of which he might fasten the pumpkinhead to the body so he went again to the forest which was not far away and chopped from a tree several pieces of wood with which to complete his work when he returned he fastened a cross-piece to the upper end of the body making a hole through the center to hold upright the neck the bit of wood which formed this neck was also sharpened at the upper end and when all was ready tip put on the pumpkin head pressing it well down onto the neck and found that it fitted very well the head could be turned to one side or the other as he pleased and the hinges of the arms and legs allowed him to place the dummy in any position he desired  now that declared tip proudly is really a very fine man and it ought to frighten several screeches out of old mombi but it would be much more lifelike if it were properly dressed  to find clothing seemed no easy task but tip boldly ransacked the great chest in which mombi kept all her keepsakes and treasures and at the very bottom he discovered some purple trousers a red shirt and a pink vest which was dotted with white spots these he carried away to his man and succeeded although the garments did not fit very well in dressing the creature in a jaunty fashion some knit stockings belonging to mombi and a much worn pair of his own shoes completed the man’s apparel and tip was so delighted that he danced up and down and laughed aloud in boyish ecstacy  i must give him a name he cried so good a man as this must surely have a name i believe he added after a moment’s thought i will name the fellow ‘jack pumpkinhead’  [illustration  image023]  [illustration  image024]  [illustration  image025]     the marvelous powder of life   after considering the matter carefully tip decided that the best place to locate jack would be at the bend in the road a little way from the house so he started to carry his man there but found him heavy and rather awkward to handle after dragging the creature a short distance tip stood him on his feet and by first bending the joints of one leg and then those of the other at the same time pushing from behind the boy managed to induce jack to walk to the bend in the road it was not accomplished without a few tumbles and tip really worked harder than he ever had in the fields or forest but a love of mischief urged him on and it pleased him to test the cleverness of his workmanship  jack’s all right and works fine he said to himself panting with the unusual exertion but just then he discovered the man’s left arm had fallen off in the journey so he went back to find it and afterward by whittling a new and stouter pin for the shoulder-joint he repaired the injury so successfully that the arm was stronger than before tip also noticed that jack’s pumpkin head had twisted around until it faced his back but this was easily remedied when at last the man was set up facing the turn in the path where old mombi was to appear he looked natural enough to be a fair imitation of a gillikin farmer—and unnatural enough to startle anyone that came on him unawares  as it was yet too early in the day to expect the old woman to return home tip went down into the valley below the farm-house and began to gather nuts from the trees that grew there  however old mombi returned earlier than usual she had met a crooked wizard who resided in a lonely cave in the mountains and had traded several important secrets of magic with him having in this way secured three new recipes four magical powders and a selection of herbs of wonderful power and potency she hobbled home as fast as she could in order to test her new sorceries  so intent was mombi on the treasures she had gained that when she turned the bend in the road and caught a glimpse of the man she merely nodded and said   good evening sir  but a moment after noting that the person did not move or reply she cast a shrewd glance into his face and discovered his pumpkin head elaborately carved by tip’s jack-knife  heh ejaculated mombi giving a sort of grunt that rascally boy has been playing tricks again very good ve—ry good i’ll beat him black-and-blue for trying to scare me in this fashion  angrily she raised her stick to smash in the grinning pumpkin head of the dummy but a sudden thought made her pause the uplifted stick left motionless in the air  why here is a good chance to try my new powder said she eagerly and then i can tell whether that crooked wizard has fairly traded secrets or whether he has fooled me as wickedly as i fooled him  so she set down her basket and began fumbling in it for one of the precious powders she had obtained  while mombi was thus occupied tip strolled back with his pockets full of nuts and discovered the old woman standing beside his man and apparently not the least bit frightened by it  at first he was generally disappointed but the next moment he became curious to know what mombi was going to do so he hid behind a hedge where he could see without being seen and prepared to watch  after some search the woman drew from her basket an old pepper-box upon the faded label of which the wizard had written with a lead-pencil   powder of life  ah—here it is she cried joyfully and now let us see if it is potent the stingy wizard didn’t give me much of it but i guess there’s enough for two or three doses  [illustration  image029]  tip was much surprised when he overheard this speech then he saw old mombi raise her arm and sprinkle the powder from the box over the pumpkin head of his man jack she did this in the same way one would pepper a baked potato and the powder sifted down from jack’s head and scattered over the red shirt and pink waistcoat and purple trousers tip had dressed him in and a portion even fell upon the patched and worn shoes  then putting the pepper-box back into the basket mombi lifted her left hand with its little finger pointed upward and said   weaugh  then she lifted her right hand with the thumb pointed upward and said   teaugh  then she lifted both hands with all the fingers and thumbs spread out and cried   peaugh  jack pumpkinhead stepped back a pace at this and said in a reproachful voice   don’t yell like that do you think i’m deaf  old mombi danced around him frantic with delight  he lives she screamed  he lives he lives  then she threw her stick into the air and caught it as it came down and she hugged herself with both arms and tried to do a step of a jig and all the time she repeated rapturously   he lives—he lives—he lives  now you may well suppose that tip observed all this with amazement  at first he was so frightened and horrified that he wanted to run away but his legs trembled and shook so badly that he couldn’t then it struck him as a very funny thing for jack to come to life especially as the expression on his pumpkin face was so droll and comical it excited laughter on the instant so recovering from his first fear tip began to laugh and the merry peals reached old mombi’s ears and made her hobble quickly to the hedge where she seized tip’s collar and dragged him back to where she had left her basket and the pumpkinheaded man  you naughty sneaking wicked boy she exclaimed furiously  i’ll teach you to spy out my secrets and to make fun of me  i wasn’t making fun of you protested tip i was laughing at old pumpkinhead look at him isn’t he a picture though  i hope you are not reflecting on my personal appearance said jack and it was so funny to hear his grave voice while his face continued to wear its jolly smile that tip again burst into a peal of laughter  [illustration  image032]  even mombi was not without a curious interest in the man her magic had brought to life for after staring at him intently she presently asked   what do you know  well that is hard to tell replied jack for although i feel that i know a tremendous lot i am not yet aware how much there is in the world to find out about it will take me a little time to discover whether i am very wise or very foolish  to be sure said mombi thoughtfully  but what are you going to do with him now he is alive asked tip wondering  i must think it over answered mombi but we must get home at once for it is growing dark help the pumpkinhead to walk  never mind me said jack i can walk as well as you can haven’t i got legs and feet and aren’t they jointed  are they asked the woman turning to tip  of course they are i made ’em myself returned the boy with pride  so they started for the house but when they reached the farm yard old mombi led the pumpkin man to the cow stable and shut him up in an empty stall fastening the door securely on the outside  i’ve got to attend to you first she said nodding her head at tip  hearing this the boy became uneasy for he knew mombi had a bad and revengeful heart and would not hesitate to do any evil thing  they entered the house it was a round domeshaped structure as are nearly all the farm houses in the land of oz  mombi bade the boy light a candle while she put her basket in a cupboard and hung her cloak on a peg tip obeyed quickly for he was afraid of her  after the candle had been lighted mombi ordered him to build a fire in the hearth and while tip was thus engaged the old woman ate her supper when the flames began to crackle the boy came to her and asked a share of the bread and cheese but mombi refused him  i’m hungry said tip in a sulky tone  you won’t be hungry long replied mombi with a grim look  the boy didn’t like this speech for it sounded like a threat but he happened to remember he had nuts in his pocket so he cracked some of those and ate them while the woman rose shook the crumbs from her apron and hung above the fire a small black kettle  then she measured out equal parts of milk and vinegar and poured them into the kettle next she produced several packets of herbs and powders and began adding a portion of each to the contents of the kettle occasionally she would draw near the candle and read from a yellow paper the recipe of the mess she was concocting  as tip watched her his uneasiness increased  what is that for he asked  for you returned mombi briefly  tip wriggled around upon his stool and stared awhile at the kettle which was beginning to bubble then he would glance at the stern and wrinkled features of the witch and wish he were any place but in that dim and smoky kitchen where even the shadows cast by the candle upon the wall were enough to give one the horrors so an hour passed away during which the silence was only broken by the bubbling of the pot and the hissing of the flames  finally tip spoke again  have i got to drink that stuff he asked nodding toward the pot  yes said mombi  what’ll it do to me asked tip  if it’s properly made replied mombi it will change or transform you into a marble statue  tip groaned and wiped the perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve  i don’t want to be a marble statue he protested  [illustration  image037]  that doesn’t matter i want you to be one said the old woman looking at him severely  what use’ll i be then asked tip there won’t be any one to work for you  i’ll make the pumpkinhead work for me said mombi  again tip groaned  why don’t you change me into a goat or a chicken he asked anxiously you can’t do anything with a marble statue  oh yes i can returned mombi i’m going to plant a flower garden next spring and i’ll put you in the middle of it for an ornament i wonder i haven’t thought of that before you’ve been a bother to me for years  at this terrible speech tip felt the beads of perspiration starting all over his body but he sat still and shivered and looked anxiously at the kettle  perhaps it won’t work he mutttered in a voice that sounded weak and discouraged  oh i think it will answered mombi cheerfully i seldom make a mistake  again there was a period of silence a silence so long and gloomy that when mombi finally lifted the kettle from the fire it was close to midnight  you cannot drink it until it has become quite cold announced the old witch for in spite of the law she had acknowledged practising witchcraft we must both go to bed now and at daybreak i will call you and at once complete your transformation into a marble statue  with this she hobbled into her room bearing the steaming kettle with her and tip heard her close and lock the door  the boy did not go to bed as he had been commanded to do but still sat glaring at the embers of the dying fire  [illustration  image038]  [illustration  image039]     the flight of the fugitives   tip reflected  it’s a hard thing to be a marble statue he thought rebelliously and i’m not going to stand it for years i’ve been a bother to her she says so she’s going to get rid of me well there’s an easier way than to become a statue no boy could have any fun forever standing in the middle of a flower garden i’ll run away that’s what i’ll do—and i may as well go before she makes me drink that nasty stuff in the kettle he waited until the snores of the old witch announced she was fast asleep and then he arose softly and went to the cupboard to find something to eat  no use starting on a journey without food he decided searching upon the narrow shelves  he found some crusts of bread but he had to look into mombi’s basket to find the cheese she had brought from the village while turning over the contents of the basket he came upon the pepper-box which contained the powder of life  i may as well take this with me he thought or mombi’ll be using it to make more mischief with so he put the box in his pocket together with the bread and cheese  then he cautiously left the house and latched the door behind him outside both moon and stars shone brightly and the night seemed peaceful and inviting after the close and ill-smelling kitchen  i’ll be glad to get away said tip softly for i never did like that old woman i wonder how i ever came to live with her  he was walking slowly toward the road when a thought made him pause  i don’t like to leave jack pumpkinhead to the tender mercies of old mombi he muttered and jack belongs to me for i made him even if the old witch did bring him to life  he retraced his steps to the cow-stable and opened the door of the stall where the pumpkin-headed man had been left  jack was standing in the middle of the stall and by the moonlight tip could see he was smiling just as jovially as ever  come on said the boy beckoning  where to asked jack  you’ll know as soon as i do answered tip smiling sympathetically into the pumpkin face  all we’ve got to do now is to tramp  very well returned jack and walked awkwardly out of the stable and into the moonlight  tip turned toward the road and the man followed him jack walked with a sort of limp and occasionally one of the joints of his legs would turn backward instead of frontwise almost causing him to tumble but the pumpkinhead was quick to notice this and began to take more pains to step carefully so that he met with few accidents  [illustration  image041]  tip led him along the path without stopping an instant they could not go very fast but they walked steadily and by the time the moon sank away and the sun peeped over the hills they had travelled so great a distance that the boy had no reason to fear pursuit from the old witch moreover he had turned first into one path and then into another so that should anyone follow them it would prove very difficult to guess which way they had gone or where to seek them  fairly satisfied that he had escaped—for a time at least—being turned into a marble statue the boy stopped his companion and seated himself upon a rock by the roadside  let’s have some breakfast he said  jack pumpkinhead watched tip curiously but refused to join in the repast i don’t seem to be made the same way you are he said  i know you are not returned tip for i made you  oh did you asked jack  [illustration  image043]  certainly and put you together and carved your eyes and nose and ears and mouth said tip proudly and dressed you  jack looked at his body and limbs critically  it strikes me you made a very good job of it he remarked  just so-so replied tip modestly for he began to see certain defects in the construction of his man if i’d known we were going to travel together i might have been a little more particular  why then said the pumpkinhead in a tone that expressed surprise you must be my creator my parent my father  or your inventor replied the boy with a laugh yes my son i really believe i am  then i owe you obedience continued the man and you owe me—support  that’s it exactly declared tip jumping up so let us be off  where are we going asked jack when they had resumed their journey  i’m not exactly sure said the boy but i believe we are headed south and that will bring us sooner or later to the emerald city  what city is that enquired the pumpkinhead  why it’s the center of the land of oz and the biggest town in all the country i’ve never been there myself but i’ve heard all about its history it was built by a mighty and wonderful wizard named oz and everything there is of a green color—just as everything in this country of the gillikins is of a purple color  is everything here purple asked jack  of course it is can’t you see returned the boy  i believe i must be color-blind said the pumpkinhead after staring about him  well the grass is purple and the trees are purple and the houses and fences are purple explained tip even the mud in the roads is purple but in the emerald city everything is green that is purple here and in the country of the munchkins over at the east everything is blue and in the south country of the quadlings everything is red and in the west country of the winkies where the tin woodman rules everything is yellow  oh said jack then after a pause he asked  did you say a tin woodman rules the winkies  yes he was one of those who helped dorothy to destroy the wicked witch of the west and the winkies were so grateful that they invited him to become their ruler—just as the people of the emerald city invited the scarecrow to rule them  dear me said jack i’m getting confused with all this history who is the scarecrow  another friend of dorothy’s replied tip  and who is dorothy  she was a girl that came here from kansas a place in the big outside world she got blown to the land of oz by a cyclone and while she was here the scarecrow and the tin woodman accompanied her on her travels  and where is she now inquired the pumpkinhead  glinda the good who rules the quadlings sent her home again said the boy  oh and what became of the scarecrow  i told you he rules the emerald city answered tip  i thought you said it was ruled by a wonderful wizard objected jack seeming more and more confused  well so i did now pay attention and i’ll explain it said tip speaking slowly and looking the smiling pumpkinhead squarely in the eye dorothy went to the emerald city to ask the wizard to send her back to kansas and the scarecrow and the tin woodman went with her but the wizard couldn’t send her back because he wasn’t so much of a wizard as he might have been and then they got angry at the wizard and threatened to expose him so the wizard made a big balloon and escaped in it and no one has ever seen him since  now that is very interesting history said jack well pleased and i understand it perfectly all but the explanation  i’m glad you do responded tip after the wizard was gone the people of the emerald city made his majesty the scarecrow their king and i have heard that he became a very popular ruler  are we going to see this queer king asked jack with interest  i think we may as well replied the boy unless you have something better to do  oh no dear father said the pumpkinhead i am quite willing to go wherever you please  [illustration  image047]  [illustration  image048]  [illustration  image049]     tip makes an experiment in magic   the boy small and rather delicate in appearance seemed somewhat embarrassed at being called father by the tall awkward pumpkinheaded man but to deny the relationship would involve another long and tedious explanation so he changed the subject by asking abruptly   are you tired  of course not replied the other but he continued after a pause it is quite certain i shall wear out my wooden joints if i keep on walking  tip reflected as they journeyed on that this was true he began to regret that he had not constructed the wooden limbs more carefully and substantially yet how could he ever have guessed that the man he had made merely to scare old mombi with would be brought to life by means of a magical powder contained in an old pepper-box  so he ceased to reproach himself and began to think how he might yet remedy the deficiencies of jack’s weak joints  while thus engaged they came to the edge of a wood and the boy sat down to rest upon an old sawhorse that some woodcutter had left there  why don’t you sit down he asked the pumpkinhead  won’t it strain my joints inquired the other  of course not it’ll rest them declared the boy  so jack tried to sit down but as soon as he bent his joints farther than usual they gave way altogether and he came clattering to the ground with such a crash that tip feared he was entirely ruined  [illustration  image050]  he rushed to the man lifted him to his feet straightened his arms and legs and felt of his head to see if by chance it had become cracked but jack seemed to be in pretty good shape after all and tip said to him   i guess you’d better remain standing hereafter it seems the safest way  very well dear father just as you say replied the smiling jack who had been in no wise confused by his tumble  tip sat down again presently the pumpkinhead asked   what is that thing you are sitting on  oh this is a horse replied the boy carelessly  what is a horse demanded jack  a horse why there are two kinds of horses returned tip slightly puzzled how to explain one kind of horse is alive and has four legs and a head and a tail and people ride upon its back  i understand said jack cheerfully that’s the kind of horse you are now sitting on  no it isn’t answered tip promptly  why not that one has four legs and a head and a tail tip looked at the saw-horse more carefully and found that the pumpkinhead was right the body had been formed from a tree-trunk and a branch had been left sticking up at one end that looked very much like a tail in the other end were two big knots that resembled eyes and a place had been chopped away that might easily be mistaken for the horse’s mouth as for the legs they were four straight limbs cut from trees and stuck fast into the body being spread wide apart so that the saw-horse would stand firmly when a log was laid across it to be sawed  this thing resembles a real horse more than i imagined said tip trying to explain but a real horse is alive and trots and prances and eats oats while this is nothing more than a dead horse made of wood and used to saw logs upon  if it were alive wouldn’t it trot and prance and eat oats inquired the pumpkinhead  it would trot and prance perhaps but it wouldn’t eat oats replied the boy laughing at the idea and of course it can’t ever be alive because it is made of wood  so am i answered the man  tip looked at him in surprise  why so you are he exclaimed and the magic powder that brought you to life is here in my pocket  [illustration  image053]  he brought out the pepper box and eyed it curiously  i wonder said he musingly if it would bring the saw-horse to life  if it would returned jack calmly for nothing seemed to surprise him i could ride on its back and that would save my joints from wearing out  i’ll try it cried the boy jumping up but i wonder if i can remember the words old mombi said and the way she held her hands up  he thought it over for a minute and as he had watched carefully from the hedge every motion of the old witch and listened to her words he believed he could repeat exactly what she had said and done  so he began by sprinkling some of the magic powder of life from the pepper-box upon the body of the saw-horse then he lifted his left hand with the little finger pointing upward and said  weaugh  what does that mean dear father asked jack curiously  i don’t know answered tip then he lifted his right hand with the thumb pointing upward and said  teaugh  what’s that dear father inquired jack  it means you must keep quiet replied the boy provoked at being interrupted at so important a moment  how fast i am learning remarked the pumpkinhead with his eternal smile  tip now lifted both hands above his head with all the fingers and thumbs spread out and cried in a loud voice  peaugh  immediately the saw-horse moved stretched its legs yawned with its chopped-out mouth and shook a few grains of the powder off its back the rest of the powder seemed to have vanished into the body of the horse  good called jack while the boy looked on in astonishment you are a very clever sorcerer dear father  [illustration  image055]  [illustration  image056]  [illustration  image057]     the awakening of the saw-horse   the saw-horse finding himself alive seemed even more astonished than tip he rolled his knotty eyes from side to side taking a first wondering view of the world in which he had now so important an existence then he tried to look at himself but he had indeed no neck to turn so that in the endeavor to see his body he kept circling around and around without catching even a glimpse of it his legs were stiff and awkward for there were no knee-joints in them so that presently he bumped against jack pumpkinhead and sent that personage tumbling upon the moss that lined the roadside  tip became alarmed at this accident as well as at the persistence of the saw-horse in prancing around in a circle so he called out   whoa whoa there  the saw-horse paid no attention whatever to this command and the next instant brought one of his wooden legs down upon tip’s foot so forcibly that the boy danced away in pain to a safer distance from where he again yelled   whoa whoa i say  jack had now managed to raise himself to a sitting position and he looked at the saw-horse with much interest  i don’t believe the animal can hear you he remarked  i shout loud enough don’t i answered tip angrily  yes but the horse has no ears said the smiling pumpkinhead  sure enough exclaimed tip noting the fact for the first time how then am i going to stop him  but at that instant the saw-horse stopped himself having concluded it was impossible to see his own body he saw tip however and came close to the boy to observe him more fully  it was really comical to see the creature walk for it moved the legs on its right side together and those on its left side together as a pacing horse does and that made its body rock sidewise like a cradle  tip patted it upon the head and said good boy good boy in a coaxing tone and the saw-horse pranced away to examine with its bulging eyes the form of jack pumpkinhead  i must find a halter for him said tip and having made a search in his pocket he produced a roll of strong cord unwinding this he approached the saw-horse and tied the cord around its neck afterward fastening the other end to a large tree the saw-horse not understanding the action stepped backward and snapped the string easily but it made no attempt to run away  he’s stronger than i thought said the boy and rather obstinate too  why don’t you make him some ears asked jack then you can tell him what to do  that’s a splendid idea said tip how did you happen to think of it  why i didn’t think of it answered the pumpkinhead i didn’t need to for it’s the simplest and easiest thing to do  so tip got out his knife and fashioned some ears out of the bark of a small tree  i mustn’t make them too big he said as he whittled or our horse would become a donkey  how is that inquired jack from the roadside  why a horse has bigger ears than a man and a donkey has bigger ears than a horse explained tip  then if my ears were longer would i be a horse asked jack  my friend said tip gravely you’ll never be anything but a pumpkinhead no matter how big your ears are  oh returned jack nodding i think i understand  if you do you’re a wonder remarked the boy but there’s no harm in thinking you understand i guess these ears are ready now will you hold the horse while i stick them on  certainly if you’ll help me up said jack  so tip raised him to his feet and the pumpkinhead went to the horse and held its head while the boy bored two holes in it with his knife-blade and inserted the ears  they make him look very handsome said jack admiringly  but those words spoken close to the saw-horse and being the first sounds he had ever heard so startled the animal that he made a bound forward and tumbled tip on one side and jack on the other then he continued to rush forward as if frightened by the clatter of his own foot-steps  whoa shouted tip picking himself up whoa you idiot whoa the saw-horse would probably have paid no attention to this but just then it stepped a leg into a gopher-hole and stumbled head-over-heels to the ground where it lay upon its back frantically waving its four legs in the air  tip ran up to it  you’re a nice sort of a horse i must say he exclaimed why didn’t you stop when i yelled ‘whoa’  does ‘whoa’ mean to stop asked the saw-horse in a surprised voice as it rolled its eyes upward to look at the boy  of course it does answered tip  and a hole in the ground means to stop also doesn’t it continued the horse  to be sure unless you step over it said tip  what a strange place this is the creature exclaimed as if amazed what am i doing here anyway  why i’ve brought you to life answered the boy but it won’t hurt you any if you mind me and do as i tell you  then i will do as you tell me replied the saw-horse humbly but what happened to me a moment ago i don’t seem to be just right someway  [illustration  image062]  you’re upside down explained tip but just keep those legs still a minute and i’ll set you right side up again  how many sides have i asked the creature wonderingly  several said tip briefly but do keep those legs still  the saw-horse now became quiet and held its legs rigid so that tip after several efforts was able to roll him over and set him upright  ah i seem all right now said the queer animal with a sigh  one of your ears is broken tip announced after a careful examination i’ll have to make a new one  then he led the saw-horse back to where jack was vainly struggling to regain his feet and after assisting the pumpkinhead to stand upright tip whittled out a new ear and fastened it to the horse’s head  now said he addressing his steed pay attention to what i’m going to tell you ‘whoa’ means to stop ‘get-up’ means to walk forward ‘trot’ means to go as fast as you can understand  i believe i do returned the horse  very good we are all going on a journey to the emerald city to see his majesty the scarecrow and jack pumpkinhead is going to ride on your back so he won’t wear out his joints  i don’t mind said the saw-horse anything that suits you suits me  then tip assisted jack to get upon the horse  hold on tight he cautioned or you may fall off and crack your pumpkin head  that would be horrible said jack with a shudder what shall i hold on to  why hold on to his ears replied tip after a moment’s hesitation  don’t do that remonstrated the saw-horse for then i can’t hear  that seemed reasonable so tip tried to think of something else  i’ll fix it said he at length he went into the wood and cut a short length of limb from a young stout tree one end of this he sharpened to a point and then he dug a hole in the back of the saw-horse just behind its head next he brought a piece of rock from the road and hammered the post firmly into the animal’s back  stop stop shouted the horse you’re jarring me terribly  [illustration  image065]  does it hurt asked the boy  not exactly hurt answered the animal but it makes me quite nervous to be jarred  well it’s all over now said tip encouragingly now jack be sure to hold fast to this post and then you can’t fall off and get smashed  so jack held on tight and tip said to the horse   get up  the obedient creature at once walked forward rocking from side to side as he raised his feet from the ground  tip walked beside the saw-horse quite content with this addition to their party presently he began to whistle  what does that sound mean asked the horse  don’t pay any attention to it said tip i’m just whistling and that only means i’m pretty well satisfied  i’d whistle myself if i could push my lips together remarked jack i fear dear father that in some respects i am sadly lacking  [illustration  image067]  after journeying on for some distance the narrow path they were following turned into a broad roadway paved with yellow brick by the side of the road tip noticed a sign-post that read   nine miles to the emerald city  but it was now growing dark so he decided to camp for the night by the roadside and to resume the journey next morning by daybreak he led the saw-horse to a grassy mound upon which grew several bushy trees and carefully assisted the pumpkinhead to alight  i think i’ll lay you upon the ground overnight said the boy you will be safer that way  how about me asked the saw-horse  it won’t hurt you to stand replied tip and as you can’t sleep you may as well watch out and see that no one comes near to disturb us  then the boy stretched himself upon the grass beside the pumpkinhead and being greatly wearied by the journey was soon fast asleep  [illustration  image069]  [illustration  image070]  [illustration  image071]     jack pumpkinhead’s ride to the emerald city   at daybreak tip was awakened by the pumpkinhead he rubbed the sleep from his eyes bathed in a little brook and then ate a portion of his bread and cheese having thus prepared for a new day the boy said   let us start at once nine miles is quite a distance but we ought to reach the emerald city by noon if no accidents happen so the pumpkinhead was again perched upon the back of the saw-horse and the journey was resumed  tip noticed that the purple tint of the grass and trees had now faded to a dull lavender and before long this lavender appeared to take on a greenish tinge that gradually brightened as they drew nearer to the great city where the scarecrow ruled  the little party had traveled but a short two miles upon their way when the road of yellow brick was parted by a broad and swift river tip was puzzled how to cross over but after a time he discovered a man in a ferry-boat approaching from the other side of the stream  when the man reached the bank tip asked   will you row us to the other side  yes if you have money returned the ferryman whose face looked cross and disagreeable  but i have no money said tip  none at all inquired the man  none at all answered the boy  then i’ll not break my back rowing you over said the ferryman decidedly  what a nice man remarked the pumpkinhead smilingly  the ferryman stared at him but made no reply tip was trying to think for it was a great disappointment to him to find his journey so suddenly brought to an end  i must certainly get to the emerald city he said to the boatman but how can i cross the river if you do not take me  the man laughed and it was not a nice laugh  that wooden horse will float said he and you can ride him across as for the pumpkinheaded loon who accompanies you let him sink or swim it won’t matter greatly which  [illustration  image073]  don’t worry about me said jack smiling pleasantly upon the crabbed ferryman i’m sure i ought to float beautifully  tip thought the experiment was worth making and the saw-horse who did not know what danger meant offered no objections whatever so the boy led it down into the water and climbed upon its back jack also waded in up to his knees and grasped the tail of the horse so that he might keep his pumpkin head above the water  now said tip instructing the saw-horse if you wiggle your legs you will probably swim and if you swim we shall probably reach the other side  the saw-horse at once began to wiggle its legs which acted as oars and moved the adventurers slowly across the river to the opposite side so successful was the trip that presently they were climbing wet and dripping up the grassy bank  tip’s trouser-legs and shoes were thoroughly soaked but the saw-horse had floated so perfectly that from his knees up the boy was entirely dry as for the pumpkinhead every stitch of his gorgeous clothing dripped water  the sun will soon dry us said tip and anyhow we are now safely across in spite of the ferryman and can continue our journey  i didn’t mind swimming at all remarked the horse  nor did i added jack  they soon regained the road of yellow brick which proved to be a continuation of the road they had left on the other side and then tip once more mounted the pumpkinhead upon the back of the saw-horse  if you ride fast said he the wind will help to dry your clothing i will hold on to the horse’s tail and run after you in this way we all will become dry in a very short time  then the horse must step lively said jack  i’ll do my best returned the saw-horse cheerfully  tip grasped the end of the branch that served as tail to the saw-horse and called loudly  get-up  the horse started at a good pace and tip followed behind then he decided they could go faster so he shouted  trot  [illustration  image075]  now the saw-horse remembered that this word was the command to go as fast as he could so he began rocking along the road at a tremendous pace and tip had hard work—running faster than he ever had before in his life—to keep his feet  soon he was out of breath and although he wanted to call whoa to the horse he found he could not get the word out of his throat then the end of the tail he was clutching being nothing more than a dead branch suddenly broke away and the next minute the boy was rolling in the dust of the road while the horse and its pumpkin-headed rider dashed on and quickly disappeared in the distance  by the time tip had picked himself up and cleared the dust from his throat so he could say whoa there was no further need of saying it for the horse was long since out of sight  so he did the only sensible thing he could do he sat down and took a good rest and afterward began walking along the road  some time i will surely overtake them he reflected for the road will end at the gates of the emerald city and they can go no further than that  meantime jack was holding fast to the post and the saw-horse was tearing along the road like a racer neither of them knew tip was left behind for the pumpkinhead did not look around and the saw-horse couldn’t  as he rode jack noticed that the grass and trees had become a bright emerald-green in color so he guessed they were nearing the emerald city even before the tall spires and domes came into sight  at length a high wall of green stone studded thick with emeralds loomed up before them and fearing the saw-horse would not know enough to stop and so might smash them both against this wall jack ventured to cry whoa as loud as he could  so suddenly did the horse obey that had it not been for his post jack would have been pitched off head foremost and his beautiful face ruined  that was a fast ride dear father he exclaimed and then hearing no reply he turned around and discovered for the first time that tip was not there  this apparent desertion puzzled the pumpkinhead and made him uneasy and while he was wondering what had become of the boy and what he ought to do next under such trying circumstances the gateway in the green wall opened and a man came out  this man was short and round with a fat face that seemed remarkably good-natured he was clothed all in green and wore a high peaked green hat upon his head and green spectacles over his eyes bowing before the pumpkinhead he said   i am the guardian of the gates of the emerald city may i inquire who you are and what is your business  my name is jack pumpkinhead returned the other smilingly but as to my business i haven’t the least idea in the world what it is  the guardian of the gates looked surprised and shook his head as if dissatisfied with the reply  what are you a man or a pumpkin he asked politely  both if you please answered jack  and this wooden horse—is it alive questioned the guardian  the horse rolled one knotty eye upward and winked at jack then it gave a prance and brought one leg down on the guardian’s toes  ouch cried the man i’m sorry i asked that question but the answer is most convincing have you any errand sir in the emerald city  it seems to me that i have replied the pumpkinhead seriously but i cannot think what it is my father knows all about it but he is not here  this is a strange affair very strange declared the guardian but you seem harmless folks do not smile so delightfully when they mean mischief  as for that said jack i cannot help my smile for it is carved on my face with a jack-knife  well come with me into my room resumed the guardian and i will see what can be done for you  so jack rode the saw-horse through the gateway into a little room built into the wall the guardian pulled a bell-cord and presently a very tall soldier—clothed in a green uniform—entered from the opposite door this soldier carried a long green gun over his shoulder and had lovely green whiskers that fell quite to his knees the guardian at once addressed him saying   here is a strange gentleman who doesn’t know why he has come to the emerald city or what he wants tell me what shall we do with him  the soldier with the green whiskers looked at jack with much care and curiosity finally he shook his head so positively that little waves rippled down his whiskers and then he said   i must take him to his majesty the scarecrow  but what will his majesty the scarecrow do with him asked the guardian of the gates  that is his majesty’s business returned the soldier i have troubles enough of my own all outside troubles must be turned over to his majesty so put the spectacles on this fellow and i’ll take him to the royal palace  so the guardian opened a big box of spectacles and tried to fit a pair to jack’s great round eyes  i haven’t a pair in stock that will really cover those eyes up said the little man with a sigh and your head is so big that i shall be obliged to tie the spectacles on  but why need i wear spectacles asked jack  [illustration  image081]  it’s the fashion here said the soldier and they will keep you from being blinded by the glitter and glare of the gorgeous emerald city  oh exclaimed jack tie them on by all means i don’t wish to be blinded  nor i broke in the saw-horse so a pair of green spectacles was quickly fastened over the bulging knots that served it for eyes  then the soldier with the green whiskers led them through the inner gate and they at once found themselves in the main street of the magnificent emerald city  sparkling green gems ornamented the fronts of the beautiful houses and the towers and turrets were all faced with emeralds even the green marble pavement glittered with precious stones and it was indeed a grand and marvelous sight to one who beheld it for the first time  however the pumpkinhead and the saw-horse knowing nothing of wealth and beauty paid little attention to the wonderful sights they saw through their green spectacles they calmly followed after the green soldier and scarcely noticed the crowds of green people who stared at them in surprise when a green dog ran out and barked at them the saw-horse promptly kicked at it with its wooden leg and sent the little animal howling into one of the houses but nothing more serious than this happened to interrupt their progress to the royal palace  the pumpkinhead wanted to ride up the green marble steps and straight into the scarecrow’s presence but the soldier would not permit that so jack dismounted with much difficulty and a servant led the saw-horse around to the rear while the soldier with the green whiskers escorted the pumpkinhead into the palace by the front entrance  the stranger was left in a handsomely furnished waiting room while the soldier went to announce him it so happened that at this hour his majesty was at leisure and greatly bored for want of something to do so he ordered his visitor to be shown at once into his throne room  jack felt no fear or embarrassment at meeting the ruler of this magnificent city for he was entirely ignorant of all worldly customs but when he entered the room and saw for the first time his majesty the scarecrow seated upon his glittering throne he stopped short in amazement  [illustration  image084]  [illustration  image085]     his majesty the scarecrow   i suppose every reader of this book knows what a scarecrow is but jack pumpkinhead never having seen such a creation was more surprised at meeting the remarkable king of the emerald city than by any other one experience of his brief life  his majesty the scarecrow was dressed in a suit of faded blue clothes and his head was merely a small sack stuffed with straw upon which eyes ears a nose and a mouth had been rudely painted to represent a face the clothes were also stuffed with straw and that so unevenly or carelessly that his majesty’s legs and arms seemed more bumpy than was necessary upon his hands were gloves with long fingers and these were padded with cotton wisps of straw stuck out from the monarch’s coat and also from his neck and boot-tops upon his head he wore a heavy golden crown set thick with sparkling jewels and the weight of this crown caused his brow to sag in wrinkles giving a thoughtful expression to the painted face indeed the crown alone betokened majesty in all else the scarecrow king was but a simple scarecrow—flimsy awkward and unsubstantial  but if the strange appearance of his majesty the scarecrow seemed startling to jack no less wonderful was the form of the pumpkinhead to the scarecrow the purple trousers and pink waistcoat and red shirt hung loosely over the wooden joints tip had manufactured and the carved face on the pumpkin grinned perpetually as if its wearer considered life the jolliest thing imaginable  at first indeed his majesty thought his queer visitor was laughing at him and was inclined to resent such a liberty but it was not without reason that the scarecrow had attained the reputation of being the wisest personage in the land of oz he made a more careful examination of his visitor and soon discovered that jack’s features were carved into a smile and that he could not look grave if he wished to  [illustration  image087]  the king was the first to speak after regarding jack for some minutes he said in a tone of wonder   where on earth did you come from and how do you happen to be alive  i beg your majesty’s pardon returned the pumpkinhead but i do not understand you  what don’t you understand asked the scarecrow  why i don’t understand your language you see i came from the country of the gillikins so that i am a foreigner  ah to be sure exclaimed the scarecrow i myself speak the language of the munchkins which is also the language of the emerald city but you i suppose speak the language of the pumpkinheads  exactly so your majesty replied the other bowing so it will be impossible for us to understand one another  that is unfortunate certainly said the scarecrow thoughtfully we must have an interpreter  what is an interpreter asked jack  a person who understands both my language and your own when i say anything the interpreter can tell you what i mean and when you say anything the interpreter can tell me what you mean for the interpreter can speak both languages as well as understand them  that is certainly clever said jack greatly pleased at finding so simple a way out of the difficulty  so the scarecrow commanded the soldier with the green whiskers to search among his people until he found one who understood the language of the gillikins as well as the language of the emerald city and to bring that person to him at once  when the soldier had departed the scarecrow said   won’t you take a chair while we are waiting  [illustration  image090]  your majesty forgets that i cannot understand you replied the pumpkinhead if you wish me to sit down you must make a sign for me to do so the scarecrow came down from his throne and rolled an armchair to a position behind the pumpkinhead then he gave jack a sudden push that sent him sprawling upon the cushions in so awkward a fashion that he doubled up like a jackknife and had hard work to untangle himself  did you understand that sign asked his majesty politely  perfectly declared jack reaching up his arms to turn his head to the front the pumpkin having twisted around upon the stick that supported it  you seem hastily made remarked the scarecrow watching jack’s efforts to straighten himself  not more so than your majesty was the frank reply  there is this difference between us said the scarecrow that whereas i will bend but not break you will break but not bend  at this moment the soldier returned leading a young girl by the hand she seemed very sweet and modest having a pretty face and beautiful green eyes and hair a dainty green silk skirt reached to her knees showing silk stockings embroidered with pea-pods and green satin slippers with bunches of lettuce for decorations instead of bows or buckles upon her silken waist clover leaves were embroidered and she wore a jaunty little jacket trimmed with sparkling emeralds of a uniform size  why it’s little jellia jamb exclaimed the scarecrow as the green maiden bowed her pretty head before him do you understand the language of the gillikins my dear  yes your majesty she answered for i was born in the north country  then you shall be our interpreter said the scarecrow and explain to this pumpkinhead all that i say and also explain to me all that he says is this arrangement satisfactory he asked turning toward his guest  very satisfactory indeed was the reply  then ask him to begin with resumed the scarecrow turning to jellia what brought him to the emerald city  but instead of this the girl who had been staring at jack said to him   you are certainly a wonderful creature who made you  a boy named tip answered jack  what does he say inquired the scarecrow my ears must have deceived me what did he say  he says that your majesty’s brains seem to have come loose replied the girl demurely  the scarecrow moved uneasily upon his throne and felt of his head with his left hand  what a fine thing it is to understand two different languages he said with a perplexed sigh ask him my dear if he has any objection to being put in jail for insulting the ruler of the emerald city  i didn’t insult you protested jack indignantly  tut—tut cautioned the scarecrow wait until jellia translates my speech what have we got an interpreter for if you break out in this rash way  all right i’ll wait replied the pumpkinhead in a surly tone—although his face smiled as genially as ever translate the speech young woman  his majesty inquires if you are hungry said jellia  oh not at all answered jack more pleasantly for it is impossible for me to eat  it’s the same way with me remarked the scarecrow what did he say jellia my dear  he asked if you were aware that one of your eyes is painted larger than the other said the girl mischievously  [illustration  image093]  don’t you believe her your majesty cried jack  oh i don’t answered the scarecrow calmly then casting a sharp look at the girl he asked   are you quite certain you understand the languages of both the gillikins and the munchkins  quite certain your majesty said jellia jamb trying hard not to laugh in the face of royalty  then how is it that i seem to understand them myself inquired the scarecrow  because they are one and the same declared the girl now laughing merrily does not your majesty know that in all the land of oz but one language is spoken  is it indeed so cried the scarecrow much relieved to hear this then i might easily have been my own interpreter  it was all my fault your majesty said jack looking rather foolish i thought we must surely speak different languages since we came from different countries  this should be a warning to you never to think returned the scarecrow severely for unless one can think wisely it is better to remain a dummy—which you most certainly are  i am—i surely am agreed the pumpkinhead  it seems to me continued the scarecrow more mildly that your manufacturer spoiled some good pies to create an indifferent man  i assure your majesty that i did not ask to be created answered jack  ah it was the same in my case said the king pleasantly and so as we differ from all ordinary people let us become friends  with all my heart exclaimed jack  what have you a heart asked the scarecrow surprised  no that was only imaginative—i might say a figure of speech said the other  well your most prominent figure seems to be a figure of wood so i must beg you to restrain an imagination which having no brains you have no right to exercise suggested the scarecrow warningly  to be sure said jack without in the least comprehending  his majesty then dismissed jellia jamb and the soldier with the green whiskers and when they were gone he took his new friend by the arm and led him into the courtyard to play a game of quoits  [illustration  image097]  [illustration  image098]  [illustration  image099]     gen jinjur’s army of revolt   tip was so anxious to rejoin his man jack and the saw-horse that he walked a full half the distance to the emerald city without stopping to rest then he discovered that he was hungry and the crackers and cheese he had provided for the journey had all been eaten  while wondering what he should do in this emergency he came upon a girl sitting by the roadside she wore a costume that struck the boy as being remarkably brilliant  her silken waist being of emerald green and her skirt of four distinct colors—blue in front yellow at the left side red at the back and purple at the right side fastening the waist in front were four buttons—the top one blue the next yellow a third red and the last purple  [illustration  image100]  the splendor of this dress was almost barbaric so tip was fully justified in staring at the gown for some moments before his eyes were attracted by the pretty face above it yes the face was pretty enough he decided but it wore an expression of discontent coupled to a shade of defiance or audacity  while the boy stared the girl looked upon him calmly a lunch basket stood beside her and she held a dainty sandwich in one hand and a hard-boiled egg in the other eating with an evident appetite that aroused tip’s sympathy  he was just about to ask a share of the luncheon when the girl stood up and brushed the crumbs from her lap  there said she it is time for me to go carry that basket for me and help yourself to its contents if you are hungry  tip seized the basket eagerly and began to eat following for a time the strange girl without bothering to ask questions she walked along before him with swift strides and there was about her an air of decision and importance that led him to suspect she was some great personage  finally when he had satisfied his hunger he ran up beside her and tried to keep pace with her swift footsteps—a very difficult feat for she was much taller than he and evidently in a hurry  thank you very much for the sandwiches said tip as he trotted along may i ask your name  i am general jinjur was the brief reply  oh said the boy surprised what sort of a general  i command the army of revolt in this war answered the general with unnecessary sharpness  oh he again exclaimed i didn’t know there was a war  you were not supposed to know it she returned for we have kept it a secret and considering that our army is composed entirely of girls she added with some pride it is surely a remarkable thing that our revolt is not yet discovered  it is indeed acknowledged tip but where is your army  about a mile from here said general jinjur the forces have assembled from all parts of the land of oz at my express command for this is the day we are to conquer his majesty the scarecrow and wrest from him the throne the army of revolt only awaits my coming to march upon the emerald city  well declared tip drawing a long breath this is certainly a surprising thing may i ask why you wish to conquer his majesty the scarecrow  because the emerald city has been ruled by men long enough for one reason said the girl  moreover the city glitters with beautiful gems which might far better be used for rings bracelets and necklaces and there is enough money in the king’s treasury to buy every girl in our army a dozen new gowns so we intend to conquer the city and run the government to suit ourselves  jinjur spoke these words with an eagerness and decision that proved she was in earnest  but war is a terrible thing said tip thoughtfully  this war will be pleasant replied the girl cheerfully  many of you will be slain continued the boy in an awed voice  oh no said jinjur what man would oppose a girl or dare to harm her and there is not an ugly face in my entire army  tip laughed  perhaps you are right said he but the guardian of the gate is considered a faithful guardian and the king’s army will not let the city be conquered without a struggle  the army is old and feeble replied general jinjur scornfully his strength has all been used to grow whiskers and his wife has such a temper that she has already pulled more than half of them out by the roots when the wonderful wizard reigned the soldier with the green whiskers was a very good royal army for people feared the wizard but no one is afraid of the scarecrow so his royal army don’t count for much in time of war  after this conversation they proceeded some distance in silence and before long reached a large clearing in the forest where fully four hundred young women were assembled these were laughing and talking together as gaily as if they had gathered for a picnic instead of a war of conquest  they were divided into four companies and tip noticed that all were dressed in costumes similar to that worn by general jinjur the only real difference was that while those girls from the munchkin country had the blue strip in front of their skirts those from the country of the quadlings had the red strip in front and those from the country of the winkies had the yellow strip in front and the gillikin girls wore the purple strip in front all had green waists representing the emerald city they intended to conquer and the top button on each waist indicated by its color which country the wearer came from the uniforms were jaunty and becoming and quite effective when massed together  tip thought this strange army bore no weapons whatever but in this he was wrong for each girl had stuck through the knot of her back hair two long glittering knitting-needles  general jinjur immediately mounted the stump of a tree and addressed her army  friends fellow-citizens and girls she said we are about to begin our great revolt against the men of oz we march to conquer the emerald city—to dethrone the scarecrow king—to acquire thousands of gorgeous gems—to rifle the royal treasury—and to obtain power over our former oppressors  [illustration  image105]  [illustration  image106]  hurrah said those who had listened but tip thought most of the army was too much engaged in chattering to pay attention to the words of the general  the command to march was now given and the girls formed themselves into four bands or companies and set off with eager strides toward the emerald city  [illustration  image107]  the boy followed after them carrying several baskets and wraps and packages which various members of the army of revolt had placed in his care it was not long before they came to the green granite walls of the city and halted before the gateway  the guardian of the gate at once came out and looked at them curiously as if a circus had come to town he carried a bunch of keys swung round his neck by a golden chain his hands were thrust carelessly into his pockets and he seemed to have no idea at all that the city was threatened by rebels speaking pleasantly to the girls he said   good morning my dears what can i do for you  surrender instantly answered general jinjur standing before him and frowning as terribly as her pretty face would allow her to  surrender echoed the man astounded why it’s impossible it’s against the law i never heard of such a thing in my life  still you must surrender exclaimed the general fiercely we are revolting  you don’t look it said the guardian gazing from one to another admiringly  but we are cried jinjur stamping her foot impatiently and we mean to conquer the emerald city  good gracious returned the surprised guardian of the gates what a nonsensical idea go home to your mothers my good girls and milk the cows and bake the bread don’t you know it’s a dangerous thing to conquer a city  [illustration  image109]  we are not afraid responded the general and she looked so determined that it made the guardian uneasy  so he rang the bell for the soldier with the green whiskers and the next minute was sorry he had done so for immediately he was surrounded by a crowd of girls who drew the knitting-needles from their hair and began jabbing them at the guardian with the sharp points dangerously near his fat cheeks and blinking eyes  the poor man howled loudly for mercy and made no resistance when jinjur drew the bunch of keys from around his neck  followed by her army the general now rushed to the gateway where she was confronted by the royal army of oz—which was the other name for the soldier with the green whiskers  halt he cried and pointed his long gun full in the face of the leader  some of the girls screamed and ran back but general jinjur bravely stood her ground and said reproachfully   why how now would you shoot a poor defenceless girl  no replied the soldier for my gun isn’t loaded  not loaded  no for fear of accidents and i’ve forgotten where i hid the powder and shot to load it with but if you’ll wait a short time i’ll try to hunt them up  don’t trouble yourself said jinjur cheerfully then she turned to her army and cried   girls the gun isn’t loaded  hooray shrieked the rebels delighted at this good news and they proceeded to rush upon the soldier with the green whiskers in such a crowd that it was a wonder they didn’t stick the knitting-needles into one another  but the royal army of oz was too much afraid of women to meet the onslaught he simply turned about and ran with all his might through the gate and toward the royal palace while general jinjur and her mob flocked into the unprotected city  in this way was the emerald city captured without a drop of blood being spilled the army of revolt had become an army of conquerors  [illustration  image111]  [illustration  image112]  [illustration  image113]     the scarecrow plans an escape   tip slipped away from the girls and followed swiftly after the soldier with the green whiskers the invading army entered the city more slowly for they stopped to dig emeralds out of the walls and paving-stones with the points of their knitting-needles so the soldier and the boy reached the palace before the news had spread that the city was conquered  the scarecrow and jack pumpkinhead were still playing at quoits in the courtyard when the game was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of the royal army of oz who came flying in without his hat or gun his clothes in sad disarray and his long beard floating a yard behind him as he ran  tally one for me said the scarecrow calmly what’s wrong my man he added addressing the soldier  oh your majesty—your majesty the city is conquered gasped the royal army who was all out of breath  this is quite sudden said the scarecrow but please go and bar all the doors and windows of the palace while i show this pumpkinhead how to throw a quoit  the soldier hastened to do this while tip who had arrived at his heels remained in the courtyard to look at the scarecrow with wondering eyes  his majesty continued to throw the quoits as coolly as if no danger threatened his throne but the pumpkinhead having caught sight of tip ambled toward the boy as fast as his wooden legs would go  good afternoon noble parent he cried delightedly i’m glad to see you are here that terrible saw-horse ran away with me  i suspected it said tip did you get hurt are you cracked at all  no i arrived safely answered jack and his majesty has been very kind indeed to me  at this moment the soldier with the green whiskers returned and the scarecrow asked   by the way who has conquered me  a regiment of girls gathered from the four corners of the land of oz replied the soldier still pale with fear  but where was my standing army at the time inquired his majesty looking at the soldier gravely  your standing army was running answered the fellow honestly for no man could face the terrible weapons of the invaders  well said the scarecrow after a moment’s thought i don’t mind much the loss of my throne for it’s a tiresome job to rule over the emerald city and this crown is so heavy that it makes my head ache but i hope the conquerors have no intention of injuring me just because i happen to be the king  i heard them say remarked tip with some hesitation that they intend to make a rag carpet of your outside and stuff their sofa-cushions with your inside  then i am really in danger declared his majesty positively and it will be wise for me to consider a means to escape  [illustration  image116]  where can you go asked jack pumpkinhead  why to my friend the tin woodman who rules over the winkies and calls himself their emperor was the answer i am sure he will protect me  tip was looking out the window  the palace is surrounded by the enemy said he it is too late to escape they would soon tear you to pieces  the scarecrow sighed  in an emergency he announced it is always a good thing to pause and reflect please excuse me while i pause and reflect  but we also are in danger said the pumpkinhead anxiously if any of these girls understand cooking my end is not far off  nonsense exclaimed the scarecrow they’re too busy to cook even if they know how  but should i remain here a prisoner for any length of time protested jack i’m liable to spoil  ah then you would not be fit to associate with returned the scarecrow the matter is more serious than i suspected  you said the pumpkinhead gloomily are liable to live for many years my life is necessarily short so i must take advantage of the few days that remain to me  there there don’t worry answered the scarecrow soothingly if you’ll keep quiet long enough for me to think i’ll try to find some way for us all to escape  so the others waited in patient silence while the scarecrow walked to a corner and stood with his face to the wall for a good five minutes at the end of that time he faced them with a more cheerful expression upon his painted face  where is the saw-horse you rode here he asked the pumpkinhead  why i said he was a jewel and so your man locked him up in the royal treasury said jack  it was the only place i could think of your majesty added the soldier fearing he had made a blunder  it pleases me very much said the scarecrow has the animal been fed  oh yes i gave him a heaping peck of sawdust  excellent cried the scarecrow bring the horse here at once  the soldier hastened away and presently they heard the clattering of the horse’s wooden legs upon the pavement as he was led into the courtyard  his majesty regarded the steed critically he doesn’t seem especially graceful he remarked musingly but i suppose he can run  he can indeed said tip gazing upon the saw-horse admiringly  then bearing us upon his back he must make a dash through the ranks of the rebels and carry us to my friend the tin woodman announced the scarecrow  he can’t carry four objected tip  no but he may be induced to carry three said his majesty i shall therefore leave my royal army behind for from the ease with which he was conquered i have little confidence in his powers  still he can run declared tip laughing  i expected this blow said the soldier sulkily but i can bear it i shall disguise myself by cutting off my lovely green whiskers and after all it is no more dangerous to face those reckless girls than to ride this fiery untamed wooden horse  perhaps you are right observed his majesty but for my part not being a soldier i am fond of danger now my boy you must mount first and please sit as close to the horse’s neck as possible  tip climbed quickly to his place and the soldier and the scarecrow managed to hoist the pumpkinhead to a seat just behind him there remained so little space for the king that he was liable to fall off as soon as the horse started  fetch a clothesline said the king to his army and tie us all together then if one falls off we will all fall off  and while the soldier was gone for the clothesline his majesty continued it is well for me to be careful for my very existence is in danger  i have to be as careful as you do said jack  not exactly replied the scarecrow for if anything happened to me that would be the end of me but if anything happened to you they could use you for seed  the soldier now returned with a long line and tied all three firmly together also lashing them to the body of the saw-horse so there seemed little danger of their tumbling off  now throw open the gates commanded the scarecrow and we will make a dash to liberty or to death  [illustration  image121]  the courtyard in which they were standing was located in the center of the great palace which surrounded it on all sides but in one place a passage led to an outer gateway which the soldier had barred by order of his sovereign it was through this gateway his majesty proposed to escape and the royal army now led the saw-horse along the passage and unbarred the gate which swung backward with a loud crash  now said tip to the horse you must save us all run as fast as you can for the gate of the city and don’t let anything stop you  all right answered the saw-horse gruffly and dashed away so suddenly that tip had to gasp for breath and hold firmly to the post he had driven into the creature’s neck  several of the girls who stood outside guarding the palace were knocked over by the saw-horse’s mad rush others ran screaming out of the way and only one or two jabbed their knitting-needles frantically at the escaping prisoners tip got one small prick in his left arm which smarted for an hour afterward but the needles had no effect upon the scarecrow or jack pumpkinhead who never even suspected they were being prodded  as for the saw-horse he made a wonderful record upsetting a fruit cart overturning several meek looking men and finally bowling over the new guardian of the gate—a fussy little fat woman appointed by general jinjur  nor did the impetuous charger stop then once outside the walls of the emerald city he dashed along the road to the west with fast and violent leaps that shook the breath out of the boy and filled the scarecrow with wonder  jack had ridden at this mad rate once before so he devoted every effort to holding with both hands his pumpkin head upon its stick enduring meantime the dreadful jolting with the courage of a philosopher  slow him up slow him up shouted the scarecrow my straw is all shaking down into my legs  but tip had no breath to speak so the saw-horse continued his wild career unchecked and with unabated speed  presently they came to the banks of a wide river and without a pause the wooden steed gave one final leap and launched them all in mid-air  a second later they were rolling splashing and bobbing about in the water the horse struggling frantically to find a rest for its feet and its riders being first plunged beneath the rapid current and then floating upon the surface like corks  [illustration  image123]  [illustration  image124]  [illustration  image125]     the journey to the tin woodman   tip was well soaked and dripping water from every angle of his body but he managed to lean forward and shout in the ear of the saw-horse   keep still you fool keep still  the horse at once ceased struggling and floated calmly upon the surface its wooden body being as buoyant as a raft  what does that word ‘fool’ mean enquired the horse  it is a term of reproach answered tip somewhat ashamed of the expression i only use it when i am angry  then it pleases me to be able to call you a fool in return said the horse for i did not make the river nor put it in our way so only a term of reproach is fit for one who becomes angry with me for falling into the water  that is quite evident replied tip so i will acknowledge myself in the wrong then he called out to the pumpkinhead  are you all right jack  there was no reply so the boy called to the king are you all right your majesty  the scarecrow groaned  i’m all wrong somehow he said in a weak voice how very wet this water is  tip was bound so tightly by the cord that he could not turn his head to look at his companions so he said to the saw-horse   paddle with your legs toward the shore  the horse obeyed and although their progress was slow they finally reached the opposite river bank at a place where it was low enough to enable the creature to scramble upon dry land  with some difficulty the boy managed to get his knife out of his pocket and cut the cords that bound the riders to one another and to the wooden horse he heard the scarecrow fall to the ground with a mushy sound and then he himself quickly dismounted and looked at his friend jack  the wooden body with its gorgeous clothing still sat upright upon the horse’s back but the pumpkin head was gone and only the sharpened stick that served for a neck was visible as for the scarecrow the straw in his body had shaken down with the jolting and packed itself into his legs and the lower part of his body—which appeared very plump and round while his upper half seemed like an empty sack upon his head the scarecrow still wore the heavy crown which had been sewed on to prevent his losing it but the head was now so damp and limp that the weight of the gold and jewels sagged forward and crushed the painted face into a mass of wrinkles that made him look exactly like a japanese pug dog  tip would have laughed—had he not been so anxious about his man jack but the scarecrow however damaged was all there while the pumpkin head that was so necessary to jack’s existence was missing so the boy seized a long pole that fortunately lay near at hand and anxiously turned again toward the river  [illustration  image128]  far out upon the waters he sighted the golden hue of the pumpkin which gently bobbed up and down with the motion of the waves at that moment it was quite out of tip’s reach but after a time it floated nearer and still nearer until the boy was able to reach it with his pole and draw it to the shore then he brought it to the top of the bank carefully wiped the water from its pumpkin face with his handkerchief and ran with it to jack and replaced the head upon the man’s neck  dear me were jack’s first words what a dreadful experience i wonder if water is liable to spoil pumpkins  tip did not think a reply was necessary for he knew that the scarecrow also stood in need of his help so he carefully removed the straw from the king’s body and legs and spread it out in the sun to dry the wet clothing he hung over the body of the saw-horse  if water spoils pumpkins observed jack with a deep sigh then my days are numbered  i’ve never noticed that water spoils pumpkins returned tip unless the water happens to be boiling if your head isn’t cracked my friend you must be in fairly good condition  oh my head isn’t cracked in the least declared jack more cheerfully  then don’t worry retorted the boy care once killed a cat  then said jack seriously i am very glad indeed that i am not a cat  the sun was fast drying their clothing and tip stirred up his majesty’s straw so that the warm rays might absorb the moisture and make it as crisp and dry as ever when this had been accomplished he stuffed the scarecrow into symmetrical shape and smoothed out his face so that he wore his usual gay and charming expression  thank you very much said the monarch brightly as he walked about and found himself to be well balanced there are several distinct advantages in being a scarecrow for if one has friends near at hand to repair damages nothing very serious can happen to you  i wonder if hot sunshine is liable to crack pumpkins said jack with an anxious ring in his voice  not at all—not at all replied the scarecrow gaily all you need fear my boy is old age when your golden youth has decayed we shall quickly part company—but you needn’t look forward to it we’ll discover the fact ourselves and notify you but come let us resume our journey i am anxious to greet my friend the tin woodman  so they remounted the saw-horse tip holding to the post the pumpkinhead clinging to tip and the scarecrow with both arms around the wooden form of jack  [illustration  image131]  go slowly for now there is no danger of pursuit said tip to his steed  all right responded the creature in a voice rather gruff  aren’t you a little hoarse asked the pumpkinhead politely  the saw-horse gave an angry prance and rolled one knotty eye backward toward tip  see here he growled can’t you protect me from insult  to be sure answered tip soothingly i am sure jack meant no harm and it will not do for us to quarrel you know we must all remain good friends  i’ll have nothing more to do with that pumpkinhead declared the saw-horse viciously he loses his head too easily to suit me  there seemed no fitting reply to this speech so for a time they rode along in silence  after a while the scarecrow remarked   this reminds me of old times it was upon this grassy knoll that i once saved dorothy from the stinging bees of the wicked witch of the west  do stinging bees injure pumpkins asked jack glancing around fearfully  they are all dead so it doesn’t matter replied the scarecrow and here is where nick chopper destroyed the wicked witch’s grey wolves  who was nick chopper asked tip  that is the name of my friend the tin woodman answered his majesty and here is where the winged monkeys captured and bound us and flew away with little dorothy he continued after they had traveled a little way farther  do winged monkeys ever eat pumpkins asked jack with a shiver of fear  i do not know but you have little cause to worry for the winged monkeys are now the slaves of glinda the good who owns the golden cap that commands their services said the scarecrow reflectively  then the stuffed monarch became lost in thought recalling the days of past adventures and the saw-horse rocked and rolled over the flower-strewn fields and carried its riders swiftly upon their way  twilight fell bye and bye and then the dark shadows of night so tip stopped the horse and they all proceeded to dismount  i’m tired out said the boy yawning wearily and the grass is soft and cool let us lie down here and sleep until morning  i can’t sleep said jack  i never do said the scarecrow  i do not even know what sleep is said the saw-horse  still we must have consideration for this poor boy who is made of flesh and blood and bone and gets tired suggested the scarecrow in his usual thoughtful manner i remember it was the same way with little dorothy we always had to sit through the night while she slept  i’m sorry said tip meekly but i can’t help it and i’m dreadfully hungry too  here is a new danger remarked jack gloomily i hope you are not fond of eating pumpkins  not unless they’re stewed and made into pies answered the boy laughing so have no fears of me friend jack  what a coward that pumpkinhead is said the saw-horse scornfully  you might be a coward yourself if you knew you were liable to spoil retorted jack angrily  there—there interrupted the scarecrow don’t let us quarrel we all have our weaknesses dear friends so we must strive to be considerate of one another and since this poor boy is hungry and has nothing whatever to eat let us all remain quiet and allow him to sleep for it is said that in sleep a mortal may forget even hunger  thank you exclaimed tip gratefully your majesty is fully as good as you are wise—and that is saying a good deal  he then stretched himself upon the grass and using the stuffed form of the scarecrow for a pillow was presently fast asleep  [illustration  image135]  [illustration  image136]  [illustration  image137]     a nickel-plated emperor   tip awoke soon after dawn but the scarecrow had already risen and plucked with his clumsy fingers a double-handful of ripe berries from some bushes near by these the boy ate greedily finding them an ample breakfast and afterward the little party resumed its journey  after an hour’s ride they reached the summit of a hill from whence they espied the city of the winkies and noted the tall domes of the emperor’s palace rising from the clusters of more modest dwellings  the scarecrow became greatly animated at this sight and exclaimed   how delighted i shall be to see my old friend the tin woodman again i hope that he rules his people more successfully than i have ruled mine  is the tin woodman the emperor of the winkies asked the horse  yes indeed they invited him to rule over them soon after the wicked witch was destroyed and as nick chopper has the best heart in all the world i am sure he has proved an excellent and able emperor  i thought that ‘emperor’ was the title of a person who rules an empire said tip and the country of the winkies is only a kingdom  don’t mention that to the tin woodman exclaimed the scarecrow earnestly you would hurt his feelings terribly he is a proud man as he has every reason to be and it pleases him to be termed emperor rather than king  i’m sure it makes no difference to me replied the boy  the saw-horse now ambled forward at a pace so fast that its riders had hard work to stick upon its back so there was little further conversation until they drew up beside the palace steps  an aged winkie dressed in a uniform of silver cloth came forward to assist them to alight said the scarecrow to his personage   show us at once to your master the emperor  the man looked from one to another of the party in an embarrassed way and finally answered   i fear i must ask you to wait for a time the emperor is not receiving this morning  how is that enquired the scarecrow anxiously i hope nothing has happened to him  oh no nothing serious returned the man but this is his majesty’s day for being polished and just now his august presence is thickly smeared with putz-pomade  oh i see cried the scarecrow greatly reassured my friend was ever inclined to be a dandy and i suppose he is now more proud than ever of his personal appearance  he is indeed said the man with a polite bow our mighty emperor has lately caused himself to be nickel-plated  good gracious the scarecrow exclaimed at hearing this if his wit bears the same polish how sparkling it must be but show us in—i’m sure the emperor will receive us even in his present state  the emperor’s state is always magnificent said the man but i will venture to tell him of your arrival and will receive his commands concerning you  so the party followed the servant into a splendid ante-room and the saw-horse ambled awkwardly after them having no knowledge that a horse might be expected to remain outside  the travelers were at first somewhat awed by their surroundings and even the scarecrow seemed impressed as he examined the rich hangings of silver cloth caught up into knots and fastened with tiny silver axes upon a handsome center-table stood a large silver oil-can richly engraved with scenes from the past adventures of the tin woodman dorothy the cowardly lion and the scarecrow  the lines of the engraving being traced upon the silver in yellow gold on the walls hung several portraits that of the scarecrow seeming to be the most prominent and carefully executed while a the large painting of the famous wizard of oz in act of presenting the tin woodman with a heart covered almost one entire end of the room  while the visitors gazed at these things in silent admiration they suddenly heard a loud voice in the next room exclaim   well well well what a great surprise  and then the door burst open and nick chopper rushed into their midst and caught the scarecrow in a close and loving embrace that creased him into many folds and wrinkles  [illustration  image141]  my dear old friend my noble comrade cried the tin woodman joyfully how delighted i am to meet you once again  and then he released the scarecrow and held him at arms’ length while he surveyed the beloved painted features  but alas the face of the scarecrow and many portions of his body bore great blotches of putz-pomade for the tin woodman in his eagerness to welcome his friend had quite forgotten the condition of his toilet and had rubbed the thick coating of paste from his own body to that of his comrade  dear me said the scarecrow dolefully what a mess i’m in  never mind my friend returned the tin woodman i’ll send you to my imperial laundry and you’ll come out as good as new  won’t i be mangled asked the scarecrow  no indeed was the reply but tell me how came your majesty here and who are your companions  the scarecrow with great politeness introduced tip and jack pumpkinhead and the latter personage seemed to interest the tin woodman greatly  you are not very substantial i must admit said the emperor but you are certainly unusual and therefore worthy to become a member of our select society  [illustration  image143]  i thank your majesty said jack humbly  i hope you are enjoying good health continued the woodman  at present yes replied the pumpkinhead with a sigh but i am in constant terror of the day when i shall spoil  nonsense said the emperor—but in a kindly sympathetic tone do not i beg of you dampen today’s sun with the showers of tomorrow for before your head has time to spoil you can have it canned and in that way it may be preserved indefinitely  tip during this conversation was looking at the woodman with undisguised amazement and noticed that the celebrated emperor of the winkies was composed entirely of pieces of tin neatly soldered and riveted together into the form of a man he rattled and clanked a little as he moved but in the main he seemed to be most cleverly constructed and his appearance was only marred by the thick coating of polishing-paste that covered him from head to foot  the boy’s intent gaze caused the tin woodman to remember that he was not in the most presentable condition so he begged his friends to excuse him while he retired to his private apartment and allowed his servants to polish him this was accomplished in a short time and when the emperor returned his nickel-plated body shone so magnificently that the scarecrow heartily congratulated him on his improved appearance  that nickel-plate was i confess a happy thought said nick and it was the more necessary because i had become somewhat scratched during my adventurous experiences you will observe this engraved star upon my left breast it not only indicates where my excellent heart lies but covers very neatly the patch made by the wonderful wizard when he placed that valued organ in my breast with his own skillful hands  is your heart then a hand-organ asked the pumpkinhead curiously  by no means responded the emperor with dignity it is i am convinced a strictly orthodox heart although somewhat larger and warmer than most people possess  then he turned to the scarecrow and asked   are your subjects happy and contented my dear friend  i cannot say was the reply for the girls of oz have risen in revolt and driven me out of the emerald city  great goodness cried the tin woodman what a calamity they surely do not complain of your wise and gracious rule  no but they say it is a poor rule that don’t work both ways answered the scarecrow and these females are also of the opinion that men have ruled the land long enough so they have captured my city robbed the treasury of all its jewels and are running things to suit themselves  dear me what an extraordinary idea cried the emperor who was both shocked and surprised  and i heard some of them say said tip that they intend to march here and capture the castle and city of the tin woodman  ah we must not give them time to do that said the emperor quickly we will go at once and recapture the emerald city and place the scarecrow again upon his throne  i was sure you would help me remarked the scarecrow in a pleased voice how large an army can you assemble  we do not need an army replied the woodman we four with the aid of my gleaming axe are enough to strike terror into the hearts of the rebels  we five corrected the pumpkinhead  five repeated the tin woodman  yes the saw-horse is brave and fearless answered jack forgetting his recent quarrel with the quadruped  the tin woodman looked around him in a puzzled way for the saw-horse had until now remained quietly standing in a corner where the emperor had not noticed him tip immediately called the odd-looking creature to them and it approached so awkwardly that it nearly upset the beautiful center-table and the engraved oil-can  i begin to think remarked the tin woodman as he looked earnestly at the saw-horse that wonders will never cease how came this creature alive  i did it with a magic powder modestly asserted the boy and the saw-horse has been very useful to us  he enabled us to escape the rebels added the scarecrow  then we must surely accept him as a comrade declared the emperor a live saw-horse is a distinct novelty and should prove an interesting study does he know anything  well i cannot claim any great experience in life the saw-horse answered for himself but i seem to learn very quickly and often it occurs to me that i know more than any of those around me  perhaps you do said the emperor for experience does not always mean wisdom but time is precious just now so let us quickly make preparations to start upon our journey  [illustration  image146]  the emperor called his lord high chancellor and instructed him how to run the kingdom during his absence meanwhile the scarecrow was taken apart and the painted sack that served him for a head was carefully laundered and restuffed with the brains originally given him by the great wizard his clothes were also cleaned and pressed by the imperial tailors and his crown polished and again sewed upon his head for the tin woodman insisted he should not renounce this badge of royalty the scarecrow now presented a very respectable appearance and although in no way addicted to vanity he was quite pleased with himself and strutted a trifle as he walked while this was being done tip mended the wooden limbs of jack pumpkinhead and made them stronger than before and the saw-horse was also inspected to see if he was in good working order  then bright and early the next morning they set out upon the return journey to the emerald city the tin woodman bearing upon his shoulder a gleaming axe and leading the way while the pumpkinhead rode upon the saw-horse and tip and the scarecrow walked upon either side to make sure that he didn’t fall off or become damaged  [illustration  image149]  [illustration  image150]  [illustration  image152]     mr h m woggle-bug t e   now general jinjur—who you will remember commanded the army of revolt—was rendered very uneasy by the escape of the scarecrow from the emerald city she feared and with good reason that if his majesty and the tin woodman joined forces it would mean danger to her and her entire army for the people of oz had not yet forgotten the deeds of these famous heroes who had passed successfully through so many startling adventures  so jinjur sent post-haste for old mombi the witch and promised her large rewards if she would come to the assistance of the rebel army  mombi was furious at the trick tip had played upon her as well as at his escape and the theft of the precious powder of life so she needed no urging to induce her to travel to the emerald city to assist jinjur in defeating the scarecrow and the tin woodman who had made tip one of their friends  mombi had no sooner arrived at the royal palace than she discovered by means of her secret magic that the adventurers were starting upon their journey to the emerald city so she retired to a small room high up in a tower and locked herself in while she practised such arts as she could command to prevent the return of the scarecrow and his companions  that was why the tin woodman presently stopped and said   something very curious has happened i ought to know by heart and every step of this journey yet i fear we have already lost our way  that is quite impossible protested the scarecrow why do you think my dear friend that we have gone astray  why here before us is a great field of sunflowers—and i never saw this field before in all my life  at these words they all looked around only to find that they were indeed surrounded by a field of tall stalks every stalk bearing at its top a gigantic sunflower and not only were these flowers almost blinding in their vivid hues of red and gold but each one whirled around upon its stalk like a miniature wind-mill completely dazzling the vision of the beholders and so mystifying them that they knew not which way to turn  it’s witchcraft exclaimed tip  while they paused hesitating and wondering the tin woodman uttered a cry of impatience and advanced with swinging axe to cut down the stalks before him but now the sunflowers suddenly stopped their rapid whirling and the travelers plainly saw a girl’s face appear in the center of each flower these lovely faces looked upon the astonished band with mocking smiles and then burst into a chorus of merry laughter at the dismay their appearance caused  stop stop cried tip seizing the woodman’s arm they’re alive they’re girls  at that moment the flowers began whirling again and the faces faded away and were lost in the rapid revolutions  the tin woodman dropped his axe and sat down upon the ground  it would be heartless to chop down those pretty creatures said he despondently and yet i do not know how else we can proceed upon our way  they looked to me strangely like the faces of the army of revolt mused the scarecrow but i cannot conceive how the girls could have followed us here so quickly  i believe it’s magic said tip positively and that someone is playing a trick upon us i’ve known old mombi do things like that before probably it’s nothing more than an illusion and there are no sunflowers here at all  then let us shut our eyes and walk forward suggested the woodman  excuse me replied the scarecrow my eyes are not painted to shut because you happen to have tin eyelids you must not imagine we are all built in the same way  and the eyes of the saw-horse are knot eyes said jack leaning forward to examine them  nevertheless you must ride quickly forward commanded tip and we will follow after you and so try to escape my eyes are already so dazzled that i can scarcely see  so the pumpkinhead rode boldly forward and tip grasped the stub tail of the saw-horse and followed with closed eyes the scarecrow and the tin woodman brought up the rear and before they had gone many yards a joyful shout from jack announced that the way was clear before them  then all paused to look backward but not a trace of the field of sunflowers remained  more cheerfully now they proceeded upon their journey but old mombi had so changed the appearance of the landscape that they would surely have been lost had not the scarecrow wisely concluded to take their direction from the sun for no witch-craft could change the course of the sun and it was therefore a safe guide  however other difficulties lay before them the saw-horse stepped into a rabbit hole and fell to the ground the pumpkinhead was pitched high into the air and his history would probably have ended at that exact moment had not the tin woodman skillfully caught the pumpkin as it descended and saved it from injury  [illustration  image156]  tip soon had it fitted to the neck again and replaced jack upon his feet but the saw-horse did not escape so easily for when his leg was pulled from the rabbit hole it was found to be broken short off and must be replaced or repaired before he could go a step farther  this is quite serious said the tin woodman if there were trees near by i might soon manufacture another leg for this animal but i cannot see even a shrub for miles around  and there are neither fences nor houses in this part of the land of oz added the scarecrow disconsolately  then what shall we do enquired the boy  i suppose i must start my brains working replied his majesty the scarecrow for experience has taught me that i can do anything if i but take time to think it out  let us all think said tip and perhaps we shall find a way to repair the saw-horse  [illustration  image158]  so they sat in a row upon the grass and began to think while the saw-horse occupied itself by gazing curiously upon its broken limb  does it hurt asked the tin woodman in a soft sympathetic voice  not in the least returned the saw-horse but my pride is injured to find that my anatomy is so brittle  for a time the little group remained in silent thought presently the tin woodman raised his head and looked over the fields  what sort of creature is that which approaches us he asked wonderingly  the others followed his gaze and discovered coming toward them the most extraordinary object they had ever beheld it advanced quickly and noiselessly over the soft grass and in a few minutes stood before the adventurers and regarded them with an astonishment equal to their own  [illustration  image159]  the scarecrow was calm under all circumstances  good morning he said politely  the stranger removed his hat with a flourish bowed very low and then responded   good morning one and all i hope you are as an aggregation enjoying excellent health permit me to present my card  with this courteous speech it extended a card toward the scarecrow who accepted it turned it over and over and handed it with a shake of his head to tip  the boy read aloud   mr h m woggle-bug t e  dear me ejaculated the pumpkinhead staring somewhat intently  how very peculiar said the tin woodman  tip’s eyes were round and wondering and the saw-horse uttered a sigh and turned away its head  are you really a woggle-bug enquired the scarecrow  most certainly my dear sir answered the stranger briskly is not my name upon the card  it is said the scarecrow but may i ask what ‘h m’ stands for  ‘h m’ means highly magnified returned the woggle-bug proudly  oh i see the scarecrow viewed the stranger critically and are you in truth highly magnified  sir said the woggle-bug i take you for a gentleman of judgment and discernment does it not occur to you that i am several thousand times greater than any woggle-bug you ever saw before therefore it is plainly evident that i am highly magnified and there is no good reason why you should doubt the fact  pardon me returned the scarecrow my brains are slightly mixed since i was last laundered would it be improper for me to ask also what the ‘te’ at the end of your name stands for  those letters express my degree answered the woggle-bug with a condescending smile to be more explicit the initials mean that i am thoroughly educated  oh said the scarecrow much relieved  tip had not yet taken his eyes off this wonderful personage what he saw was a great round buglike body supported upon two slender legs which ended in delicate feet—the toes curling upward the body of the woggle-bug was rather flat and judging from what could be seen of it was of a glistening dark brown color upon the back while the front was striped with alternate bands of light brown and white blending together at the edges its arms were fully as slender as its legs and upon a rather long neck was perched its head—not unlike the head of a man except that its nose ended in a curling antenna or feeler and its ears from the upper points bore antennae that decorated the sides of its head like two miniature curling pig tails it must be admitted that the round black eyes were rather bulging in appearance but the expression upon the woggle-bug’s face was by no means unpleasant  for dress the insect wore a dark-blue swallowtail coat with a yellow silk lining and a flower in the button-hole a vest of white duck that stretched tightly across the wide body knickerbockers of fawn-colored plush fastened at the knees with gilt buckles and perched upon its small head was jauntily set a tall silk hat  standing upright before our amazed friends the woggle-bug appeared to be fully as tall as the tin woodman and surely no bug in all the land of oz had ever before attained so enormous a size  i confess said the scarecrow that your abrupt appearance has caused me surprise and no doubt has startled my companions i hope however that this circumstance will not distress you we shall probably get used to you in time  do not apologize i beg of you returned the woggle-bug earnestly it affords me great pleasure to surprise people for surely i cannot be classed with ordinary insects and am entitled to both curiosity and admiration from those i meet  you are indeed agreed his majesty  if you will permit me to seat myself in your august company continued the stranger i will gladly relate my history so that you will be better able to comprehend my unusual—may i say remarkable—appearance  you may say what you please answered the tin woodman briefly  so the woggle-bug sat down upon the grass facing the little group of wanderers and told them the following story   [illustration  image164]  [illustration  image165]     a highly magnified history   it is but honest that i should acknowledge at the beginning of my recital that i was born an ordinary woggle-bug began the creature in a frank and friendly tone knowing no better i used my arms as well as my legs for walking and crawled under the edges of stones or hid among the roots of grasses with no thought beyond finding a few insects smaller than myself to feed upon  the chill nights rendered me stiff and motionless for i wore no clothing but each morning the warm rays of the sun gave me new life and restored me to activity a horrible existence is this but you must remember it is the regular ordained existence of woggle-bugs as well as of many other tiny creatures that inhabit the earth  but destiny had singled me out humble though i was for a grander fate one day i crawled near to a country school house and my curiosity being excited by the monotonous hum of the students within i made bold to enter and creep along a crack between two boards until i reached the far end where in front of a hearth of glowing embers sat the master at his desk  no one noticed so small a creature as a woggle-bug and when i found that the hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine i resolved to establish my future home beside it so i found a charming nest between two bricks and hid myself therein for many many months  professor nowitall is doubtless the most famous scholar in the land of oz and after a few days i began to listen to the lectures and discourses he gave his pupils not one of them was more attentive than the humble unnoticed woggle-bug and i acquired in this way a fund of knowledge that i will myself confess is simply marvelous that is why i place ‘te’ thoroughly educated upon my cards for my greatest pride lies in the fact that the world cannot produce another woggle-bug with a tenth part of my own culture and erudition  i do not blame you said the scarecrow education is a thing to be proud of i’m educated myself the mess of brains given me by the great wizard is considered by my friends to be unexcelled  nevertheless interrupted the tin woodman a good heart is i believe much more desirable than education or brains  to me said the saw-horse a good leg is more desirable than either  could seeds be considered in the light of brains enquired the pumpkinhead abruptly  keep quiet commanded tip sternly  very well dear father answered the obedient jack  the woggle-bug listened patiently—even respectfully—to these remarks and then resumed his story  i must have lived fully three years in that secluded school-house hearth said he drinking thirstily of the ever-flowing fount of limpid knowledge before me  quite poetical commented the scarecrow nodding his head approvingly  but one day continued the bug a marvelous circumstance occurred that altered my very existence and brought me to my present pinnacle of greatness the professor discovered me in the act of crawling across the hearth and before i could escape he had caught me between his thumb and forefinger  [illustration  image167]  ‘my dear children’ said he ‘i have captured a woggle-bug—a very rare and interesting specimen do any of you know what a woggle-bug is’  ‘no’ yelled the scholars in chorus  ‘then’ said the professor ‘i will get out my famous magnifying-glass and throw the insect upon a screen in a highly-magnified condition that you may all study carefully its peculiar construction and become acquainted with its habits and manner of life’  he then brought from a cupboard a most curious instrument and before i could realize what had happened i found myself thrown upon a screen in a highly-magnified state—even as you now behold me  [illustration  image169]  the students stood up on their stools and craned their heads forward to get a better view of me and two little girls jumped upon the sill of an open window where they could see more plainly  ‘behold’ cried the professor in a loud voice ‘this highly-magnified woggle-bug one of the most curious insects in existence’  being thoroughly educated and knowing what is required of a cultured gentleman at this juncture i stood upright and placing my hand upon my bosom made a very polite bow my action being unexpected must have startled them for one of the little girls perched upon the window-sill gave a scream and fell backward out the window drawing her companion with her as she disappeared  the professor uttered a cry of horror and rushed away through the door to see if the poor children were injured by the fall the scholars followed after him in a wild mob and i was left alone in the school-room still in a highly-magnified state and free to do as i pleased  it immediately occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to escape i was proud of my great size and realized that now i could safely travel anywhere in the world while my superior culture would make me a fit associate for the most learned person i might chance to meet  so while the professor picked the little girls—who were more frightened than hurt—off the ground and the pupils clustered around him closely grouped i calmly walked out of the school-house turned a corner and escaped unnoticed to a grove of trees that stood near  wonderful exclaimed the pumpkinhead admiringly  it was indeed agreed the woggle-bug i have never ceased to congratulate myself for escaping while i was highly magnified for even my excessive knowledge would have proved of little use to me had i remained a tiny insignificant insect  [illustration  image171]  i didn’t know before said tip looking at the woggle-bug with a puzzled expression that insects wore clothes  nor do they in their natural state returned the stranger but in the course of my wanderings i had the good fortune to save the ninth life of a tailor—tailors having like cats nine lives as you probably know the fellow was exceedingly grateful for had he lost that ninth life it would have been the end of him so he begged permission to furnish me with the stylish costume i now wear it fits very nicely does it not and the woggle-bug stood up and turned himself around slowly that all might examine his person  he must have been a good tailor said the scarecrow somewhat enviously  he was a good-hearted tailor at any rate observed nick chopper  but where were you going when you met us tip asked the woggle-bug  nowhere in particular was the reply although it is my intention soon to visit the emerald city and arrange to give a course of lectures to select audiences on the ‘advantages of magnification’  we are bound for the emerald city now said the tin woodman so if it pleases you to do so you are welcome to travel in our company  the woggle-bug bowed with profound grace  it will give me great pleasure said he to accept your kind invitation for nowhere in the land of oz could i hope to meet with so congenial a company  that is true acknowledged the pumpkinhead we are quite as congenial as flies and honey  but—pardon me if i seem inquisitive—are you not all rather—ahem rather unusual asked the woggle-bug looking from one to another with unconcealed interest  not more so than yourself answered the scarecrow everything in life is unusual until you get accustomed to it  what rare philosophy exclaimed the woggle-bug admiringly  yes my brains are working well today admitted the scarecrow an accent of pride in his voice  then if you are sufficiently rested and refreshed let us bend our steps toward the emerald city suggested the magnified one  we can’t said tip the saw-horse has broken a leg so he can’t bend his steps and there is no wood around to make him a new limb from and we can’t leave the horse behind because the pumpkinhead is so stiff in his joints that he has to ride  how very unfortunate cried the woggle-bug then he looked the party over carefully and said   if the pumpkinhead is to ride why not use one of his legs to make a leg for the horse that carries him i judge that both are made of wood  now that is what i call real cleverness said the scarecrow approvingly i wonder my brains did not think of that long ago get to work my dear nick and fit the pumpkinhead’s leg to the saw-horse  jack was not especially pleased with this idea but he submitted to having his left leg amputated by the tin woodman and whittled down to fit the left leg of the saw-horse nor was the saw-horse especially pleased with the operation either for he growled a good deal about being butchered as he called it and afterward declared that the new leg was a disgrace to a respectable saw-horse  i beg you to be more careful in your speech said the pumpkinhead sharply remember if you please that it is my leg you are abusing  i cannot forget it retorted the saw-horse for it is quite as flimsy as the rest of your person  flimsy me flimsy cried jack in a rage how dare you call me flimsy  because you are built as absurdly as a jumping-jack sneered the horse rolling his knotty eyes in a vicious manner even your head won’t stay straight and you never can tell whether you are looking backwards or forwards  friends i entreat you not to quarrel pleaded the tin woodman anxiously as a matter of fact we are none of us above criticism so let us bear with each others’ faults  an excellent suggestion said the woggle-bug approvingly you must have an excellent heart my metallic friend  i have returned nick well pleased my heart is quite the best part of me but now let us start upon our journey  they perched the one-legged pumpkinhead upon the saw-horse and tied him to his seat with cords so that he could not possibly fall off  and then following the lead of the scarecrow they all advanced in the direction of the emerald city  [illustration  image175]  [illustration  image176]  [illustration  image177]     old mombi indulges in witchcraft   they soon discovered that the saw-horse limped for his new leg was a trifle too long so they were obliged to halt while the tin woodman chopped it down with his axe after which the wooden steed paced along more comfortably but the saw-horse was not entirely satisfied even yet  it was a shame that i broke my other leg it growled  on the contrary airily remarked the woggle-bug who was walking alongside you should consider the accident most fortunate for a horse is never of much use until he has been broken  i beg your pardon said tip rather provoked for he felt a warm interest in both the saw-horse and his man jack but permit me to say that your joke is a poor one and as old as it is poor  still it is a joke declared the woggle-bug firmly and a joke derived from a play upon words is considered among educated people to be eminently proper  what does that mean enquired the pumpkinhead stupidly  it means my dear friend explained the woggle-bug that our language contains many words having a double meaning and that to pronounce a joke that allows both meanings of a certain word proves the joker a person of culture and refinement who has moreover a thorough command of the language  i don’t believe that said tip plainly anybody can make a pun  not so rejoined the woggle-bug stiffly it requires education of a high order are you educated young sir  not especially admitted tip  then you cannot judge the matter i myself am thoroughly educated and i say that puns display genius for instance were i to ride upon this saw-horse he would not only be an animal he would become an equipage for he would then be a horse-and-buggy  at this the scarecrow gave a gasp and the tin woodman stopped short and looked reproachfully at the woggle-bug at the same time the saw-horse loudly snorted his derision and even the pumpkinhead put up his hand to hide the smile which because it was carved upon his face he could not change to a frown  but the woggle-bug strutted along as if he had made some brilliant remark and the scarecrow was obliged to say   i have heard my dear friend that a person can become over-educated and although i have a high respect for brains no matter how they may be arranged or classified i begin to suspect that yours are slightly tangled in any event i must beg you to restrain your superior education while in our society  we are not very particular added the tin woodman and we are exceedingly kind hearted but if your superior culture gets leaky again— he did not complete the sentence but he twirled his gleaming axe so carelessly that the woggle-bug looked frightened and shrank away to a safe distance  the others marched on in silence and the highly magnified one after a period of deep thought said in an humble voice   i will endeavor to restrain myself  that is all we can expect returned the scarecrow pleasantly and good nature being thus happily restored to the party they proceeded upon their way  when they again stopped to allow tip to rest—the boy being the only one that seemed to tire—the tin woodman noticed many small round holes in the grassy meadow  this must be a village of the field mice he said to the scarecrow i wonder if my old friend the queen of the mice is in this neighborhood  if she is she may be of great service to us answered the scarecrow who was impressed by a sudden thought see if you can call her my dear nick  so the tin woodman blew a shrill note upon a silver whistle that hung around his neck and presently a tiny grey mouse popped from a near-by hole and advanced fearlessly toward them for the tin woodman had once saved her life and the queen of the field mice knew he was to be trusted  good day your majesty said nick politely addressing the mouse i trust you are enjoying good health  thank you i am quite well answered the queen demurely as she sat up and displayed the tiny golden crown upon her head can i do anything to assist my old friends  you can indeed replied the scarecrow eagerly let me i intreat you take a dozen of your subjects with me to the emerald city  will they be injured in any way asked the queen doubtfully  i think not replied the scarecrow i will carry them hidden in the straw which stuffs my body and when i give them the signal by unbuttoning my jacket they have only to rush out and scamper home again as fast as they can by doing this they will assist me to regain my throne which the army of revolt has taken from me  in that case said the queen i will not refuse your request whenever you are ready i will call twelve of my most intelligent subjects  i am ready now returned the scarecrow then he lay flat upon the ground and unbuttoned his jacket displaying the mass of straw with which he was stuffed  the queen uttered a little piping call and in an instant a dozen pretty field mice had emerged from their holes and stood before their ruler awaiting her orders  [illustration  image181]  what the queen said to them none of our travelers could understand for it was in the mouse language but the field mice obeyed without hesitation running one after the other to the scarecrow and hiding themselves in the straw of his breast  when all of the twelve mice had thus concealed themselves the scarecrow buttoned his jacket securely and then arose and thanked the queen for her kindness  one thing more you might do to serve us suggested the tin woodman and that is to run ahead and show us the way to the emerald city for some enemy is evidently trying to prevent us from reaching it  i will do that gladly returned the queen are you ready  the tin woodman looked at tip  i’m rested said the boy let us start  then they resumed their journey the little grey queen of the field mice running swiftly ahead and then pausing until the travelers drew near when away she would dart again  without this unerring guide the scarecrow and his comrades might never have gained the emerald city for many were the obstacles thrown in their way by the arts of old mombi yet not one of the obstacles really existed—all were cleverly contrived deceptions for when they came to the banks of a rushing river that threatened to bar their way the little queen kept steadily on passing through the seeming flood in safety and our travelers followed her without encountering a single drop of water  again a high wall of granite towered high above their heads and opposed their advance but the grey field mouse walked straight through it and the others did the same the wall melting into mist as they passed it  afterward when they had stopped for a moment to allow tip to rest they saw forty roads branching off from their feet in forty different directions and soon these forty roads began whirling around like a mighty wheel first in one direction and then in the other completely bewildering their vision  but the queen called for them to follow her and darted off in a straight line and when they had gone a few paces the whirling pathways vanished and were seen no more  mombi’s last trick was the most fearful of all she sent a sheet of crackling flame rushing over the meadow to consume them and for the first time the scarecrow became afraid and turned to fly  if that fire reaches me i will be gone in no time said he trembling until his straw rattled it’s the most dangerous thing i ever encountered  i’m off too cried the saw-horse turning and prancing with agitation for my wood is so dry it would burn like kindlings  is fire dangerous to pumpkins asked jack fearfully  you’ll be baked like a tart—and so will i answered the woggle-bug getting down on all fours so he could run the faster  but the tin woodman having no fear of fire averted the stampede by a few sensible words  look at the field mouse he shouted the fire does not burn her in the least in fact it is no fire at all but only a deception  indeed to watch the little queen march calmly through the advancing flames restored courage to every member of the party and they followed her without being even scorched  this is surely a most extraordinary adventure said the woggle-bug who was greatly amazed for it upsets all the natural laws that i heard professor nowitall teach in the school-house  of course it does said the scarecrow wisely all magic is unnatural and for that reason is to be feared and avoided but i see before us the gates of the emerald city so i imagine we have now overcome all the magical obstacles that seemed to oppose us  indeed the walls of the city were plainly visible and the queen of the field mice who had guided them so faithfully came near to bid them good-bye  we are very grateful to your majesty for your kind assistance said the tin woodman bowing before the pretty creature  i am always pleased to be of service to my friends answered the queen and in a flash she had darted away upon her journey home  [illustration  image188]  [illustration  image189]     the prisoners of the queen   approaching the gateway of the emerald city the travelers found it guarded by two girls of the army of revolt who opposed their entrance by drawing the knitting-needles from their hair and threatening to prod the first that came near  but the tin woodman was not afraid  at the worst they can but scratch my beautiful nickel-plate he said but there will be no ‘worst’ for i think i can manage to frighten these absurd soldiers very easily follow me closely all of you  then swinging his axe in a great circle to right and left before him he advanced upon the gate and the others followed him without hesitation  the girls who had expected no resistance whatever were terrified by the sweep of the glittering axe and fled screaming into the city so that our travelers passed the gates in safety and marched down the green marble pavement of the wide street toward the royal palace  at this rate we will soon have your majesty upon the throne again said the tin woodman laughing at his easy conquest of the guards  thank you friend nick returned the scarecrow gratefully nothing can resist your kind heart and your sharp axe  as they passed the rows of houses they saw through the open doors that men were sweeping and dusting and washing dishes while the women sat around in groups gossiping and laughing  what has happened the scarecrow asked a sad-looking man with a bushy beard who wore an apron and was wheeling a baby-carriage along the sidewalk  why we’ve had a revolution your majesty as you ought to know very well replied the man and since you went away the women have been running things to suit themselves i’m glad you have decided to come back and restore order for doing housework and minding the children is wearing out the strength of every man in the emerald city  hm said the scarecrow thoughtfully if it is such hard work as you say how did the women manage it so easily  i really do not know replied the man with a deep sigh perhaps the women are made of castiron  no movement was made as they passed along the street to oppose their progress several of the women stopped their gossip long enough to cast curious looks upon our friends but immediately they would turn away with a laugh or a sneer and resume their chatter and when they met with several girls belonging to the army of revolt those soldiers instead of being alarmed or appearing surprised merely stepped out of the way and allowed them to advance without protest  this action rendered the scarecrow uneasy  i’m afraid we are walking into a trap said he  nonsense returned nick chopper confidently the silly creatures are conquered already  but the scarecrow shook his head in a way that expressed doubt and tip said   [illustration  image192]  it’s too easy altogether look out for trouble ahead  i will returned his majesty unopposed they reached the royal palace and marched up the marble steps which had once been thickly crusted with emeralds but were now filled with tiny holes where the jewels had been ruthlessly torn from their settings by the army of revolt and so far not a rebel barred their way  through the arched hallways and into the magnificent throne room marched the tin woodman and his followers and here when the green silken curtains fell behind them they saw a curious sight  seated within the glittering throne was general jinjur with the scarecrow’s second-best crown upon her head and the royal sceptre in her right hand a box of caramels from which she was eating rested in her lap and the girl seemed entirely at ease in her royal surroundings  the scarecrow stepped forward and confronted her while the tin woodman leaned upon his axe and the others formed a half-circle back of his majesty’s person  how dare you sit in my throne demanded the scarecrow sternly eyeing the intruder don’t you know you are guilty of treason and that there is a law against treason  the throne belongs to whoever is able to take it answered jinjur as she slowly ate another caramel i have taken it as you see so just now i am the queen and all who oppose me are guilty of treason and must be punished by the law you have just mentioned  this view of the case puzzled the scarecrow  how is it friend nick he asked turning to the tin woodman  why when it comes to law i have nothing to say answered that personage for laws were never meant to be understood and it is foolish to make the attempt  then what shall we do asked the scarecrow in dismay  why don’t you marry the queen and then you can both rule suggested the woggle-bug  jinjur glared at the insect fiercely why don’t you send her back to her mother where she belongs asked jack pumpkinhead  jinjur frowned  why don’t you shut her up in a closet until she behaves herself and promises to be good enquired tip jinjur’s lip curled scornfully  or give her a good shaking added the saw-horse  no said the tin woodman we must treat the poor girl with gentleness let us give her all the jewels she can carry and send her away happy and contented  [illustration  image195]  at this queen jinjur laughed aloud and the next minute clapped her pretty hands together thrice as if for a signal  you are very absurd creatures said she but i am tired of your nonsense and have no time to bother with you longer  while the monarch and his friends listened in amazement to this impudent speech a startling thing happened the tin woodman’s axe was snatched from his grasp by some person behind him and he found himself disarmed and helpless at the same instant a shout of laughter rang in the ears of the devoted band and turning to see whence this came they found themselves surrounded by the army of revolt the girls bearing in either hand their glistening knitting-needles the entire throne room seemed to be filled with the rebels and the scarecrow and his comrades realized that they were prisoners  you see how foolish it is to oppose a woman’s wit said jinjur gaily and this event only proves that i am more fit to rule the emerald city than a scarecrow i bear you no ill will i assure you but lest you should prove troublesome to me in the future i shall order you all to be destroyed that is all except the boy who belongs to old mombi and must be restored to her keeping the rest of you are not human and therefore it will not be wicked to demolish you the saw-horse and the pumpkinhead’s body i will have chopped up for kindling-wood and the pumpkin shall be made into tarts the scarecrow will do nicely to start a bonfire and the tin man can be cut into small pieces and fed to the goats as for this immense woggle-bug—  highly magnified if you please interrupted the insect  i think i will ask the cook to make green-turtle soup of you continued the queen reflectively  the woggle-bug shuddered  or if that won’t do we might use you for a hungarian goulash stewed and highly spiced she added cruelly  this programme of extermination was so terrible that the prisoners looked upon one another in a panic of fear the scarecrow alone did not give way to despair he stood quietly before the queen and his brow was wrinkled in deep thought as he strove to find some means to escape  while thus engaged he felt the straw within his breast move gently at once his expression changed from sadness to joy and raising his hand he quickly unbuttoned the front of his jacket  this action did not pass unnoticed by the crowd of girls clustering about him but none of them suspected what he was doing until a tiny grey mouse leaped from his bosom to the floor and scampered away between the feet of the army of revolt another mouse quickly followed then another and another in rapid succession and suddenly such a scream of terror went up from the army that it might easily have filled the stoutest heart with consternation the flight that ensued turned to a stampede and the stampede to a panic  for while the startled mice rushed wildly about the room the scarecrow had only time to note a whirl of skirts and a twinkling of feet as the girls disappeared from the palace—pushing and crowding one another in their mad efforts to escape  the queen at the first alarm stood up on the cushions of the throne and began to dance frantically upon her tiptoes then a mouse ran up the cushions and with a terrified leap poor jinjur shot clear over the head of the scarecrow and escaped through an archway—never pausing in her wild career until she had reached the city gates  so in less time than i can explain the throne room was deserted by all save the scarecrow and his friends and the woggle-bug heaved a deep sigh of relief as he exclaimed   thank goodness we are saved  for a time yes answered the tin woodman but the enemy will soon return i fear  let us bar all the entrances to the palace said the scarecrow then we shall have time to think what is best to be done  so all except jack pumpkinhead who was still tied fast to the saw-horse ran to the various entrances of the royal palace and closed the heavy doors bolting and locking them securely then knowing that the army of revolt could not batter down the barriers in several days the adventurers gathered once more in the throne room for a council of war  [illustration  image201]  [illustration  image202]  [illustration  image203]     the scarecrow takes time to think   it seems to me began the scarecrow when all were again assembled in the throne room that the girl jinjur is quite right in claiming to be queen and if she is right then i am wrong and we have no business to be occupying her palace  but you were the king until she came said the woggle-bug strutting up and down with his hands in his pockets so it appears to me that she is the interloper instead of you  especially as we have just conquered her and put her to flight added the pumpkinhead as he raised his hands to turn his face toward the scarecrow  have we really conquered her asked the scarecrow quietly look out of the window and tell me what you see  tip ran to the window and looked out  the palace is surrounded by a double row of girl soldiers he announced  i thought so returned the scarecrow we are as truly their prisoners as we were before the mice frightened them from the palace  my friend is right said nick chopper who had been polishing his breast with a bit of chamois-leather jinjur is still the queen and we are her prisoners  but i hope she cannot get at us exclaimed the pumpkinhead with a shiver of fear she threatened to make tarts of me you know  don’t worry said the tin woodman it cannot matter greatly if you stay shut up here you will spoil in time anyway a good tart is far more admirable than a decayed intellect  very true agreed the scarecrow  oh dear moaned jack what an unhappy lot is mine why dear father did you not make me out of tin—or even out of straw—so that i would keep indefinitely  shucks returned tip indignantly you ought to be glad that i made you at all then he added reflectively everything has to come to an end some time  but i beg to remind you broke in the woggle-bug who had a distressed look in his bulging round eyes that this terrible queen jinjur suggested making a goulash of me—me the only highly magnified and thoroughly educated woggle-bug in the wide wide world  i think it was a brilliant idea remarked the scarecrow approvingly  don’t you imagine he would make a better soup asked the tin woodman turning toward his friend  well perhaps acknowledged the scarecrow  the woggle-bug groaned  i can see in my mind’s eye said he mournfully the goats eating small pieces of my dear comrade the tin woodman while my soup is being cooked on a bonfire built of the saw-horse and jack pumpkinhead’s body and queen jinjur watches me boil while she feeds the flames with my friend the scarecrow  [illustration  image205]  this morbid picture cast a gloom over the entire party making them restless and anxious  it can’t happen for some time said the tin woodman trying to speak cheerfully for we shall be able to keep jinjur out of the palace until she manages to break down the doors  and in the meantime i am liable to starve to death and so is the woggle-bug announced tip  as for me said the woggle-bug i think that i could live for some time on jack pumpkinhead not that i prefer pumpkins for food but i believe they are somewhat nutritious and jack’s head is large and plump  how heartless exclaimed the tin woodman greatly shocked are we cannibals let me ask or are we faithful friends  i see very clearly that we cannot stay shut up in this palace said the scarecrow with decision so let us end this mournful talk and try to discover a means to escape  at this suggestion they all gathered eagerly around the throne wherein was seated the scarecrow and as tip sat down upon a stool there fell from his pocket a pepper-box which rolled upon the floor  what is this asked nick chopper picking up the box  be careful cried the boy that’s my powder of life don’t spill it for it is nearly gone  and what is the powder of life enquired the scarecrow as tip replaced the box carefully in his pocket  it’s some magical stuff old mombi got from a crooked sorcerer explained the boy she brought jack to life with it and afterward i used it to bring the saw-horse to life i guess it will make anything live that is sprinkled with it but there’s only about one dose left  then it is very precious said the tin woodman  indeed it is agreed the scarecrow it may prove our best means of escape from our difficulties i believe i will think for a few minutes so i will thank you friend tip to get out your knife and rip this heavy crown from my forehead  tip soon cut the stitches that had fastened the crown to the scarecrow’s head and the former monarch of the emerald city removed it with a sigh of relief and hung it on a peg beside the throne  [illustration  image209]  that is my last memento of royalty said he and i’m glad to get rid of it the former king of this city who was named pastoria lost the crown to the wonderful wizard who passed it on to me now the girl jinjur claims it and i sincerely hope it will not give her a headache  a kindly thought which i greatly admire said the tin woodman nodding approvingly  and now i will indulge in a quiet think continued the scarecrow lying back in the throne  the others remained as silent and still as possible so as not to disturb him for all had great confidence in the extraordinary brains of the scarecrow  and after what seemed a very long time indeed to the anxious watchers the thinker sat up looked upon his friends with his most whimsical expression and said   my brains work beautifully today i’m quite proud of them now listen if we attempt to escape through the doors of the palace we shall surely be captured and as we can’t escape through the ground there is only one other thing to be done we must escape through the air  he paused to note the effect of these words but all his hearers seemed puzzled and unconvinced  the wonderful wizard escaped in a balloon he continued we don’t know how to make a balloon of course but any sort of thing that can fly through the air can carry us easily so i suggest that my friend the tin woodman who is a skillful mechanic shall build some sort of a machine with good strong wings to carry us and our friend tip can then bring the thing to life with his magical powder  bravo cried nick chopper  what splendid brains murmured jack  really quite clever said the educated woggle-bug  i believe it can be done declared tip that is if the tin woodman is equal to making the thing  i’ll do my best said nick cheerily and as a matter of fact i do not often fail in what i attempt but the thing will have to be built on the roof of the palace so it can rise comfortably into the air  [illustration  image211]  to be sure said the scarecrow  then let us search through the palace continued the tin woodman and carry all the material we can find to the roof where i will begin my work  first however said the pumpkinhead i beg you will release me from this horse and make me another leg to walk with for in my present condition i am of no use to myself or to anyone else  so the tin woodman knocked a mahogany center-table to pieces with his axe and fitted one of the legs which was beautifully carved on to the body of jack pumpkinhead who was very proud of the acquisition  it seems strange said he as he watched the tin woodman work that my left leg should be the most elegant and substantial part of me  that proves you are unusual returned the scarecrow and i am convinced that the only people worthy of consideration in this world are the unusual ones for the common folks are like the leaves of a tree and live and die unnoticed  spoken like a philosopher cried the woggle-bug as he assisted the tin woodman to set jack upon his feet  how do you feel now asked tip watching the pumpkinhead stump around to try his new leg  as good as new answered jack joyfully and quite ready to assist you all to escape  then let us get to work said the scarecrow in a business-like tone  so glad to be doing anything that might lead to the end of their captivity the friends separated to wander over the palace in search of fitting material to use in the construction of their aerial machine  [illustration  image213]  [illustration  image214]  [illustration  image215]     the astonishing flight of the gump   when the adventurers reassembled upon the roof it was found that a remarkably queer assortment of articles had been selected by the various members of the party no one seemed to have a very clear idea of what was required but all had brought something  the woggle-bug had taken from its position over the mantle-piece in the great hallway the head of a gump which was adorned with wide-spreading antlers and this with great care and greater difficulty the insect had carried up the stairs to the roof this gump resembled an elk’s head only the nose turned upward in a saucy manner and there were whiskers upon its chin like those of a billy-goat why the woggle-bug selected this article he could not have explained except that it had aroused his curiosity  tip with the aid of the saw-horse had brought a large upholstered sofa to the roof it was an oldfashioned piece of furniture with high back and ends and it was so heavy that even by resting the greatest weight upon the back of the saw-horse the boy found himself out of breath when at last the clumsy sofa was dumped upon the roof  [illustration  image217]  the pumpkinhead had brought a broom which was the first thing he saw the scarecrow arrived with a coil of clothes-lines and ropes which he had taken from the courtyard and in his trip up the stairs he had become so entangled in the loose ends of the ropes that both he and his burden tumbled in a heap upon the roof and might have rolled off if tip had not rescued him  the tin woodman appeared last he also had been to the courtyard where he had cut four great spreading leaves from a huge palm-tree that was the pride of all the inhabitants of the emerald city  my dear nick exclaimed the scarecrow seeing what his friend had done you have been guilty of the greatest crime any person can commit in the emerald city if i remember rightly the penalty for chopping leaves from the royal palm-tree is to be killed seven times and afterward imprisoned for life  it cannot be helped now answered the tin woodman throwing down the big leaves upon the roof but it may be one more reason why it is necessary for us to escape and now let us see what you have found for me to work with  many were the doubtful looks cast upon the heap of miscellaneous material that now cluttered the roof and finally the scarecrow shook his head and remarked   well if friend nick can manufacture from this mess of rubbish a thing that will fly through the air and carry us to safety then i will acknowledge him to be a better mechanic than i suspected  but the tin woodman seemed at first by no means sure of his powers and only after polishing his forehead vigorously with the chamois-leather did he resolve to undertake the task  the first thing required for the machine said he is a body big enough to carry the entire party this sofa is the biggest thing we have and might be used for a body but should the machine ever tip sideways we would all slide off and fall to the ground  why not use two sofas asked tip there’s another one just like this down stairs  that is a very sensible suggestion exclaimed the tin woodman you must fetch the other sofa at once  so tip and the saw-horse managed with much labor to get the second sofa to the roof and when the two were placed together edge to edge the backs and ends formed a protecting rampart all around the seats  excellent cried the scarecrow we can ride within this snug nest quite at our ease  the two sofas were now bound firmly together with ropes and clothes-lines and then nick chopper fastened the gump’s head to one end  that will show which is the front end of the thing said he greatly pleased with the idea and really if you examine it critically the gump looks very well as a figure-head these great palm-leaves for which i have endangered my life seven times must serve us as wings  are they strong enough asked the boy  they are as strong as anything we can get answered the woodman and although they are not in proportion to the thing’s body we are not in a position to be very particular  so he fastened the palm-leaves to the sofas two on each side  said the woggle-bug with considerable admiration   the thing is now complete and only needs to be brought to life  stop a moment exclaimed jack are you not going to use my broom  what for asked the scarecrow  why it can be fastened to the back end for a tail answered the pumpkinhead surely you would not call the thing complete without a tail  hm said the tin woodman i do not see the use of a tail we are not trying to copy a beast or a fish or a bird all we ask of the thing is to carry us through the air  perhaps after the thing is brought to life it can use a tail to steer with suggested the scarecrow for if it flies through the air it will not be unlike a bird and i’ve noticed that all birds have tails which they use for a rudder while flying  very well answered nick the broom shall be used for a tail and he fastened it firmly to the back end of the sofa body  tip took the pepper-box from his pocket  the thing looks very big said he anxiously and i am not sure there is enough powder left to bring all of it to life but i’ll make it go as far as possible  put most on the wings said nick chopper for they must be made as strong as possible  and don’t forget the head exclaimed the woggle-bug  or the tail added jack pumpkinhead  do be quiet said tip nervously you must give me a chance to work the magic charm in the proper manner  very carefully he began sprinkling the thing with the precious powder each of the four wings was first lightly covered with a layer then the sofas were sprinkled and the broom given a slight coating  the head the head don’t i beg of you forget the head cried the woggle-bug excitedly  there’s only a little of the powder left announced tip looking within the box and it seems to me it is more important to bring the legs of the sofas to life than the head  not so decided the scarecrow every thing must have a head to direct it and since this creature is to fly and not walk it is really unimportant whether its legs are alive or not  so tip abided by this decision and sprinkled the gump’s head with the remainder of the powder  now said he keep silence while i work the charm  having heard old mombi pronounce the magic words and having also succeeded in bringing the saw-horse to life tip did not hesitate an instant in speaking the three cabalistic words each accompanied by the peculiar gesture of the hands  it was a grave and impressive ceremony  as he finished the incantation the thing shuddered throughout its huge bulk the gump gave the screeching cry that is familiar to those animals and then the four wings began flopping furiously  [illustration  image222]  tip managed to grasp a chimney else he would have been blown off the roof by the terrible breeze raised by the wings the scarecrow being light in weight was caught up bodily and borne through the air until tip luckily seized him by one leg and held him fast the woggle-bug lay flat upon the roof and so escaped harm and the tin woodman whose weight of tin anchored him firmly threw both arms around jack pumpkinhead and managed to save him the saw-horse toppled over upon his back and lay with his legs waving helplessly above him  and now while all were struggling to recover themselves the thing rose slowly from the roof and mounted into the air  here come back cried tip in a frightened voice as he clung to the chimney with one hand and the scarecrow with the other come back at once i command you  it was now that the wisdom of the scarecrow in bringing the head of the thing to life instead of the legs was proved beyond a doubt for the gump already high in the air turned its head at tip’s command and gradually circled around until it could view the roof of the palace  come back shouted the boy again  and the gump obeyed slowly and gracefully waving its four wings in the air until the thing had settled once more upon the roof and become still  [illustration  image224]  [illustration  image225]     in the jackdaw’s nest   this said the gump in a squeaky voice not at all proportioned to the size of its great body is the most novel experience i ever heard of the last thing i remember distinctly is walking through the forest and hearing a loud noise something probably killed me then and it certainly ought to have been the end of me yet here i am alive again with four monstrous wings and a body which i venture to say would make any respectable animal or fowl weep with shame to own what does it all mean am i a gump or am i a juggernaut the creature as it spoke wiggled its chin whiskers in a very comical manner  you’re just a thing answered tip with a gump’s head on it and we have made you and brought you to life so that you may carry us through the air wherever we wish to go  very good said the thing as i am not a gump i cannot have a gump’s pride or independent spirit so i may as well become your servant as anything else my only satisfaction is that i do not seem to have a very strong constitution and am not likely to live long in a state of slavery  don’t say that i beg of you cried the tin woodman whose excellent heart was strongly affected by this sad speech are you not feeling well today  oh as for that returned the gump it is my first day of existence so i cannot judge whether i am feeling well or ill and it waved its broom tail to and fro in a pensive manner  come come said the scarecrow kindly do try to be more cheerful and take life as you find it we shall be kind masters and will strive to render your existence as pleasant as possible are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go  certainly answered the gump i greatly prefer to navigate the air for should i travel on the earth and meet with one of my own species my embarrassment would be something awful  i can appreciate that said the tin woodman sympathetically  and yet continued the thing when i carefully look you over my masters none of you seems to be constructed much more artistically than i am  appearances are deceitful said the woggle-bug earnestly i am both highly magnified and thoroughly educated  indeed murmured the gump indifferently  and my brains are considered remarkably rare specimens added the scarecrow proudly  how strange remarked the gump  although i am of tin said the woodman i own a heart altogether the warmest and most admirable in the whole world  i’m delighted to hear it replied the gump with a slight cough  my smile said jack pumpkinhead is worthy your best attention it is always the same  semper idem explained the woggle-bug pompously and the gump turned to stare at him  and i declared the saw-horse filling in an awkward pause am only remarkable because i can’t help it  i am proud indeed to meet with such exceptional masters said the gump in a careless tone if i could but secure so complete an introduction to myself i would be more than satisfied  that will come in time remarked the scarecrow to ‘know thyself’ is considered quite an accomplishment which it has taken us who are your elders months to perfect but now he added turning to the others let us get aboard and start upon our journey  where shall we go asked tip as he clambered to a seat on the sofas and assisted the pumpkinhead to follow him  in the south country rules a very delightful queen called glinda the good who i am sure will gladly receive us said the scarecrow getting into the thing clumsily let us go to her and ask her advice  that is cleverly thought of declared nick chopper giving the woggle-bug a boost and then toppling the saw-horse into the rear end of the cushioned seats i know glinda the good and believe she will prove a friend indeed  are we all ready asked the boy  yes announced the tin woodman seating himself beside the scarecrow  then said tip addressing the gump be kind enough to fly with us to the southward and do not go higher than to escape the houses and trees for it makes me dizzy to be up so far  all right answered the gump briefly  it flopped its four huge wings and rose slowly into the air and then while our little band of adventurers clung to the backs and sides of the sofas for support the gump turned toward the south and soared swiftly and majestically away  [illustration  image229]  the scenic effect from this altitude is marvelous commented the educated woggle-bug as they rode along  never mind the scenery said the scarecrow hold on tight or you may get a tumble the thing seems to rock badly  it will be dark soon said tip observing that the sun was low on the horizon perhaps we should have waited until morning i wonder if the gump can fly in the night  i’ve been wondering that myself returned the gump quietly you see this is a new experience to me i used to have legs that carried me swiftly over the ground but now my legs feel as if they were asleep  they are said tip we didn’t bring ’em to life  you’re expected to fly explained the scarecrow not to walk  we can walk ourselves said the woggle-bug  i begin to understand what is required of me remarked the gump so i will do my best to please you and he flew on for a time in silence  presently jack pumpkinhead became uneasy  i wonder if riding through the air is liable to spoil pumpkins he said  not unless you carelessly drop your head over the side answered the woggle-bug in that event your head would no longer be a pumpkin for it would become a squash  have i not asked you to restrain these unfeeling jokes demanded tip looking at the woggle-bug with a severe expression  you have and i’ve restrained a good many of them replied the insect but there are opportunities for so many excellent puns in our language that to an educated person like myself the temptation to express them is almost irresistible  people with more or less education discovered those puns centuries ago said tip  are you sure asked the woggle-bug with a startled look  of course i am answered the boy an educated woggle-bug may be a new thing but a woggle-bug education is as old as the hills judging from the display you make of it  the insect seemed much impressed by this remark and for a time maintained a meek silence  the scarecrow in shifting his seat saw upon the cushions the pepper-box which tip had cast aside and began to examine it  throw it overboard said the boy it’s quite empty now and there’s no use keeping it  is it really empty asked the scarecrow looking curiously into the box  of course it is answered tip i shook out every grain of the powder  then the box has two bottoms announced the scarecrow for the bottom on the inside is fully an inch away from the bottom on the outside  let me see said the tin woodman taking the box from his friend yes he declared after looking it over the thing certainly has a false bottom now i wonder what that is for  can’t you get it apart and find out enquired tip now quite interested in the mystery  why yes the lower bottom unscrews said the tin woodman my fingers are rather stiff please see if you can open it  he handed the pepper-box to tip who had no difficulty in unscrewing the bottom and in the cavity below were three silver pills with a carefully folded paper lying underneath them  this paper the boy proceeded to unfold taking care not to spill the pills and found several lines clearly written in red ink  read it aloud said the scarecrow so tip read as follows   dr nikidik’s celebrated wishing pills  directions for use  swallow one pill count seventeen by twos then make a wish the wish will immediately be granted  caution  keep in a dry and dark place  why this is a very valuable discovery cried the scarecrow  it is indeed replied tip gravely these pills may be of great use to us i wonder if old mombi knew they were in the bottom of the pepper-box i remember hearing her say that she got the powder of life from this same nikidik  he must be a powerful sorcerer exclaimed the tin woodman and since the powder proved a success we ought to have confidence in the pills  but how asked the scarecrow can anyone count seventeen by twos seventeen is an odd number  that is true replied tip greatly disappointed no one can possibly count seventeen by twos  then the pills are of no use to us wailed the pumpkinhead and this fact overwhelms me with grief for i had intended wishing that my head would never spoil  nonsense said the scarecrow sharply if we could use the pills at all we would make far better wishes than that  i do not see how anything could be better protested poor jack if you were liable to spoil at any time you could understand my anxiety  for my part said the tin woodman i sympathize with you in every respect but since we cannot count seventeen by twos sympathy is all you are liable to get  by this time it had become quite dark and the voyagers found above them a cloudy sky through which the rays of the moon could not penetrate  the gump flew steadily on and for some reason the huge sofa-body rocked more and more dizzily every hour  the woggle-bug declared he was sea-sick and tip was also pale and somewhat distressed but the others clung to the backs of the sofas and did not seem to mind the motion as long as they were not tipped out  darker and darker grew the night and on and on sped the gump through the black heavens the travelers could not even see one another and an oppressive silence settled down upon them  after a long time tip who had been thinking deeply spoke  how are we to know when we come to the pallace of glinda the good he asked  it’s a long way to glinda’s palace answered the woodman i’ve traveled it  but how are we to know how fast the gump is flying persisted the boy we cannot see a single thing down on the earth and before morning we may be far beyond the place we want to reach  that is all true enough the scarecrow replied a little uneasily but i do not see how we can stop just now for we might alight in a river or on the top of a steeple and that would be a great disaster  so they permitted the gump to fly on with regular flops of its great wings and waited patiently for morning  then tip’s fears were proven to be well founded for with the first streaks of gray dawn they looked over the sides of the sofas and discovered rolling plains dotted with queer villages where the houses instead of being dome-shaped—as they all are in the land of oz—had slanting roofs that rose to a peak in the center odd looking animals were also moving about upon the open plains and the country was unfamiliar to both the tin woodman and the scarecrow who had formerly visited glinda the good’s domain and knew it well  we are lost said the scarecrow dolefully the gump must have carried us entirely out of the land of oz and over the sandy deserts and into the terrible outside world that dorothy told us about  we must get back exclaimed the tin woodman earnestly we must get back as soon as possible  turn around cried tip to the gump turn as quickly as you can  if i do i shall upset answered the gump i’m not at all used to flying and the best plan would be for me to alight in some place and then i can turn around and take a fresh start  just then however there seemed to be no stopping-place that would answer their purpose they flew over a village so big that the woggle-bug declared it was a city and then they came to a range of high mountains with many deep gorges and steep cliffs showing plainly  now is our chance to stop said the boy finding they were very close to the mountain tops then he turned to the gump and commanded  stop at the first level place you see  very well answered the gump and settled down upon a table of rock that stood between two cliffs  but not being experienced in such matters the gump did not judge his speed correctly and instead of coming to a stop upon the flat rock he missed it by half the width of his body breaking off both his right wings against the sharp edge of the rock and then tumbling over and over down the cliff  our friends held on to the sofas as long as they could but when the gump caught on a projecting rock the thing stopped suddenly—bottom side up—and all were immediately dumped out  [illustration  image239]  by good fortune they fell only a few feet for underneath them was a monster nest built by a colony of jackdaws in a hollow ledge of rock so none of them—not even the pumpkinhead—was injured by the fall for jack found his precious head resting on the soft breast of the scarecrow which made an excellent cushion and tip fell on a mass of leaves and papers which saved him from injury the woggle-bug had bumped his round head against the saw-horse but without causing him more than a moment’s inconvenience  the tin woodman was at first much alarmed but finding he had escaped without even a scratch upon his beautiful nickle-plate he at once regained his accustomed cheerfulness and turned to address his comrades  our journey had ended rather suddenly said he and we cannot justly blame our friend the gump for our accident because he did the best he could under the circumstances but how we are ever to escape from this nest i must leave to someone with better brains than i possess  here he gazed at the scarecrow who crawled to the edge of the nest and looked over below them was a sheer precipice several hundred feet in depth above them was a smooth cliff unbroken save by the point of rock where the wrecked body of the gump still hung suspended from the end of one of the sofas there really seemed to be no means of escape and as they realized their helpless plight the little band of adventurers gave way to their bewilderment  this is a worse prison than the palace sadly remarked the woggle-bug  i wish we had stayed there moaned jack  i’m afraid the mountain air isn’t good for pumpkins  it won’t be when the jackdaws come back growled the saw-horse which lay waving its legs in a vain endeavor to get upon its feet again jackdaws are especially fond of pumpkins  do you think the birds will come here asked jack much distressed  of course they will said tip for this is their nest and there must be hundreds of them he continued for see what a lot of things they have brought here  indeed the nest was half filled with a most curious collection of small articles for which the birds could have no use but which the thieving jackdaws had stolen during many years from the homes of men and as the nest was safely hidden where no human being could reach it this lost property would never be recovered  [illustration  image242]  the woggle-bug searching among the rubbish—for the jackdaws stole useless things as well as valuable ones—turned up with his foot a beautiful diamond necklace this was so greatly admired by the tin woodman that the woggle-bug presented it to him with a graceful speech after which the woodman hung it around his neck with much pride rejoicing exceedingly when the big diamonds glittered in the sun’s rays  but now they heard a great jabbering and flopping of wings and as the sound grew nearer to them tip exclaimed   the jackdaws are coming and if they find us here they will surely kill us in their anger  i was afraid of this moaned the pumpkinhead my time has come  and mine also said the woggle-bug for jackdaws are the greatest enemies of my race  the others were not at all afraid but the scarecrow at once decided to save those of the party who were liable to be injured by the angry birds so he commanded tip to take off jack’s head and lie down with it in the bottom of the nest and when this was done he ordered the woggle-bug to lie beside tip nick chopper who knew from past experience just what to do then took the scarecrow to pieces all except his head and scattered the straw over tip and the woggle-bug completely covering their bodies  hardly had this been accomplished when the flock of jackdaws reached them perceiving the intruders in their nest the birds flew down upon them with screams of rage  [illustration  image244]  [illustration  image245]     dr nikidik’s famous wishing pills   the tin woodman was usually a peaceful man but when occasion required he could fight as fiercely as a roman gladiator so when the jackdaws nearly knocked him down in their rush of wings and their sharp beaks and claws threatened to damage his brilliant plating the woodman picked up his axe and made it whirl swiftly around his head  but although many were beaten off in this way the birds were so numerous and so brave that they continued the attack as furiously as before some of them pecked at the eyes of the gump which hung over the nest in a helpless condition but the gump’s eyes were of glass and could not be injured others of the jackdaws rushed at the saw-horse but that animal being still upon his back kicked out so viciously with his wooden legs that he beat off as many assailants as did the woodman’s axe  finding themselves thus opposed the birds fell upon the scarecrow’s straw which lay at the center of the nest covering tip and the woggle-bug and jack’s pumpkin head and began tearing it away and flying off with it only to let it drop straw by straw into the great gulf beneath  [illustration  image247]  the scarecrow’s head noting with dismay this wanton destruction of his interior cried to the tin woodman to save him and that good friend responded with renewed energy his axe fairly flashed among the jackdaws and fortunately the gump began wildly waving the two wings remaining on the left side of its body the flutter of these great wings filled the jackdaws with terror and when the gump by its exertions freed itself from the peg of rock on which it hung and sank flopping into the nest the alarm of the birds knew no bounds and they fled screaming over the mountains  when the last foe had disappeared tip crawled from under the sofas and assisted the woggle-bug to follow him  we are saved shouted the boy delightedly  we are indeed responded the educated insect fairly hugging the stiff head of the gump in his joy and we owe it all to the flopping of the thing and the good axe of the woodman  if i am saved get me out of here called jack whose head was still beneath the sofas and tip managed to roll the pumpkin out and place it upon its neck again he also set the saw-horse upright and said to it   we owe you many thanks for the gallant fight you made  i really think we have escaped very nicely remarked the tin woodman in a tone of pride  not so exclaimed a hollow voice  at this they all turned in surprise to look at the scarecrow’s head which lay at the back of the nest  i am completely ruined declared the scarecrow as he noted their astonishment for where is the straw that stuffs my body  the awful question startled them all they gazed around the nest with horror for not a vestige of straw remained the jackdaws had stolen it to the last wisp and flung it all into the chasm that yawned for hundreds of feet beneath the nest  [illustration  image249]  my poor poor friend said the tin woodman taking up the scarecrow’s head and caressing it tenderly whoever could imagine you would come to this untimely end  i did it to save my friends returned the head and i am glad that i perished in so noble and unselfish a manner  but why are you all so despondent inquired the woggle-bug the scarecrow’s clothing is still safe  yes answered the tin woodman but our friend’s clothes are useless without stuffing  why not stuff him with money asked tip  money they all cried in an amazed chorus  to be sure said the boy in the bottom of the nest are thousands of dollar bills—and two-dollar bills—and five-dollar bills—and tens and twenties and fifties there are enough of them to stuff a dozen scarecrows why not use the money  the tin woodman began to turn over the rubbish with the handle of his axe and sure enough what they had first thought only worthless papers were found to be all bills of various denominations which the mischievous jackdaws had for years been engaged in stealing from the villages and cities they visited  there was an immense fortune lying in that inaccessible nest and tip’s suggestion was with the scarecrow’s consent quickly acted upon  they selected all the newest and cleanest bills and assorted them into various piles the scarecrow’s left leg and boot were stuffed with five-dollar bills his right leg was stuffed with ten-dollar bills and his body so closely filled with fifties one-hundreds and one-thousands that he could scarcely button his jacket with comfort  [illustration  image251]  you are now said the woggle-bug impressively when the task had been completed the most valuable member of our party and as you are among faithful friends there is little danger of your being spent  thank you returned the scarecrow gratefully i feel like a new man and although at first glance i might be mistaken for a safety deposit vault i beg you to remember that my brains are still composed of the same old material and these are the possessions that have always made me a person to be depended upon in an emergency  well the emergency is here observed tip and unless your brains help us out of it we shall be compelled to pass the remainder of our lives in this nest  how about these wishing pills enquired the scarecrow taking the box from his jacket pocket can’t we use them to escape  not unless we can count seventeen by twos answered the tin woodman but our friend the woggle-bug claims to be highly educated so he ought easily to figure out how that can be done  it isn’t a question of education returned the insect it’s merely a question of mathematics i’ve seen the professor work lots of sums on the blackboard and he claimed anything could be done with x’s and y’s and a’s and such things by mixing them up with plenty of plusses and minuses and equals and so forth but he never said anything so far as i can remember about counting up to the odd number of seventeen by the even numbers of twos  stop stop cried the pumpkinhead you’re making my head ache  and mine added the scarecrow your mathematics seem to me very like a bottle of mixed pickles the more you fish for what you want the less chance you have of getting it i am certain that if the thing can be accomplished at all it is in a very simple manner  yes said tip old mombi couldn’t use x’s and minuses for she never went to school  why not start counting at a half of one asked the saw-horse abruptly then anyone can count up to seventeen by twos very easily  they looked at each other in surprise for the saw-horse was considered the most stupid of the entire party  you make me quite ashamed of myself said the scarecrow bowing low to the saw-horse  nevertheless the creature is right declared the woggle-bug for twice one-half is one and if you get to one it is easy to count from one up to seventeen by twos  i wonder i didn’t think of that myself said the pumpkinhead  i don’t returned the scarecrow you’re no wiser than the rest of us are you but let us make a wish at once who will swallow the first pill  suppose you do it suggested tip  i can’t said the scarecrow  why not you’ve a mouth haven’t you asked the boy  yes but my mouth is painted on and there’s no swallow connected with it answered the scarecrow in fact he continued looking from one to another critically i believe the boy and the woggle-bug are the only ones in our party that are able to swallow  observing the truth of this remark tip said   then i will undertake to make the first wish give me one of the silver pills  this the scarecrow tried to do but his padded gloves were too clumsy to clutch so small an object and he held the box toward the boy while tip selected one of the pills and swallowed it  count cried the scarecrow  one-half one three five seven nine eleven counted tip thirteen fifteen seventeen  now wish said the tin woodman anxiously   but just then the boy began to suffer such fearful pains that he became alarmed  the pill has poisoned me he gasped o—h o-o-o-o-o ouch murder fire o-o-h and here he rolled upon the bottom of the nest in such contortions that he frightened them all  what can we do for you speak i beg entreated the tin woodman tears of sympathy running down his nickel cheeks  i—i don’t know answered tip o—h i wish i’d never swallowed that pill  then at once the pain stopped and the boy rose to his feet again and found the scarecrow looking with amazement at the end of the pepper-box  what’s happened asked the boy a little ashamed of his recent exhibition  why the three pills are in the box again said the scarecrow  of course they are the woggle-bug declared didn’t tip wish that he’d never swallowed one of them well the wish came true and he didn’t swallow one of them so of course they are all three in the box  that may be but the pill gave me a dreadful pain just the same said the boy  impossible declared the woggle-bug if you have never swallowed it the pill can not have given you a pain and as your wish being granted proves you did not swallow the pill it is also plain that you suffered no pain  [illustration  image255]  then it was a splendid imitation of a pain retorted tip angrily suppose you try the next pill yourself we’ve wasted one wish already  oh no we haven’t protested the scarecrow here are still three pills in the box and each pill is good for a wish  now you’re making my head ache said tip i can’t understand the thing at all but i won’t take another pill i promise you and with this remark he retired sulkily to the back of the nest  well said the woggle-bug it remains for me to save us in my most highly magnified and thoroughly educated manner for i seem to be the only one able and willing to make a wish let me have one of the pills  he swallowed it without hesitation and they all stood admiring his courage while the insect counted seventeen by twos in the same way that tip had done and for some reason—perhaps because woggle-bugs have stronger stomachs than boys—the silver pellet caused it no pain whatever  i wish the gump’s broken wings mended and as good as new said the woggle-bug in a slow impressive voice  all turned to look at the thing and so quickly had the wish been granted that the gump lay before them in perfect repair and as well able to fly through the air as when it had first been brought to life on the roof of the palace  [illustration  image257]  [illustration  image258]  [illustration  image259]     the scarecrow appeals to glinda the good   hooray shouted the scarecrow gaily we can now leave this miserable jackdaws’ nest whenever we please  but it is nearly dark said the tin woodman and unless we wait until morning to make our flight we may get into more trouble i don’t like these night trips for one never knows what will happen  so it was decided to wait until daylight and the adventurers amused themselves in the twilight by searching the jackdaws’ nest for treasures  the woggle-bug found two handsome bracelets of wrought gold which fitted his slender arms very well the scarecrow took a fancy for rings of which there were many in the nest before long he had fitted a ring to each finger of his padded gloves and not being content with that display he added one more to each thumb as he carefully chose those rings set with sparkling stones such as rubies amethysts and sapphires the scarecrow’s hands now presented a most brilliant appearance  this nest would be a picnic for queen jinjur said he musingly for as nearly as i can make out she and her girls conquered me merely to rob my city of its emeralds  the tin woodman was content with his diamond necklace and refused to accept any additional decorations but tip secured a fine gold watch which was attached to a heavy fob and placed it in his pocket with much pride he also pinned several jeweled brooches to jack pumpkinhead’s red waistcoat and attached a lorgnette by means of a fine chain to the neck of the saw-horse  it’s very pretty said the creature regarding the lorgnette approvingly but what is it for  none of them could answer that question however so the saw-horse decided it was some rare decoration and became very fond of it  that none of the party might be slighted they ended by placing several large seal rings upon the points of the gump’s antlers although that odd personage seemed by no means gratified by the attention  darkness soon fell upon them and tip and the woggle-bug went to sleep while the others sat down to wait patiently for the day  next morning they had cause to congratulate themselves upon the useful condition of the gump for with daylight a great flock of jackdaws approached to engage in one more battle for the possession of the nest  but our adventurers did not wait for the assault they tumbled into the cushioned seats of the sofas as quickly as possible and tip gave the word to the gump to start  at once it rose into the air the great wings flopping strongly and with regular motions and in a few moments they were so far from the nest that the chattering jackdaws took possession without any attempt at pursuit  the thing flew due north going in the same direction from whence it had come at least that was the scarecrow’s opinion and the others agreed that the scarecrow was the best judge of direction after passing over several cities and villages the gump carried them high above a broad plain where houses became more and more scattered until they disappeared altogether next came the wide sandy desert separating the rest of the world from the land of oz and before noon they saw the dome-shaped houses that proved they were once more within the borders of their native land  but the houses and fences are blue said the tin woodman and that indicates we are in the land of the munchkins and therefore a long distance from glinda the good  what shall we do asked the boy turning to their guide  i don’t know replied the scarecrow frankly if we were at the emerald city we could then move directly southward and so reach our destination but we dare not go to the emerald city and the gump is probably carrying us further in the wrong direction with every flop of its wings  then the woggle-bug must swallow another pill said tip decidedly and wish us headed in the right direction  very well returned the highly magnified one i’m willing  but when the scarecrow searched in his pocket for the pepper-box containing the two silver wishing pills it was not to be found filled with anxiety the voyagers hunted throughout every inch of the thing for the precious box but it had disappeared entirely  and still the gump flew onward carrying them they knew not where  i must have left the pepper-box in the jackdaws’ nest said the scarecrow at length  it is a great misfortune the tin woodman declared but we are no worse off than before we discovered the wishing pills  we are better off replied tip for the one pill we used has enabled us to escape from that horrible nest  yet the loss of the other two is serious and i deserve a good scolding for my carelessness the scarecrow rejoined penitently for in such an unusual party as this accidents are liable to happen any moment and even now we may be approaching a new danger  no one dared contradict this and a dismal silence ensued  the gump flew steadily on  suddenly tip uttered an exclamation of surprise we must have reached the south country he cried for below us everything is red  immediately they all leaned over the backs of the sofas to look—all except jack who was too careful of his pumpkin head to risk its slipping off his neck sure enough the red houses and fences and trees indicated they were within the domain of glinda the good and presently as they glided rapidly on the tin woodman recognized the roads and buildings they passed and altered slightly the flight of the gump so that they might reach the palace of the celebrated sorceress  [illustration  image264]  good cried the scarecrow delightedly we do not need the lost wishing pills now for we have arrived at our destination  gradually the thing sank lower and nearer to the ground until at length it came to rest within the beautiful gardens of glinda settling upon a velvety green lawn close by a fountain which sent sprays of flashing gems instead of water high into the air whence they fell with a soft tinkling sound into the carved marble basin placed to receive them  everything was very gorgeous in glinda’s gardens and while our voyagers gazed about with admiring eyes a company of soldiers silently appeared and surrounded them but these soldiers of the great sorceress were entirely different from those of jinjur’s army of revolt although they were likewise girls for glinda’s soldiers wore neat uniforms and bore swords and spears and they marched with a skill and precision that proved them well trained in the arts of war  the captain commanding this troop—which was glinda’s private body guard—recognized the scarecrow and the tin woodman at once and greeted them with respectful salutations  good day said the scarecrow gallantly removing his hat while the woodman gave a soldierly salute we have come to request an audience with your fair ruler  glinda is now within her palace awaiting you returned the captain for she saw you coming long before you arrived  that is strange said tip wondering  not at all answered the scarecrow for glinda the good is a mighty sorceress and nothing that goes on in the land of oz escapes her notice i suppose she knows why we came as well as we do ourselves  then what was the use of our coming asked jack stupidly  to prove you are a pumpkinhead retorted the scarecrow but if the sorceress expects us we must not keep her waiting  so they all clambered out of the sofas and followed the captain toward the palace—even the saw-horse taking his place in the queer procession  upon her throne of finely wrought gold sat glinda and she could scarcely repress a smile as her peculiar visitors entered and bowed before her both the scarecrow and the tin woodman she knew and liked but the awkward pumpkinhead and highly magnified woggle-bug were creatures she had never seen before and they seemed even more curious than the others as for the saw-horse he looked to be nothing more than an animated chunk of wood and he bowed so stiffly that his head bumped against the floor causing a ripple of laughter among the soldiers in which glinda frankly joined  [illustration  image266]  i beg to announce to your glorious highness began the scarecrow in a solemn voice that my emerald city has been overrun by a crowd of impudent girls with knitting-needles who have enslaved all the men robbed the streets and public buildings of all their emerald jewels and usurped my throne  i know it said glinda  they also threatened to destroy me as well as all the good friends and allies you see before you continued the scarecrow and had we not managed to escape their clutches our days would long since have ended  i know it repeated glinda  therefore i have come to beg your assistance resumed the scarecrow for i believe you are always glad to succor the unfortunate and oppressed  that is true replied the sorceress slowly but the emerald city is now ruled by general jinjur w queen what right have i to oppose her  why she stole the throne from me said the scarecrow  and how came you to possess the throne asked glinda  i got it from the wizard of oz and by the choice of the people returned the scarecrow uneasy at such questioning  and where did the wizard get it she continued gravely  i am told he took it from pastoria the former king said the scarecrow becoming confused under the intent look of the sorceress  then declared glinda the throne of the emerald city belongs neither to you nor to jinjur but to this pastoria from whom the wizard usurped it  that is true acknowledged the scarecrow humbly but pastoria is now dead and gone and some one must rule in his place  pastoria had a daughter who is the rightful heir to the throne of the emerald city did you know that questioned the sorceress  no replied the scarecrow but if the girl still lives i will not stand in her way it will satisfy me as well to have jinjur turned out as an impostor as to regain the throne myself in fact it isn’t much fun to be king especially if one has good brains i have known for some time that i am fitted to occupy a far more exalted position but where is the girl who owns the throne and what is her name  her name is ozma answered glinda but where she is i have tried in vain to discover for the wizard of oz when he stole the throne from ozma’s father hid the girl in some secret place and by means of a magical trick with which i am not familiar he also managed to prevent her being discovered—even by so experienced a sorceress as myself  that is strange interrupted the woggle-bug pompously i have been informed that the wonderful wizard of oz was nothing more than a humbug  nonsense exclaimed the scarecrow much provoked by this speech didn’t he give me a wonderful set of brains  there’s no humbug about my heart announced the tin woodman glaring indignantly at the woggle-bug  perhaps i was misinformed stammered the insect shrinking back i never knew the wizard personally  well we did retorted the scarecrow and he was a very great wizard i assure you it is true he was guilty of some slight impostures but unless he was a great wizard how—let me ask—could he have hidden this girl ozma so securely that no one can find her  i—i give it up replied the woggle-bug meekly  that is the most sensible speech you’ve made said the tin woodman  i must really make another effort to discover where this girl is hidden resumed the sorceress thoughtfully i have in my library a book in which is inscribed every action of the wizard while he was in our land of oz—or at least every action that could be observed by my spies this book i will read carefully tonight and try to single out the acts that may guide us in discovering the lost ozma in the meantime pray amuse yourselves in my palace and command my servants as if they were your own i will grant you another audience tomorrow  [illustration  image271]  with this gracious speech glinda dismissed the adventurers and they wandered away through the beautiful gardens where they passed several hours enjoying all the delightful things with which the queen of the southland had surrounded her royal palace  on the following morning they again appeared before glinda who said to them   i have searched carefully through the records of the wizard’s actions and among them i can find but three that appear to have been suspicious he ate beans with a knife made three secret visits to old mombi and limped slightly on his left foot  ah that last is certainly suspicious exclaimed the pumpkinhead  not necessarily said the scarecrow he may have had corns now it seems to me his eating beans with a knife is more suspicious  perhaps it is a polite custom in omaha from which great country the wizard originally came suggested the tin woodman  it may be admitted the scarecrow  but why asked glinda did he make three secret visits to old mombi  ah why indeed echoed the woggle-bug impressively  we know that the wizard taught the old woman many of his tricks of magic continued glinda and this he would not have done had she not assisted him in some way so we may suspect with good reason that mombi aided him to hide the girl ozma who was the real heir to the throne of the emerald city and a constant danger to the usurper for if the people knew that she lived they would quickly make her their queen and restore her to her rightful position  an able argument cried the scarecrow i have no doubt that mombi was mixed up in this wicked business but how does that knowledge help us  we must find mombi replied glinda and force her to tell where the girl is hidden  mombi is now with queen jinjur in the emerald city said tip it was she who threw so many obstacles in our pathway and made jinjur threaten to destroy my friends and give me back into the old witch’s power  then decided glinda i will march with my army to the emerald city and take mombi prisoner after that we can perhaps force her to tell the truth about ozma  she is a terrible old woman remarked tip with a shudder at the thought of mombi’s black kettle and obstinate too  i am quite obstinate myself returned the sorceress with a sweet smile so i do not fear mombi in the least today i will make all necessary preparations and we will march upon the emerald city at daybreak tomorrow  [illustration  image275]  [illustration  image276]  [illustration  image277]     the tin-woodman plucks a rose   the army of glinda the good looked very grand and imposing when it assembled at daybreak before the palace gates the uniforms of the girl soldiers were pretty and of gay colors and their silver-tipped spears were bright and glistening the long shafts being inlaid with mother-of-pearl all the officers wore sharp gleaming swords and shields edged with peacock-feathers and it really seemed that no foe could by any possibility defeat such a brilliant army  the sorceress rode in a beautiful palanquin which was like the body of a coach having doors and windows with silken curtains but instead of wheels which a coach has the palanquin rested upon two long horizontal bars which were borne upon the shoulders of twelve servants  the scarecrow and his comrades decided to ride in the gump in order to keep up with the swift march of the army so as soon as glinda had started and her soldiers had marched away to the inspiring strains of music played by the royal band our friends climbed into the sofas and followed the gump flew along slowly at a point directly over the palanquin in which rode the sorceress  [illustration  image278]  be careful said the tin woodman to the scarecrow who was leaning far over the side to look at the army below you might fall  it wouldn’t matter remarked the educated woggle-bug he can’t get broke so long as he is stuffed with money  didn’t i ask you began tip in a reproachful voice  you did said the woggle-bug promptly and i beg your pardon i will really try to restrain myself  you’d better declared the boy that is if you wish to travel in our company  ah i couldn’t bear to part with you now murmured the insect feelingly so tip let the subject drop  the army moved steadily on but night had fallen before they came to the walls of the emerald city by the dim light of the new moon however glinda’s forces silently surrounded the city and pitched their tents of scarlet silk upon the greensward the tent of the sorceress was larger than the others and was composed of pure white silk with scarlet banners flying above it a tent was also pitched for the scarecrow’s party and when these preparations had been made with military precision and quickness the army retired to rest  great was the amazement of queen jinjur next morning when her soldiers came running to inform her of the vast army surrounding them she at once climbed to a high tower of the royal palace and saw banners waving in every direction and the great white tent of glinda standing directly before the gates  we are surely lost cried jinjur in despair for how can our knitting-needles avail against the long spears and terrible swords of our foes  the best thing we can do said one of the girls is to surrender as quickly as possible before we get hurt  not so returned jinjur more bravely the enemy is still outside the walls so we must try to gain time by engaging them in parley go you with a flag of truce to glinda and ask her why she has dared to invade my dominions and what are her demands  so the girl passed through the gates bearing a white flag to show she was on a mission of peace and came to glinda’s tent tell your queen said the sorceress to the girl that she must deliver up to me old mombi to be my prisoner if this is done i will not molest her farther  [illustration  image280]  now when this message was delivered to the queen it filled her with dismay for mombi was her chief counsellor and jinjur was terribly afraid of the old hag but she sent for mombi and told her what glinda had said  i see trouble ahead for all of us muttered the old witch after glancing into a magic mirror she carried in her pocket but we may even yet escape by deceiving this sorceress clever as she thinks herself  don’t you think it will be safer for me to deliver you into her hands asked jinjur nervously  if you do it will cost you the throne of the emerald city answered the witch positively but if you will let me have my own way i can save us both very easily  then do as you please replied jinjur for it is so aristocratic to be a queen that i do not wish to be obliged to return home again to make beds and wash dishes for my mother  so mombi called jellia jamb to her and performed a certain magical rite with which she was familiar as a result of the enchantment jellia took on the form and features of mombi while the old witch grew to resemble the girl so closely that it seemed impossible anyone could guess the deception  now said old mombi to the queen let your soldiers deliver up this girl to glinda she will think she has the real mombi in her power and so will return immediately to her own country in the south  [illustration  image282]  therefore jellia hobbling along like an aged woman was led from the city gates and taken before glinda  here is the person you demanded said one of the guards and our queen now begs you will go away as you promised and leave us in peace  that i will surely do replied glinda much pleased if this is really the person she seems to be  it is certainly old mombi said the guard who believed she was speaking the truth and then jinjur’s soldiers returned within the city’s gates  the sorceress quickly summoned the scarecrow and his friends to her tent and began to question the supposed mombi about the lost girl ozma but jellia knew nothing at all of this affair and presently she grew so nervous under the questioning that she gave way and began to weep to glinda’s great astonishment  here is some foolish trickery said the sorceress her eyes flashing with anger this is not mombi at all but some other person who has been made to resemble her tell me she demanded turning to the trembling girl what is your name  this jellia dared not tell having been threatened with death by the witch if she confessed the fraud but glinda sweet and fair though she was understood magic better than any other person in the land of oz so by uttering a few potent words and making a peculiar gesture she quickly transformed the girl into her proper shape while at the same time old mombi far away in jinjur’s palace suddenly resumed her own crooked form and evil features  why it’s jellia jamb cried the scarecrow recognizing in the girl one of his old friends  it’s our interpreter said the pumpkinhead smiling pleasantly  [illustration  image284]  then jellia was forced to tell of the trick mombi had played and she also begged glinda’s protection which the sorceress readily granted but glinda was now really angry and sent word to jinjur that the fraud was discovered and she must deliver up the real mombi or suffer terrible consequences jinjur was prepared for this message for the witch well understood when her natural form was thrust upon her that glinda had discovered her trickery but the wicked old creature had already thought up a new deception and had made jinjur promise to carry it out so the queen said to glinda’s messenger   tell your mistress that i cannot find mombi anywhere but that glinda is welcome to enter the city and search herself for the old woman she may also bring her friends with her if she likes but if she does not find mombi by sundown the sorceress must promise to go away peaceably and bother us no more  glinda agreed to these terms well knowing that mombi was somewhere within the city walls so jinjur caused the gates to be thrown open and glinda marched in at the head of a company of soldiers followed by the scarecrow and the tin woodman while jack pumpkinhead rode astride the saw-horse and the educated highly magnified woggle-bug sauntered behind in a dignified manner tip walked by the side of the sorceress for glinda had conceived a great liking for the boy  of course old mombi had no intention of being found by glinda so while her enemies were marching up the street the witch transformed herself into a red rose growing upon a bush in the garden of the palace it was a clever idea and a trick glinda did not suspect so several precious hours were spent in a vain search for mombi  as sundown approached the sorceress realized she had been defeated by the superior cunning of the aged witch so she gave the command to her people to march out of the city and back to their tents  the scarecrow and his comrades happened to be searching in the garden of the palace just then and they turned with disappointment to obey glinda’s command but before they left the garden the tin woodman who was fond of flowers chanced to espy a big red rose growing upon a bush so he plucked the flower and fastened it securely in the tin buttonhole of his tin bosom  [illustration  image285]  as he did this he fancied he heard a low moan proceed from the rose but he paid no attention to the sound and mombi was thus carried out of the city and into glinda’s camp without anyone having a suspicion that they had succeeded in their quest  [illustration  image288]  [illustration  image289]     the transformation of old mombi   the witch was at first frightened at finding herself captured by the enemy but soon she decided that she was exactly as safe in the tin woodman’s button-hole as growing upon the bush for no one knew the rose and mombi to be one and now that she was without the gates of the city her chances of escaping altogether from glinda were much improved  but there is no hurry thought mombi i will wait awhile and enjoy the humiliation of this sorceress when she finds i have outwitted her so throughout the night the rose lay quietly on the woodman’s bosom and in the morning when glinda summoned our friends to a consultation nick chopper carried his pretty flower with him to the white silk tent  for some reason said glinda we have failed to find this cunning old mombi so i fear our expedition will prove a failure and for that i am sorry because without our assistance little ozma will never be rescued and restored to her rightful position as queen of the emerald city  do not let us give up so easily said the pumpkinhead let us do something else  something else must really be done replied glinda with a smile yet i cannot understand how i have been defeated so easily by an old witch who knows far less of magic than i do myself  while we are on the ground i believe it would be wise for us to conquer the emerald city for princess ozma and find the girl afterward said the scarecrow and while the girl remains hidden i will gladly rule in her place for i understand the business of ruling much better than jinjur does  but i have promised not to molest jinjur objected glinda  [illustration  image290]  suppose you all return with me to my kingdom—or empire rather said the tin woodman politely including the entire party in a royal wave of his arm it will give me great pleasure to entertain you in my castle where there is room enough and to spare and if any of you wish to be nickel-plated my valet will do it free of all expense  while the woodman was speaking glinda’s eyes had been noting the rose in his button-hole and now she imagined she saw the big red leaves of the flower tremble slightly this quickly aroused her suspicions and in a moment more the sorceress had decided that the seeming rose was nothing else than a transformation of old mombi at the same instant mombi knew she was discovered and must quickly plan an escape and as transformations were easy to her she immediately took the form of a shadow and glided along the wall of the tent toward the entrance thinking thus to disappear  but glinda had not only equal cunning but far more experience than the witch so the sorceress reached the opening of the tent before the shadow and with a wave of her hand closed the entrance so securely that mombi could not find a crack big enough to creep through the scarecrow and his friends were greatly surprised at glinda’s actions for none of them had noted the shadow but the sorceress said to them   remain perfectly quiet all of you for the old witch is even now with us in this tent and i hope to capture her  these words so alarmed mombi that she quickly transformed herself from a shadow to a black ant in which shape she crawled along the ground seeking a crack or crevice in which to hide her tiny body  [illustration  image293]  fortunately the ground where the tent had been pitched being just before the city gates was hard and smooth and while the ant still crawled about glinda discovered it and ran quickly forward to effect its capture but just as her hand was descending the witch now fairly frantic with fear made her last transformation and in the form of a huge griffin sprang through the wall of the tent—tearing the silk asunder in her rush—and in a moment had darted away with the speed of a whirlwind  glinda did not hesitate to follow she sprang upon the back of the saw-horse and cried   now you shall prove that you have a right to be alive run—run—run  the saw-horse ran like a flash he followed the griffin his wooden legs moving so fast that they twinkled like the rays of a star before our friends could recover from their surprise both the griffin and the saw-horse had dashed out of sight  come let us follow cried the scarecrow  they ran to the place where the gump was lying and quickly tumbled aboard  fly commanded tip eagerly  where to asked the gump in its calm voice  i don’t know returned tip who was very nervous at the delay but if you will mount into the air i think we can discover which way glinda has gone  very well returned the gump quietly and it spread its great wings and mounted high into the air  [illustration  image295]  far away across the meadows they could now see two tiny specks speeding one after the other and they knew these specks must be the griffin and the saw-horse so tip called the gump’s attention to them and bade the creature try to overtake the witch and the sorceress but swift as was the gump’s flight the pursued and pursuer moved more swiftly yet and within a few moments were blotted out against the dim horizon  let us continue to follow them nevertheless said the scarecrow for the land of oz is of small extent and sooner or later they must both come to a halt  old mombi had thought herself very wise to choose the form of a griffin for its legs were exceedingly fleet and its strength more enduring than that of other animals but she had not reckoned on the untiring energy of the saw-horse whose wooden limbs could run for days without slacking their speed therefore after an hour’s hard running the griffin’s breath began to fail and it panted and gasped painfully and moved more slowly than before then it reached the edge of the desert and began racing across the deep sands but its tired feet sank far into the sand and in a few minutes the griffin fell forward completely exhausted and lay still upon the desert waste  glinda came up a moment later riding the still vigorous saw-horse and having unwound a slender golden thread from her girdle the sorceress threw it over the head of the panting and helpless griffin and so destroyed the magical power of mombi’s transformation  for the animal with one fierce shudder disappeared from view while in its place was discovered the form of the old witch glaring savagely at the serene and beautiful face of the sorceress  [illustration  image297]  [illustration  image298]  [illustration  image299]     princess ozma of oz   you are my prisoner and it is useless for you to struggle any longer said glinda in her soft sweet voice lie still a moment and rest yourself and then i will carry you back to my tent  why do you seek me asked mombi still scarce able to speak plainly for lack of breath what have i done to you to be so persecuted  you have done nothing to me answered the gentle sorceress but i suspect you have been guilty of several wicked actions and if i find it is true that you have so abused your knowledge of magic i intend to punish you severely  i defy you croaked the old hag you dare not harm me  just then the gump flew up to them and alighted upon the desert sands beside glinda our friends were delighted to find that mombi had finally been captured and after a hurried consultation it was decided they should all return to the camp in the gump so the saw-horse was tossed aboard and then glinda still holding an end of the golden thread that was around mombi’s neck forced her prisoner to climb into the sofas the others now followed and tip gave the word to the gump to return  the journey was made in safety mombi sitting in her place with a grim and sullen air for the old hag was absolutely helpless so long as the magical thread encircled her throat the army hailed glinda’s return with loud cheers and the party of friends soon gathered again in the royal tent which had been neatly repaired during their absence  now said the sorceress to mombi i want you to tell us why the wonderful wizard of oz paid you three visits and what became of the child ozma which so curiously disappeared  the witch looked at glinda defiantly but said not a word  answer me cried the sorceress  but still mombi remained silent  perhaps she doesn’t know remarked jack  i beg you will keep quiet said tip you might spoil everything with your foolishness  very well dear father returned the pumpkinhead meekly  how glad i am to be a woggle-bug murmured the highly magnified insect softly no one can expect wisdom to flow from a pumpkin  well said the scarecrow what shall we do to make mombi speak unless she tells us what we wish to know her capture will do us no good at all  suppose we try kindness suggested the tin woodman i’ve heard that anyone can be conquered with kindness no matter how ugly they may be  at this the witch turned to glare upon him so horribly that the tin woodman shrank back abashed  glinda had been carefully considering what to do and now she turned to mombi and said   you will gain nothing i assure you by thus defying us for i am determined to learn the truth about the girl ozma and unless you tell me all that you know i will certainly put you to death  oh no don’t do that exclaimed the tin woodman it would be an awful thing to kill anyone—even old mombi  but it is merely a threat returned glinda i shall not put mombi to death because she will prefer to tell me the truth  oh i see said the tin man much relieved  suppose i tell you all that you wish to know said mombi speaking so suddenly that she startled them all what will you do with me then  in that case replied glinda i shall merely ask you to drink a powerful draught which will cause you to forget all the magic you have ever learned  then i would become a helpless old woman  but you would be alive suggested the pumpkinhead consolingly  do try to keep silent said tip nervously  i’ll try responded jack but you will admit that it’s a good thing to be alive  especially if one happens to be thoroughly educated added the woggle-bug nodding approval  you may make your choice glinda said to old mombi between death if you remain silent and the loss of your magical powers if you tell me the truth but i think you will prefer to live  mombi cast an uneasy glance at the sorceress and saw that she was in earnest and not to be trifled with so she replied slowly   i will answer your questions  that is what i expected said glinda pleasantly you have chosen wisely i assure you  she then motioned to one of her captains who brought her a beautiful golden casket from this the sorceress drew an immense white pearl attached to a slender chain which she placed around her neck in such a way that the pearl rested upon her bosom directly over her heart  now said she i will ask my first question  why did the wizard pay you three visits  because i would not come to him answered mombi  that is no answer said glinda sternly tell me the truth  well returned mombi with downcast eyes he visited me to learn the way i make tea-biscuits  look up commanded the sorceress  mombi obeyed  what is the color of my pearl demanded glinda  why—it is black replied the old witch in a tone of wonder  then you have told me a falsehood cried glinda angrily only when the truth is spoken will my magic pearl remain a pure white in color  mombi now saw how useless it was to try to deceive the sorceress so she said meanwhile scowling at her defeat   the wizard brought to me the girl ozma who was then no more than a baby and begged me to conceal the child  that is what i thought declared glinda calmly what did he give you for thus serving him  he taught me all the magical tricks he knew some were good tricks and some were only frauds but i have remained faithful to my promise  what did you do with the girl asked glinda and at this question everyone bent forward and listened eagerly for the reply  i enchanted her answered mombi  in what way  i transformed her into—into—  into what demanded glinda as the witch hesitated  into a boy said mombi in a low tone  a boy echoed every voice and then because they knew that this old woman had reared tip from childhood all eyes were turned to where the boy stood  yes said the old witch nodding her head that is the princess ozma—the child brought to me by the wizard who stole her father’s throne that is the rightful ruler of the emerald city and she pointed her long bony finger straight at the boy  i cried tip in amazement why i’m no princess ozma—i’m not a girl  glinda smiled and going to tip she took his small brown hand within her dainty white one  you are not a girl just now said she gently because mombi transformed you into a boy but you were born a girl and also a princess so you must resume your proper form that you may become queen of the emerald city  oh let jinjur be the queen exclaimed tip ready to cry i want to stay a boy and travel with the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the woggle-bug and jack—yes and my friend the saw-horse—and the gump i don’t want to be a girl  never mind old chap said the tin woodman soothingly it don’t hurt to be a girl i’m told and we will all remain your faithful friends just the same and to be honest with you i’ve always considered girls nicer than boys  they’re just as nice anyway added the scarecrow patting tip affectionately upon the head  and they are equally good students proclaimed the woggle-bug i should like to become your tutor when you are transformed into a girl again  but—see here said jack pumpkinhead with a gasp  if you become a girl you can’t be my dear father any more  no answered tip laughing in spite of his anxiety and i shall not be sorry to escape the relationship then he added hesitatingly as he turned to glinda  i might try it for awhile-just to see how it seems you know but if i don’t like being a girl you must promise to change me into a boy again  really said the sorceress that is beyond my magic i never deal in transformations for they are not honest and no respectable sorceress likes to make things appear to be what they are not only unscrupulous witches use the art and therefore i must ask mombi to effect your release from her charm and restore you to your proper form it will be the last opportunity she will have to practice magic  now that the truth about princes ozma had been discovered mombi did not care what became of tip but she feared glinda’s anger and the boy generously promised to provide for mombi in her old age if he became the ruler of the emerald city so the witch consented to effect the transformation and preparations for the event were at once made  glinda ordered her own royal couch to be placed in the center of the tent it was piled high with cushions covered with rose-colored silk and from a golden railing above hung many folds of pink gossamer completely concealing the interior of the couch  the first act of the witch was to make the boy drink a potion which quickly sent him into a deep and dreamless sleep then the tin woodman and the woggle-bug bore him gently to the couch placed him upon the soft cushions and drew the gossamer hangings to shut him from all earthly view  the witch squatted upon the ground and kindled a tiny fire of dried herbs which she drew from her bosom when the blaze shot up and burned clearly old mombi scattered a handful of magical powder over the fire which straightway gave off a rich violet vapor filling all the tent with its fragrance and forcing the saw-horse to sneeze—although he had been warned to keep quiet  then while the others watched her curiously the hag chanted a rhythmical verse in words which no one understood and bent her lean body seven times back and forth over the fire and now the incantation seemed complete for the witch stood upright and cried the one word yeowa in a loud voice  the vapor floated away the atmosphere became clear again a whiff of fresh air filled the tent and the pink curtains of the couch trembled slightly as if stirred from within  glinda walked to the canopy and parted the silken hangings then she bent over the cushions reached out her hand and from the couch arose the form of a young girl fresh and beautiful as a may morning her eyes sparkled as two diamonds and her lips were tinted like a tourmaline all adown her back floated tresses of ruddy gold with a slender jeweled circlet confining them at the brow her robes of silken gauze floated around her like a cloud and dainty satin slippers shod her feet  at this exquisite vision tip’s old comrades stared in wonder for the space of a full minute and then every head bent low in honest admiration of the lovely princess ozma the girl herself cast one look into glinda’s bright face which glowed with pleasure and satisfaction and then turned upon the others speaking the words with sweet diffidence she said   i hope none of you will care less for me than you did before i’m just the same tip you know only—only—  only you’re different said the pumpkinhead and everyone thought it was the wisest speech he had ever made  [illustration  image303]     the riches of content   when the wonderful tidings reached the ears of queen jinjur—how mombi the witch had been captured how she had confessed her crime to glinda and how the long-lost princess ozma had been discovered in no less a personage than the boy tip—she wept real tears of grief and despair  to think she moaned that after having ruled as queen and lived in a palace i must go back to scrubbing floors and churning butter again it is too horrible to think of i will never consent  so when her soldiers who spent most of their time making fudge in the palace kitchens counseled jinjur to resist she listened to their foolish prattle and sent a sharp defiance to glinda the good and the princess ozma the result was a declaration of war and the very next day glinda marched upon the emerald city with pennants flying and bands playing and a forest of shining spears sparkling brightly beneath the sun’s rays  but when it came to the walls this brave assembly made a sudden halt for jinjur had closed and barred every gateway and the walls of the emerald city were builded high and thick with many blocks of green marble finding her advance thus baffled glinda bent her brows in deep thought while the woggle-bug said in his most positive tone   we must lay siege to the city and starve it into submission it is the only thing we can do  not so answered the scarecrow we still have the gump and the gump can still fly  the sorceress turned quickly at this speech and her face now wore a bright smile  you are right she exclaimed and certainly have reason to be proud of your brains let us go to the gump at once  so they passed through the ranks of the army until they came to the place near the scarecrow’s tent where the gump lay glinda and princess ozma mounted first and sat upon the sofas then the scarecrow and his friends climbed aboard and still there was room for a captain and three soldiers which glinda considered sufficient for a guard  [illustration  image305]  now at a word from the princess the queer thing they had called the gump flopped its palm-leaf wings and rose into the air carrying the party of adventurers high above the walls they hovered over the palace and soon perceived jinjur reclining in a hammock in the courtyard where she was comfortably reading a novel with a green cover and eating green chocolates confident that the walls would protect her from her enemies obeying a quick command the gump alighted safely in this very courtyard and before jinjur had time to do more than scream the captain and three soldiers leaped out and made the former queen a prisoner locking strong chains upon both her wrists  that act really ended the war for the army of revolt submitted as soon as they knew jinjur to be a captive and the captain marched in safety through the streets and up to the gates of the city which she threw wide open then the bands played their most stirring music while glinda’s army marched into the city and heralds proclaimed the conquest of the audacious jinjur and the accession of the beautiful princess ozma to the throne of her royal ancestors  [illustration  image306]  at once the men of the emerald city cast off their aprons and it is said that the women were so tired eating of their husbands’ cooking that they all hailed the conquest of jinjur with joy certain it is that rushing one and all to the kitchens of their houses the good wives prepared so delicious a feast for the weary men that harmony was immediately restored in every family  ozma’s first act was to oblige the army of revolt to return to her every emerald or other gem stolen from the public streets and buildings and so great was the number of precious stones picked from their settings by these vain girls that every one of the royal jewelers worked steadily for more than a month to replace them in their settings  meanwhile the army of revolt was disbanded and the girls sent home to their mothers on promise of good behavior jinjur was likewise released  ozma made the loveliest queen the emerald city had ever known and although she was so young and inexperienced she ruled her people with wisdom and justice for glinda gave her good advice on all occasions and the woggle-bug who was appointed to the important post of public educator was quite helpful to ozma when her royal duties grew perplexing  the girl in her gratitude to the gump for its services offered the creature any reward it might name  then replied the gump please take me to pieces i did not wish to be brought to life and i am greatly ashamed of my conglomerate personality once i was a monarch of the forest as my antlers fully prove but now in my present upholstered condition of servitude i am compelled to fly through the air—my legs being of no use to me whatever therefore i beg to be dispersed  so ozma ordered the gump taken apart the antlered head was again hung over the mantle-piece in the hall and the sofas were untied and placed in the reception parlors the broom tail resumed its accustomed duties in the kitchen and finally the scarecrow replaced all the clotheslines and ropes on the pegs from which he had taken them on the eventful day when the thing was constructed  you might think that was the end of the gump and so it was as a flying-machine but the head over the mantle-piece continued to talk whenever it took a notion to do so and it frequently startled with its abrupt questions the people who waited in the hall for an audience with the queen  the saw-horse being ozma’s personal property was tenderly cared for and often she rode the queer creature along the streets of the emerald city she had its wooden legs shod with gold to keep them from wearing out and the tinkle of these golden shoes upon the pavement always filled the queen’s subjects with awe as they thought upon this evidence of her magical powers  the wonderful wizard was never so wonderful as queen ozma the people said to one another in whispers for he claimed to do many things he could not do whereas our new queen does many things no one would ever expect her to accomplish  jack pumpkinhead remained with ozma to the end of his days and he did not spoil as soon as he had feared although he always remained as stupid as ever the woggle-bug tried to teach him several arts and sciences but jack was so poor a student that any attempt to educate him was soon abandoned  after glinda’s army had marched back home and peace was restored to the emerald city the tin woodman announced his intention to return to his own kingdom of the winkies  it isn’t a very big kingdom said he to ozma but for that very reason it is easier to rule and i have called myself an emperor because i am an absolute monarch and no one interferes in any way with my conduct of public or personal affairs when i get home i shall have a new coat of nickel plate for i have become somewhat marred and scratched lately and then i shall be glad to have you pay me a visit  thank you replied ozma some day i may accept the invitation but what is to become of the scarecrow  i shall return with my friend the tin woodman said the stuffed one seriously we have decided never to be parted in the future  [illustration  image309]  and i have made the scarecrow my royal treasurer explained the tin woodman for it has occurred to me that it is a good thing to have a royal treasurer who is made of money what do you think  i think said the little queen smiling that your friend must be the richest man in all the world  i am returned the scarecrow but not on account of my money for i consider brains far superior to money in every way you may have noticed that if one has money without brains he cannot use it to advantage but if one has brains without money they will enable him to live comfortably to the end of his days  at the same time declared the tin woodman you must acknowledge that a good heart is a thing that brains can not create and that money can not buy perhaps after all it is i who am the richest man in all the world  you are both rich my friends said ozma gently and your riches are the only riches worth having—the riches of content  [illustration  image313]  [illustration  image318],The Marvelous Land of Oz,L.Frank Baum

   [illustration  ozma]       to my readers   i know that some of you have been waiting for this story of the tin woodman because many of my correspondents have asked me time and again what ever became of the pretty munchkin girl whom nick chopper was engaged to marry before the wicked witch enchanted his axe and he traded his flesh for tin i too have wondered what became of her but until woot the wanderer interested himself in the matter the tin woodman knew no more than we did however he found her after many thrilling adventures as you will discover when you have read this story  i am delighted at the continued interest of both young and old in the oz stories a learned college professor recently wrote me to ask  for readers of what age are your books intended it puzzled me to answer that properly until i had looked over some of the letters i have received one says  i'm a little boy 5 years old and i just love your oz stories my sister who is writing this for me reads me the oz books but i wish i could read them myself another letter says  i'm a great girl 13 years old so you'll be surprised when i tell you i am not too old yet for the oz stories here's another letter  since i was a young girl i've never missed getting a baum book for christmas i'm married now but am as eager to get and read the oz stories as ever and still another writes  my good wife and i both more than 70 years of age believe that we find more real enjoyment in your oz books than in any other books we read considering these statements i wrote the college professor that my books are intended for all those whose hearts are young no matter what their ages may be  and while on this subject of letters i am reminded that a good many of my correspondents neglect to slip a 3-cent postage-stamp into their letters for the answer you are sending but one letter you know while i get so many hundreds of letters that to prepay postage on all the answers to them would be no small burden to me  i think i am justified in promising that there will be some astonishing revelations about the magic of oz in my book for 1919      always your loving and grateful friend

285     [illustration  woot in court dress]     woot the wanderer    chapter 1   the tin woodman sat on his glittering tin throne in the handsome tin hall of his splendid tin castle in the winkie country of the land of oz beside him in a chair of woven straw sat his best friend the scarecrow of oz at times they spoke to one another of curious things they had seen and strange adventures they had known since first they two had met and become comrades but at times they were silent for these things had been talked over many times between them and they found themselves contented in merely being together speaking now and then a brief sentence to prove they were wide awake and attentive but then these two quaint persons never slept why should they sleep when they never tired  and now as the brilliant sun sank low over the winkie country of oz tinting the glistening tin towers and tin minarets of the tin castle with glorious sunset hues there approached along a winding pathway woot the wanderer who met at the castle entrance a winkie servant  the servants of the tin woodman all wore tin helmets and tin breastplates and uniforms covered with tiny tin discs sewed closely together on silver cloth so that their bodies sparkled as beautifully as did the tin castle and almost as beautifully as did the tin woodman himself  woot the wanderer looked at the man servant all bright and glittering and at the magnificent castle all bright and glittering and as he looked his eyes grew big with wonder for woot was not very big and not very old and wanderer though he was this proved the most gorgeous sight that had ever met his boyish gaze  who lives here he asked  the emperor of the winkies who is the famous tin woodman of oz replied the servant who had been trained to treat all strangers with courtesy  a tin woodman how queer exclaimed the little wanderer  well perhaps our emperor is queer admitted the servant but he is a kind master and as honest and true as good tin can make him so we who gladly serve him are apt to forget that he is not like other people  may i see him asked woot the wanderer after a moment's thought  if it please you to wait a moment i will go and ask him said the servant and then he went into the hall where the tin woodman sat with his friend the scarecrow both were glad to learn that a stranger had arrived at the castle for this would give them something new to talk about so the servant was asked to admit the boy at once  by the time woot the wanderer had passed through the grand corridors all lined with ornamental tin and under stately tin archways and through the many tin rooms all set with beautiful tin furniture his eyes had grown bigger than ever and his whole little body thrilled with amazement but astonished though he was he was able to make a polite bow before the throne and to say in a respectful voice  i salute your illustrious majesty and offer you my humble services  very good answered the tin woodman in his accustomed cheerful manner tell me who you are and whence you come  i am known as woot the wanderer answered the boy and i have come through many travels and by roundabout ways from my former home in a far corner of the gillikin country of oz  to wander from one's home remarked the scarecrow is to encounter dangers and hardships especially if one is made of meat and bone had you no friends in that corner of the gillikin country was it not homelike and comfortable  to hear a man stuffed with straw speak and speak so well quite startled woot and perhaps he stared a bit rudely at the scarecrow but after a moment he replied   i had home and friends your honorable strawness but they were so quiet and happy and comfortable that i found them dismally stupid nothing in that corner of oz interested me but i believed that in other parts of the country i would find strange people and see new sights and so i set out upon my wandering journey i have been a wanderer for nearly a full year and now my wanderings have brought me to this splendid castle  i suppose said the tin woodman that in this year you have seen so much that you have become very wise  no replied woot thoughtfully i am not at all wise i beg to assure your majesty the more i wander the less i find that i know for in the land of oz much wisdom and many things may be learned  to learn is simple don't you ask questions inquired the scarecrow  yes i ask as many questions as i dare but some people refuse to answer questions  that is not kind of them declared the tin woodman if one does not ask for information he seldom receives it so i for my part make it a rule to answer any civil question that is asked me  so do i added the scarecrow nodding  i am glad to hear this said the wanderer for it makes me bold to ask for something to eat    bless the boy cried the emperor of the winkies how careless of me not to remember that wanderers are usually hungry i will have food brought you at once  saying this he blew upon a tin whistle that was suspended from his tin neck and at the summons a servant appeared and bowed low the tin woodman ordered food for the stranger and in a few minutes the servant brought in a tin tray heaped with a choice array of good things to eat all neatly displayed on tin dishes that were polished till they shone like mirrors the tray was set upon a tin table drawn before the throne and the servant placed a tin chair before the table for the boy to seat himself  eat friend wanderer said the emperor cordially and i trust the feast will be to your liking i myself do not eat being made in such manner that i require no food to keep me alive neither does my friend the scarecrow but all my winkie people eat being formed of flesh as you are and so my tin cupboard is never bare and strangers are always welcome to whatever it contains  the boy ate in silence for a time being really hungry but after his appetite was somewhat satisfied he said   how happened your majesty to be made of tin and still be alive  that replied the tin man is a long story    the longer the better said the boy won't you please tell me the story  if you desire it promised the tin woodman leaning back in his tin throne and crossing his tin legs i haven't related my history in a long while because everyone here knows it nearly as well as i do but you being a stranger are no doubt curious to learn how i became so beautiful and prosperous so i will recite for your benefit my strange adventures  thank you said woot the wanderer still eating  i was not always made of tin began the emperor for in the beginning i was a man of flesh and bone and blood and lived in the munchkin country of oz there i was by trade a woodchopper and contributed my share to the comfort of the oz people by chopping up the trees of the forest to make firewood with which the women would cook their meals while the children warmed themselves about the fires for my home i had a little hut by the edge of the forest and my life was one of much content until i fell in love with a beautiful munchkin girl who lived not far away  what was the munchkin girl's name asked woot  nimmie amee this girl so fair that the sunsets blushed when their rays fell upon her lived with a powerful witch who wore silver shoes and who had made the poor child her slave nimmie amee was obliged to work from morning till night for the old witch of the east scrubbing and sweeping her hut and cooking her meals and washing her dishes she had to cut firewood too until i found her one day in the forest and fell in love with her after that i always brought plenty of firewood to nimmie amee and we became very friendly finally i asked her to marry me and she agreed to do so but the witch happened to overhear our conversation and it made her very angry for she did not wish her slave to be taken away from her the witch commanded me never to come near nimmie amee again but i told her i was my own master and would do as i pleased not realizing that this was a careless way to speak to a witch  the next day as i was cutting wood in the forest the cruel witch enchanted my axe so that it slipped and cut off my right leg  how dreadful cried woot the wanderer  yes it was a seeming misfortune agreed the tin man for a one-legged woodchopper is of little use in his trade but i would not allow the witch to conquer me so easily i knew a very skillful mechanic at the other side of the forest who was my friend so i hopped on one leg to him and asked him to help me he soon made me a new leg out of tin and fastened it cleverly to my meat body it had joints at the knee and at the ankle and was almost as comfortable as the leg i had lost  your friend must have been a wonderful workman exclaimed woot  he was indeed admitted the emperor he was a tinsmith by trade and could make anything out of tin when i returned to nimmie amee the girl was delighted and threw her arms around my neck and kissed me declaring she was proud of me the witch saw the kiss and was more angry than before when i went to work in the forest next day my axe being still enchanted slipped and cut off my other leg again i hopped on my tin leg to my friend the tinsmith who kindly made me another tin leg and fastened it to my body so i returned joyfully to nimmie amee who was much pleased with my glittering legs and promised that when we were wed she would always keep them oiled and polished but the witch was more furious than ever and as soon as i raised my axe to chop it twisted around and cut off one of my arms the tinsmith made me a tin arm and i was not much worried because nimmie amee declared she still loved me       the heart of the tin woodman    chapter 2   the emperor of the winkies paused in his story to reach for an oil-can with which he carefully oiled the joints in his tin throat for his voice had begun to squeak a little woot the wanderer having satisfied his hunger watched this oiling process with much curiosity but begged the tin man to go on with his tale  the witch with the silver shoes hated me for having defied her resumed the emperor his voice now sounding clear as a bell and she insisted that nimmie amee should never marry me therefore she made the enchanted axe cut off my other arm and the tinsmith also replaced that member with tin including these finely-jointed hands that you see me using but alas after that the axe still enchanted by the cruel witch cut my body in two so that i fell to the ground then the witch who was watching from a near-by bush rushed up and seized the axe and chopped my body into several small pieces after which thinking that at last she had destroyed me she ran away laughing in wicked glee  but nimmie amee found me she picked up my arms and legs and head and made a bundle of them and carried them to the tinsmith who set to work and made me a fine body of pure tin when he had joined the arms and legs to the body and set my head in the tin collar i was a much better man than ever for my body could not ache or pain me and i was so beautiful and bright that i had no need of clothing clothing is always a nuisance because it soils and tears and has to be replaced but my tin body only needs to be oiled and polished    nimmie amee still declared she would marry me as she still loved me in spite of the witch's evil deeds the girl declared i would make the brightest husband in all the world which was quite true however the wicked witch was not yet defeated when i returned to my work the axe slipped and cut off my head which was the only meat part of me then remaining moreover the old woman grabbed up my severed head and carried it away with her and hid it but nimmie amee came into the forest and found me wandering around helplessly because i could not see where to go and she led me to my friend the tinsmith the faithful fellow at once set to work to make me a tin head and he had just completed it when nimmie amee came running up with my old head which she had stolen from the witch but on reflection i considered the tin head far superior to the meat one i am wearing it yet so you can see its beauty and grace of outline and the girl agreed with me that a man all made of tin was far more perfect than one formed of different materials the tinsmith was as proud of his workmanship as i was and for three whole days all admired me and praised my beauty  being now completely formed of tin i had no more fear of the wicked witch for she was powerless to injure me nimmie amee said we must be married at once for then she could come to my cottage and live with me and keep me bright and sparkling  'i am sure my dear nick' said the brave and beautiful girl my name was then nick chopper you should be told 'that you will make the best husband any girl could have i shall not be obliged to cook for you for now you do not eat i shall not have to make your bed for tin does not tire or require sleep when we go to a dance you will not get weary before the music stops and say you want to go home all day long while you are chopping wood in the forest i shall be able to amuse myself in my own way a privilege few wives enjoy there is no temper in your new head so you will not get angry with me finally i shall take pride in being the wife of the only live tin woodman in all the world' which shows that nimmie amee was as wise as she was brave and beautiful  i think she was a very nice girl said woot the wanderer but tell me please why were you not killed when you were chopped to pieces  in the land of oz replied the emperor no one can ever be killed a man with a wooden leg or a tin leg is still the same man and as i lost parts of my meat body by degrees i always remained the same person as in the beginning even though in the end i was all tin and no meat  i see said the boy thoughtfully and did you marry nimmie amee  no answered the tin woodman i did not she said she still loved me but i found that i no longer loved her my tin body contained no heart and without a heart no one can love so the wicked witch conquered in the end and when i left the munchkin country of oz the poor girl was still the slave of the witch and had to do her bidding day and night  where did you go asked woot  well i first started out to find a heart so i could love nimmie amee again but hearts are more scarce than one would think one day in a big forest that was strange to me my joints suddenly became rusted because i had forgotten to oil them there i stood unable to move hand or foot and there i continued to stand while days came and went until dorothy and the scarecrow came along and rescued me they oiled my joints and set me free and i've taken good care never to rust again  who was this dorothy questioned the wanderer  a little girl who happened to be in a house when it was carried by a cyclone all the way from kansas to the land of oz when the house fell in the munchkin country it fortunately landed on the wicked witch and smashed her flat it was a big house and i think the witch is under it yet  no said the scarecrow correcting him dorothy says the witch turned to dust and the wind scattered the dust in every direction  well continued the tin woodman after meeting the scarecrow and dorothy i went with them to the emerald city where the wizard of oz gave me a heart but the wizard's stock of hearts was low and he gave me a kind heart instead of a loving heart so that i could not love nimmie amee any more than i did when i was heartless  couldn't the wizard give you a heart that was both kind and loving asked the boy  no that was what i asked for but he said he was so short on hearts just then that there was but one in stock and i could take that or none at all so i accepted it and i must say that for its kind it is a very good heart indeed  it seems to me said woot musingly that the wizard fooled you it can't be a very kind heart you know  why not demanded the emperor  because it was unkind of you to desert the girl who loved you and who had been faithful and true to you when you were in trouble had the heart the wizard gave you been a kind heart you would have gone back home and made the beautiful munchkin girl your wife and then brought her here to be an empress and live in your splendid tin castle  the tin woodman was so surprised at this frank speech that for a time he did nothing but stare hard at the boy wanderer but the scarecrow wagged his stuffed head and said in a positive tone   this boy is right i've often wondered myself why you didn't go back and find that poor munchkin girl  then the tin woodman stared hard at his friend the scarecrow but finally he said in a serious tone of voice   i must admit that never before have i thought of such a thing as finding nimmie amee and making her empress of the winkies but it is surely not too late even now to do this for the girl must still be living in the munchkin country and since this strange wanderer has reminded me of nimmie amee i believe it is my duty to set out and find her surely it is not the girl's fault that i no longer love her and so if i can make her happy it is proper that i should do so and in this way reward her for her faithfulness    quite right my friend agreed the scarecrow  will you accompany me on this errand asked the tin emperor  of course said the scarecrow  and will you take me along pleaded woot the wanderer in an eager voice  to be sure said the tin woodman if you care to join our party it was you who first told me it was my duty to find and marry nimmie amee and i'd like you to know that nick chopper the tin emperor of the winkies is a man who never shirks his duty once it is pointed out to him  it ought to be a pleasure as well as a duty if the girl is so beautiful said woot well pleased with the idea of the adventure  beautiful things may be admired if not loved asserted the tin man flowers are beautiful for instance but we are not inclined to marry them duty on the contrary is a bugle call to action whether you are inclined to act or not in this case i obey the bugle call of duty  when shall we start inquired the scarecrow who was always glad to embark upon a new adventure i don't hear any bugle but when do we go  as soon as we can get ready answered the emperor i'll call my servants at once and order them to make preparations for our journey     roundabout    chapter 3   woot the wanderer slept that night in the tin castle of the emperor of the winkies and found his tin bed quite comfortable early the next morning he rose and took a walk through the gardens where there were tin fountains and beds of curious tin flowers and where tin birds perched upon the branches of tin trees and sang songs that sounded like the notes of tin whistles all these wonders had been made by the clever winkie tinsmiths who wound the birds up every morning so that they would move about and sing  after breakfast the boy went into the throne room where the emperor was having his tin joints carefully oiled by a servant while other servants were stuffing sweet fresh straw into the body of the scarecrow  woot watched this operation with much interest for the scarecrow's body was only a suit of clothes filled with straw the coat was buttoned tight to keep the packed straw from falling out and a rope was tied around the waist to hold it in shape and prevent the straw from sagging down the scarecrow's head was a gunnysack filled with bran on which the eyes nose and mouth had been painted his hands were white cotton gloves stuffed with fine straw woot noticed that even when carefully stuffed and patted into shape the straw man was awkward in his movements and decidedly wobbly on his feet so the boy wondered if the scarecrow would be able to travel with them all the way to the forests of the munchkin country of oz  the preparations made for this important journey were very simple a knapsack was filled with food and given woot the wanderer to carry upon his back for the food was for his use alone the tin woodman shouldered an axe which was sharp and brightly polished and the scarecrow put the emperor's oil-can in his pocket that he might oil his friend's joints should they need it  [illustration  i don't hear any bugle]  who will govern the winkie country during your absence asked the boy  why the country will run itself answered the emperor as a matter of fact my people do not need an emperor for ozma of oz watches over the welfare of all her subjects including the winkies like a good many kings and emperors i have a grand title but very little real power which allows me time to amuse myself in my own way the people of oz have but one law to obey which is  'behave yourself' so it is easy for them to abide by this law and you'll notice they behave very well but it is time for us to be off and i am eager to start because i suppose that that poor munchkin girl is anxiously awaiting my coming  she's waited a long time already seems to me remarked the scarecrow as they left the grounds of the castle and followed a path that led eastward  true replied the tin woodman but i've noticed that the last end of a wait however long it has been is the hardest to endure so i must try to make nimmie amee happy as soon as possible  ah that proves you have a kind heart remarked the scarecrow approvingly  it's too bad he hasn't a loving heart said woot this tin man is going to marry a nice girl through kindness and not because he loves her and somehow that doesn't seem quite right  even so i am not sure it isn't best for the girl said the scarecrow who seemed very intelligent for a straw man for a loving husband is not always kind while a kind husband is sure to make any girl content  nimmie amee will become an empress announced the tin woodman proudly i shall have a tin gown made for her with tin ruffles and tucks on it and she shall have tin slippers and tin earrings and bracelets and wear a tin crown on her head i am sure that will delight nimmie amee for all girls are fond of finery  are we going to the munchkin country by way of the emerald city inquired the scarecrow who looked upon the tin woodman as the leader of the party  i think not was the reply we are engaged upon a rather delicate adventure for we are seeking a girl who fears her former lover has forgotten her it will be rather hard for me you must admit when i confess to nimmie amee that i have come to marry her because it is my duty to do so and therefore the fewer witnesses there are to our meeting the better for both of us after i have found nimmie amee and she has managed to control her joy at our reunion i shall take her to the emerald city and introduce her to ozma and dorothy and to betsy bobbin and tiny trot and all our other friends but if i remember rightly poor nimmie amee has a sharp tongue when angry and she may be a trifle angry with me at first because i have been so long in coming to her  i can understand that said woot gravely but how can we get to that part of the munchkin country where you once lived without passing through the emerald city  why that is easy the tin man assured him  i have a map of oz in my pocket persisted the boy and it shows that the winkie country where we now are is at the west of oz and the munchkin country at the east while directly between them lies the emerald city  true enough but we shall go toward the north first of all into the gillikin country and so pass around the emerald city explained the tin woodman  that may prove a dangerous journey replied the boy i used to live in one of the top corners of the gillikin country near to oogaboo and i have been told that in this northland country are many people whom it is not pleasant to meet i was very careful to avoid them during my journey south  a wanderer should have no fear observed the scarecrow who was wabbling along in a funny haphazard manner but keeping pace with his friends    fear does not make one a coward returned woot growing a little red in the face but i believe it is more easy to avoid danger than to overcome it the safest way is the best way even for one who is brave and determined  do not worry for we shall not go far to the north said the emperor my one idea is to avoid the emerald city without going out of our way more than is necessary once around the emerald city we will turn south into the munchkin country where the scarecrow and i are well acquainted and have many friends  i have traveled some in the gillikin country remarked the scarecrow and while i must say i have met some strange people there at times i have never yet been harmed by them  well it's all the same to me said woot with assumed carelessness dangers when they cannot be avoided are often quite interesting and i am willing to go wherever you two venture to go  so they left the path they had been following and began to travel toward the northeast and all that day they were in the pleasant winkie country and all the people they met saluted the emperor with great respect and wished him good luck on his journey at night they stopped at a house where they were well entertained and where woot was given a comfortable bed to sleep in  were the scarecrow and i alone said the tin woodman we would travel by night as well as by day but with a meat person in our party we must halt at night to permit him to rest    meat tires after a day's travel added the scarecrow while straw and tin never tire at all which proves said he that we are somewhat superior to people made in the common way  woot could not deny that he was tired and he slept soundly until morning when he was given a good breakfast smoking hot  you two miss a great deal by not eating he said to his companions  it is true responded the scarecrow we miss suffering from hunger when food cannot be had and we miss a stomach-ache now and then  as he said this the scarecrow glanced at the tin woodman who nodded his assent  all that second day they traveled steadily entertaining one another the while with stories of adventures they had formerly met and listening to the scarecrow recite poetry he had learned a great many poems from professor wogglebug and loved to repeat them whenever anybody would listen to him of course woot and the tin woodman now listened because they could not do otherwise unless they rudely ran away from their stuffed comrade  one of the scarecrow's recitations was like this         what sound is so sweet       as the straw from the wheat     when it crunkles so tender and low       it is yellow and bright       so it gives me delight     to crunkle wherever i go        sweet fresh golden straw       there is surely no flaw     in a stuffing so clean and compact       it creaks when i walk       and it thrills when i talk     and its fragrance is fine for a fact        to cut me don't hurt       for i've no blood to squirt     and i therefore can suffer no pain       the straw that i use       doesn't lump up or bruise     though it's pounded again and again        i know it is said       that my beautiful head     has brains of mixed wheat-straw and bran       but my thoughts are so good       i'd not change if i could     for the brains of a common meat man        content with my lot       i'm glad that i'm not     like others i meet day by day       if my insides get musty       or mussed-up or dusty     i get newly stuffed right away       the loons of loonville    chapter 4   toward evening the travelers found there was no longer a path to guide them and the purple hues of the grass and trees warned them that they were now in the country of the gillikins where strange peoples dwelt in places that were quite unknown to the other inhabitants of oz the fields were wild and uncultivated and there were no houses of any sort to be seen but our friends kept on walking even after the sun went down hoping to find a good place for woot the wanderer to sleep but when it grew quite dark and the boy was weary with his long walk they halted right in the middle of a field and allowed woot to get his supper from the food he carried in his knapsack then the scarecrow laid himself down so that woot could use his stuffed body as a pillow and the tin woodman stood up beside them all night so the dampness of the ground might not rust his joints or dull his brilliant polish whenever the dew settled on his body he carefully wiped it off with a cloth and so in the morning the emperor shone as brightly as ever in the rays of the rising sun  they wakened the boy at daybreak the scarecrow saying to him   we have discovered something queer and therefore we must counsel together what to do about it  what have you discovered asked woot rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his knuckles and giving three wide yawns to prove he was fully awake  a sign said the tin woodman a sign and another path  what does the sign say inquired the boy  it says that 'all strangers are warned not to follow this path to loonville' answered the scarecrow who could read very well when his eyes had been freshly painted  [illustration  all strangers are warned not to follow this path to loonville]  in that case said the boy opening his knapsack to get some breakfast let us travel in some other direction  but this did not seem to please either of his companions  i'd like to see what loonville looks like remarked the tin woodman  when one travels it is foolish to miss any interesting sight added the scarecrow  but a warning means danger protested woot the wanderer and i believe it sensible to keep out of danger whenever we can  they made no reply to this speech for a while then said the scarecrow   i have escaped so many dangers during my lifetime that i am not much afraid of anything that can happen  nor am i exclaimed the tin woodman swinging his glittering axe around his tin head in a series of circles few things can injure tin and my axe is a powerful weapon to use against a foe but our boy friend he continued looking solemnly at woot might perhaps be injured if the people of loonville are really dangerous so i propose he waits here while you and i friend scarecrow visit the forbidden city of loonville  don't worry about me advised woot calmly wherever you wish to go i will go and share your dangers during my wanderings i have found it more wise to keep out of danger than to venture in but at that time i was alone and now i have two powerful friends to protect me  so when he had finished his breakfast they all set out along the path that led to loonville  it is a place i have never heard of before remarked the scarecrow as they approached a dense forest the inhabitants may be people of some sort or they may be animals but whatever they prove to be we will have an interesting story to relate to dorothy and ozma on our return  the path led into the forest but the big trees grew so closely together and the vines and underbrush were so thick and matted that they had to clear a path at each step in order to proceed in one or two places the tin man who went first to clear the way cut the branches with a blow of his axe woot followed next and last of the three came the scarecrow who could not have kept the path at all had not his comrades broken the way for his straw-stuffed body  presently the tin woodman pushed his way through some heavy underbrush and almost tumbled headlong into a vast cleared space in the forest the clearing was circular big and roomy yet the top branches of the tall trees reached over and formed a complete dome or roof for it strangely enough it was not dark in this immense natural chamber in the woodland for the place glowed with a soft white light that seemed to come from some unseen source  in the chamber were grouped dozens of queer creatures and these so astonished the tin man that woot had to push his metal body aside that he might see too and the scarecrow pushed woot aside so that the three travelers stood in a row staring with all their eyes  the creatures they beheld were round and ball-like round in body round in legs and arms round in hands and feet and round of head the only exception to the roundness was a slight hollow on the top of each head making it saucer-shaped instead of dome-shaped they wore no clothes on their puffy bodies nor had they any hair their skins were all of a light gray color and their eyes were mere purple spots their noses were as puffy as the rest of them  are they rubber do you think asked the scarecrow who noticed that the creatures bounded as they moved and seemed almost as light as air  it is difficult to tell what they are answered woot they seem to be covered with warts  the loons for so these folks were called had been doing many things some playing together some working at tasks and some gathered in groups to talk but at the sound of strange voices which echoed rather loudly through the clearing all turned in the direction of the intruders then in a body they all rushed forward running and bounding with tremendous speed  the tin woodman was so surprised by this sudden dash that he had no time to raise his axe before the loons were on them the creatures swung their puffy hands which looked like boxing-gloves and pounded the three travelers as hard as they could on all sides the blows were quite soft and did not hurt our friends at all but the onslaught quite bewildered them so that in a brief period all three were knocked over and fell flat upon the ground once down many of the loons held them to prevent their getting up again while others wound long tendrils of vines about them binding their arms and legs to their bodies and so rendering them helpless  aha cried the biggest loon of all we've got 'em safe so let's carry 'em to king bal and have 'em tried and condemned and perforated  they had to drag their captives to the center of the domed chamber for their weight as compared with that of the loons prevented their being carried even the scarecrow was much heavier than the puffy loons but finally the party halted before a raised platform on which stood a sort of throne consisting of a big wide chair with a string tied to one arm of it this string led upward to the roof of the dome  arranged before the platform the prisoners were allowed to sit up facing the empty throne  good said the big loon who had commanded the party now to get king bal to judge these terrible creatures we have so bravely captured  as he spoke he took hold of the string and began to pull as hard as he could one or two of the others helped him and pretty soon as they drew in the cord the leaves above them parted and a loon appeared at the other end of the string it didn't take long to draw him down to the throne where he seated himself and was tied in so he wouldn't float upward again  hello said the king blinking his purple eyes at his followers what's up now  strangers your majesty strangers and captives replied the big loon pompously  dear me i see 'em i see 'em very plainly exclaimed the king his purple eyes bulging out as he looked at the three prisoners what curious animals are they dangerous do you think my good panta  i'm 'fraid so your majesty of course they may not be dangerous but we mustn't take chances enough accidents happen to us poor loons as it is and my advice is to condemn and perforate 'em as quickly as possible  keep your advice to yourself said the monarch in a peeved tone who's king here anyhow you or me  we made you our king because you have less common sense than the rest of us answered panta loon indignantly i could have been king myself had i wanted to but i didn't care for the hard work and responsibility  as he said this the big loon strutted back and forth in the space between the throne of king bal and the prisoners and the other loons seemed much impressed by his defiance but suddenly there came a sharp report and panta loon instantly disappeared to the great astonishment of the scarecrow the tin woodman and woot the wanderer who saw on the spot where the big fellow had stood a little heap of flabby wrinkled skin that looked like a collapsed rubber balloon  there exclaimed the king i expected that would happen the conceited rascal wanted to puff himself up until he was bigger than the rest of you and this is the result of his folly get the pump working some of you and blow him up again  we will have to mend the puncture first your majesty suggested one of the loons and the prisoners noticed that none of them seemed surprised or shocked at the sad accident to panta  all right grumbled the king fetch til to mend him  one or two ran away and presently returned followed by a lady loon wearing huge puffed-up rubber skirts also she had a purple feather fastened to a wart on the top of her head and around her waist was a sash of fibre-like vines dried and tough that looked like strings  get to work til commanded king bal panta has just exploded  the lady loon picked up the bunch of skin and examined it carefully until she discovered a hole in one foot then she pulled a strand of string from her sash and drawing the edges of the hole together she tied them fast with the string thus making one of those curious warts which the strangers had noticed on so many loons having done this til loon tossed the bit of skin to the other loons and was about to go away when she noticed the prisoners and stopped to inspect them  dear me said til what dreadful creatures where did they come from  we captured them replied one of the loons  and what are we going to do with them inquired the girl loon  perhaps we'll condemn 'em and puncture 'em answered the king  well said she still eyeing the captives i'm not sure they'll puncture let's try it and see  one of the loons ran to the forest's edge and quickly returned with a long sharp thorn he glanced at the king who nodded his head in assent and then he rushed forward and stuck the thorn into the leg of the scarecrow the scarecrow merely smiled and said nothing for the thorn didn't hurt him at all  then the loon tried to prick the tin woodman's leg but the tin only blunted the point of the thorn    just as i thought said til blinking her purple eyes and shaking her puffy head but just then the loon stuck the thorn into the leg of woot the wanderer and while it had been blunted somewhat it was still sharp enough to hurt  ouch yelled woot and kicked out his leg with so much energy that the frail bonds that tied him burst apart his foot caught the loon who was leaning over him full on his puffy stomach and sent him shooting up into the air when he was high over their heads he exploded with a loud pop and his skin fell to the ground  i really believe said the king rolling his spot-like eyes in a frightened way that panta was right in claiming these prisoners are dangerous is the pump ready  some of the loons had wheeled a big machine in front of the throne and now took panta's skin and began to pump air into it slowly it swelled out until the king cried stop  no no yelled panta i'm not big enough yet  you're as big as you're going to be declared the king before you exploded you were bigger than the rest of us and that caused you to be proud and overbearing now you're a little smaller than the rest and you will last longer and be more humble  pump me up pump me up wailed panta if you don't you'll break my heart  if we do we'll break your skin replied the king  so the loons stopped pumping air into panta and pushed him away from the pump he was certainly more humble than before his accident for he crept into the background and said nothing more    now pump up the other one ordered the king til had already mended him and the loons set to work to pump him full of air  during these last few moments none had paid much attention to the prisoners so woot finding his legs free crept over to the tin woodman and rubbed the bonds that were still around his arms and body against the sharp edge of the axe which quickly cut them  the boy was now free and the thorn which the loon had stuck into his leg was lying unnoticed on the ground where the creature had dropped it when he exploded woot leaned forward and picked up the thorn and while the loons were busy watching the pump the boy sprang to his feet and suddenly rushed upon the group  pop pop pop went three of the loons when the wanderer pricked them with his thorn and at the sounds the others looked around and saw their danger with yells of fear they bounded away in all directions scattering about the clearing with woot the wanderer in full chase while they could run much faster than the boy they often stumbled and fell or got in one another's way so he managed to catch several and prick them with his thorn  it astonished him to see how easily the loons exploded when the air was let out of them they were quite helpless til loon was one of those who ran against his thorn and many others suffered the same fate the creatures could not escape from the enclosure but in their fright many bounded upward and caught branches of the trees and then climbed out of reach of the dreaded thorn  woot was getting pretty tired chasing them so he stopped and came over panting to where his friends were sitting still bound  very well done my wanderer said the tin woodman it is evident that we need fear these puffed-up creatures no longer so be kind enough to unfasten our bonds and we will proceed upon our journey  woot untied the bonds of the scarecrow and helped him to his feet then he freed the tin woodman who got up without help looking around them they saw that the only loon now remaining within reach was bal loon the king who had remained seated in his throne watching the punishment of his people with a bewildered look in his purple eyes  shall i puncture the king the boy asked his companions    king bal must have overheard the question for he fumbled with the cord that fastened him to the throne and managed to release it then he floated upward until he reached the leafy dome and parting the branches he disappeared from sight but the string that was tied to his body was still connected with the arm of the throne and they knew they could pull his majesty down again if they wanted to  let him alone suggested the scarecrow he seems a good enough king for his peculiar people and after we are gone the loons will have something of a job to pump up all those whom woot has punctured  every one of them ought to be exploded declared woot who was angry because his leg still hurt him  no said the tin woodman that would not be just fair they were quite right to capture us because we had no business to intrude here having been warned to keep away from loonville this is their country not ours and since the poor things can't get out of the clearing they can harm no one save those who venture here out of curiosity as we did  well said my friend agreed the scarecrow we really had no right to disturb their peace and comfort so let us go away  they easily found the place where they had forced their way into the enclosure so the tin woodman pushed aside the underbrush and started first along the path the scarecrow followed next and last came woot who looked back and saw that the loons were still clinging to their perches on the trees and watching their former captives with frightened eyes  i guess they're glad to see the last of us remarked the boy and laughing at the happy ending of the adventure he followed his comrades along the path       mrs yoop the giantess    chapter 5   when they had reached the end of the path where they had first seen the warning sign they set off across the country in an easterly direction before long they reached rolling lands which were a succession of hills and valleys where constant climbs and descents were required and their journey now became tedious because on climbing each hill they found before them nothing in the valley below it except grass or weeds or stones  up and down they went for hours with nothing to relieve the monotony of the landscape until finally when they had topped a higher hill than usual they discovered a cup-shaped valley before them in the center of which stood an enormous castle built of purple stone the castle was high and broad and long but had no turrets and towers so far as they could see there was but one small window and one big door on each side of the great building  this is strange mused the scarecrow i'd no idea such a big castle existed in this gillikin country i wonder who lives here  it seems to me from this distance remarked the tin woodman that it's the biggest castle i ever saw it is really too big for any use and no one could open or shut those big doors without a stepladder  perhaps if we go nearer we shall find out whether anybody lives there or not suggested woot looks to me as if nobody lived there  on they went and when they reached the center of the valley where the great stone castle stood it was beginning to grow dark so they hesitated as to what to do  if friendly people happen to live here said woot i shall be glad of a bed but should enemies occupy the place i prefer to sleep upon the ground  and if no one at all lives here added the scarecrow we can enter and take possession and make ourselves at home  while speaking he went nearer to one of the great doors which was three times as high and broad as any he had ever seen in a house before and then he discovered engraved in big letters upon a stone over the doorway the words   yoop castle  oho he exclaimed i know the place now this was probably the home of mr yoop a terrible giant whom i have seen confined in a cage a long way from here therefore this castle is likely to be empty and we may use it in any way we please  yes yes said the tin emperor nodding i also remember mr yoop but how are we to get into his deserted castle the latch of the door is so far above our heads that none of us can reach it  they considered this problem for a while and then woot said to the tin man     if i stand upon your shoulders i think i can unlatch the door  climb up then was the reply and when the boy was perched upon the tin shoulders of nick chopper he was just able to reach the latch and raise it  at once the door swung open its great hinges making a groaning sound as if in protest so woot leaped down and followed his companions into a big bare hallway scarcely were the three inside however when they heard the door slam shut behind them and this astonished them because no one had touched it it had closed of its own accord as if by magic moreover the latch was on the outside and the thought occurred to each one of them that they were now prisoners in this unknown castle  however mumbled the scarecrow we are not to blame for what cannot be helped so let us push bravely ahead and see what may be seen  it was quite dark in the hallway now that the outside door was shut so as they stumbled along a stone passage they kept close together not knowing what danger was likely to befall them  suddenly a soft glow enveloped them it grew brighter until they could see their surroundings distinctly they had reached the end of the passage and before them was another huge door this noiselessly swung open before them without the help of anyone and through the doorway they observed a big chamber the walls of which were lined with plates of pure gold highly polished  this room was also lighted although they could discover no lamps and in the center of it was a great table at which sat an immense woman she was clad in silver robes embroidered with gay floral designs and wore over this splendid raiment a short apron of elaborate lace-work such an apron was no protection and was not in keeping with the handsome gown but the huge woman wore it nevertheless the table at which she sat was spread with a white cloth and had golden dishes upon it so the travelers saw that they had surprised the giantess while she was eating her supper  she had her back toward them and did not even turn around but taking a biscuit from a dish she began to butter it and said in a voice that was big and deep but not especially unpleasant   why don't you come in and allow the door to shut you're causing a draught and i shall catch cold and sneeze when i sneeze i get cross and when i get cross i'm liable to do something wicked come in you foolish strangers come in  being thus urged they entered the room and approached the table until they stood where they faced the great giantess she continued eating but smiled in a curious way as she looked at them woot noticed that the door had closed silently after they had entered and that didn't please him at all  well said the giantess what excuse have you to offer  we didn't know anyone lived here madam explained the scarecrow so being travelers and strangers in these parts and wishing to find a place for our boy friend to sleep we ventured to enter your castle  you knew it was private property i suppose said she buttering another biscuit  we saw the words 'yoop castle' over the door but we knew that mr yoop is a prisoner in a cage in a far-off part of the land of oz so we decided there was no one now at home and that we might use the castle for the night  i see remarked the giantess nodding her head and smiling again in that curious way a way that made woot shudder you didn't know that mr yoop was married or that after he was cruelly captured his wife still lived in his castle and ran it to suit herself  who captured mr yoop asked woot looking gravely at the big woman  wicked enemies people who selfishly objected to yoop's taking their cows and sheep for his food i must admit however that yoop had a bad temper and had the habit of knocking over a few houses now and then when he was angry so one day the little folks came in a great crowd and captured mr yoop and carried him away to a cage somewhere in the mountains i don't know where it is and i don't care for my husband treated me badly at times forgetting the respect a giant owes to a giantess often he kicked me on my shins when i wouldn't wait on him so i'm glad he is gone  it's a wonder the people didn't capture you too remarked woot  well i was too clever for them said she giving a sudden laugh that caused such a breeze that the wobbly scarecrow was almost blown off his feet and had to grab his friend nick chopper to steady himself i saw the people coming continued mrs yoop and knowing they meant mischief i transformed myself into a mouse and hid in a cupboard after they had gone away carrying my shin-kicking husband with them i transformed myself back to my former shape again and here i've lived in peace and comfort ever since  are you a witch then inquired woot  well not exactly a witch she replied but i'm an artist in transformations in other words i'm more of a yookoohoo than a witch and of course you know that the yookoohoos are the cleverest magic-workers in the world  the travelers were silent for a time uneasily considering this statement and the effect it might have on their future no doubt the giantess had wilfully made them her prisoners yet she spoke so cheerfully in her big voice that until now they had not been alarmed in the least  by and by the scarecrow whose mixed brains had been working steadily asked the woman   are we to consider you our friend mrs yoop or do you intend to be our enemy  i never have friends she said in a matter-of-fact tone because friends get too familiar and always forget to mind their own business but i am not your enemy not yet anyhow indeed i'm glad you've come for my life here is rather lonely i've had no one to talk to since i transformed polychrome the daughter of the rainbow into a canary-bird  how did you manage to do that asked the tin woodman in amazement polychrome is a powerful fairy  she was said the giantess but now she's a canary-bird one day after a rain polychrome danced off the rainbow and fell asleep on a little mound in this valley not far from my castle the sun came out and drove the rainbow away and before poly wakened i stole out and transformed her into a canary-bird in a gold cage studded with diamonds the cage was so she couldn't fly away i expected she'd sing and talk and we'd have good times together but she has proved no company for me at all ever since the moment of her transformation she has refused to speak a single word  where is she now inquired woot who had heard tales of lovely polychrome and was much interested in her  the cage is hanging up in my bedroom said the giantess eating another biscuit  the travelers were now more uneasy and suspicious of the giantess than before if polychrome the rainbow's daughter who was a real fairy had been transformed and enslaved by this huge woman who claimed to be a yookoohoo what was liable to happen to them said the scarecrow twisting his stuffed head around in mrs yoop's direction   do you know ma'am who we are  of course said she a straw man a tin man and a boy  we are very important people declared the tin woodman  all the better she replied i shall enjoy your society the more on that account for i mean to keep you here as long as i live to amuse me when i get lonely and she added slowly in this valley no one ever dies  they didn't like this speech at all so the scarecrow frowned in a way that made mrs yoop smile while the tin woodman looked so fierce that mrs yoop laughed the scarecrow suspected she was going to laugh so he slipped behind his friends to escape the wind from her breath from this safe position he said warningly   we have powerful friends who will soon come to rescue us    let them come she returned with an accent of scorn when they get here they will find neither a boy nor a tin man nor a scarecrow for tomorrow morning i intend to transform you all into other shapes so that you cannot be recognized  this threat filled them with dismay the good-natured giantess was more terrible than they had imagined she could smile and wear pretty clothes and at the same time be even more cruel than her wicked husband had been  both the scarecrow and the tin woodman tried to think of some way to escape from the castle before morning but she seemed to read their thoughts and shook her head  don't worry your poor brains said she you can't escape me however hard you try but why should you wish to escape i shall give you new forms that are much better than the ones you now have be contented with your fate for discontent leads to unhappiness and unhappiness in any form is the greatest evil that can befall you  what forms do you intend to give us asked woot earnestly  i haven't decided as yet i'll dream over it tonight so in the morning i shall have made up my mind how to transform you perhaps you'd prefer to choose your own transformations  no said woot i prefer to remain as i am  that's funny she retorted you are little and you're weak as you are you're not much account anyhow the best thing about you is that you're alive for i shall be able to make of you some sort of live creature which will be a great improvement on your present form    she took another biscuit from a plate and dipped it in a pot of honey and calmly began eating it  the scarecrow watched her thoughtfully  there are no fields of grain in your valley said he where then did you get the flour to make your biscuits  mercy me do you think i'd bother to make biscuits out of flour she replied that is altogether too tedious a process for a yookoohoo i set some traps this afternoon and caught a lot of field-mice but as i do not like to eat mice i transformed them into hot biscuits for my supper the honey in this pot was once a wasp's nest but since being transformed it has become sweet and delicious all i need do when i wish to eat is to take something i don't care to keep and transform it into any sort of food i like and eat it are you hungry  i don't eat thank you said the scarecrow  nor do i said the tin woodman  i have still a little natural food in my knapsack said woot the wanderer and i'd rather eat that than any wasp's nest  every one to his taste said the giantess carelessly and having now finished her supper she rose to her feet clapped her hands together and the supper table at once disappeared     the magic of a yookoohoo    chapter 6   woot had seen very little of magic during his wanderings while the scarecrow and the tin woodman had seen a great deal of many sorts in their lives yet all three were greatly impressed by mrs yoop's powers she did not affect any mysterious airs or indulge in chants or mystic rites as most witches do nor was the giantess old and ugly or disagreeable in face or manner nevertheless she frightened her prisoners more than any witch could have done  please be seated she said to them as she sat herself down in a great arm-chair and spread her beautiful embroidered skirts for them to admire but all the chairs in the room were so high that our friends could not climb to the seats of them mrs yoop observed this and waved her hand when instantly a golden ladder appeared leaning against a chair opposite her own  climb up said she and they obeyed the tin man and the boy assisting the more clumsy scarecrow when they were all seated in a row on the cushion of the chair the giantess continued  now tell me how you happened to travel in this direction and where you came from and what your errand is  so the tin woodman told her all about nimmie amee and how he had decided to find her and marry her although he had no loving heart the story seemed to amuse the big woman who then began to ask the scarecrow questions and for the first time in her life heard of ozma of oz and of dorothy and jack pumpkinhead and dr pipt and tik-tok and many other oz people who are well known in the emerald city also woot had to tell his story which was very simple and did not take long the giantess laughed heartily when the boy related their adventure at loonville but said she knew nothing of the loons because she never left her valley  there are wicked people who would like to capture me as they did my giant husband mr yoop said she so i stay at home and mind my own business  if ozma knew that you dared to work magic without her consent she would punish you severely declared the scarecrow for this castle is in the land of oz and no persons in the land of oz are permitted to work magic except glinda the good and the little wizard who lives with ozma in the emerald city  that for your ozma exclaimed the giantess snapping her fingers in derision what do i care for a girl whom i have never seen and who has never seen me  but ozma is a fairy said the tin woodman and therefore she is very powerful also we are under ozma's protection and to injure us in any way would make her extremely angry  what i do here in my own private castle in this secluded valley where no one comes but fools like you can never be known to your fairy ozma returned the giantess do not seek to frighten me from my purpose and do not allow yourselves to be frightened for it is best to meet bravely what cannot be avoided i am now going to bed and in the morning i will give you all new forms such as will be more interesting to me than the ones you now wear good night and pleasant dreams  saying this mrs yoop rose from her chair and walked through a doorway into another room so heavy was the tread of the giantess that even the walls of the big stone castle trembled as she stepped she closed the door of her bedroom behind her and then suddenly the light went out and the three prisoners found themselves in total darkness  the tin woodman and the scarecrow didn't mind the dark at all but woot the wanderer felt worried to be left in this strange place in this strange manner without being able to see any danger that might threaten  the big woman might have given me a bed anyhow he said to his companions and scarcely had he spoken when he felt something press against his legs which were then dangling from the seat of the chair leaning down he put out his hand and found that a bedstead had appeared with mattress sheets and covers all complete he lost no time in slipping down upon the bed and was soon fast asleep  during the night the scarecrow and the emperor talked in low tones together and they got out of the chair and moved all about the room feeling for some hidden spring that might open a door or window and permit them to escape  morning found them still unsuccessful in the quest and as soon as it was daylight woot's bed suddenly disappeared and he dropped to the floor with a thump that quickly wakened him and after a time the giantess came from her bedroom wearing another dress that was quite as elaborate as the one in which she had been attired the evening before and also wearing the pretty lace apron having seated herself in a chair she said   i'm hungry so i'll have breakfast at once  she clapped her hands together and instantly the table appeared before her spread with snowy linen and laden with golden dishes but there was no food upon the table nor anything else except a pitcher of water a bundle of weeds and a handful of pebbles but the giantess poured some water into her coffee-pot patted it once or twice with her hand and then poured out a cupful of steaming hot coffee  would you like some she asked woot  he was suspicious of magic coffee but it smelled so good that he could not resist it so he answered  if you please madam  the giantess poured out another cup and set it on the floor for woot it was as big as a tub and the golden spoon in the saucer beside the cup was so heavy the boy could scarcely lift it but woot managed to get a sip of the coffee and found it delicious  mrs yoop next transformed the weeds into a dish of oatmeal which she ate with good appetite  now then said she picking up the pebbles i'm wondering whether i shall have fish-balls or lamb-chops to complete my meal which would you prefer woot the wanderer  if you please i'll eat the food in my knapsack answered the boy your magic food might taste good but i'm afraid of it  the woman laughed at his fears and transformed the pebbles into fish-balls    i suppose you think that after you had eaten this food it would turn to stones again and make you sick she remarked but that would be impossible nothing i transform ever gets back to its former shape again so these fish-balls can never more be pebbles that is why i have to be careful of my transformations she added busily eating while she talked for while i can change forms at will i can never change them back again which proves that even the powers of a clever yookoohoo are limited when i have transformed you three people you must always wear the shapes that i have given you  then please don't transform us begged woot for we are quite satisfied to remain as we are  i am not expecting to satisfy you but intend to please myself she declared and my pleasure is to give you new shapes for if by chance your friends came in search of you not one of them would be able to recognize you  her tone was so positive that they knew it would be useless to protest the woman was not unpleasant to look at her face was not cruel her voice was big but gracious in tone but her words showed that she possessed a merciless heart and no pleadings would alter her wicked purpose  mrs yoop took ample time to finish her breakfast and the prisoners had no desire to hurry her but finally the meal was concluded and she folded her napkin and made the table disappear by clapping her hands together then she turned to her captives and said   the next thing on the programme is to change your forms  have you decided what forms to give us asked the scarecrow uneasily  yes i dreamed it all out while i was asleep this tin man seems a very solemn person indeed the tin woodman was looking solemn just then for he was greatly disturbed so i shall change him into an owl  all she did was to point one finger at him as she spoke but immediately the form of the tin woodman began to change and in a few seconds nick chopper the emperor of the winkies had been transformed into an owl with eyes as big as saucers and a hooked beak and strong claws but he was still tin he was a tin owl with tin legs and beak and eyes and feathers when he flew to the back of a chair and perched upon it his tin feathers rattled against one another with a tinny clatter  the giantess seemed much amused by the tin owl's appearance for her laugh was big and jolly  you're not liable to get lost said she for your wings and feathers will make a racket wherever you go and on my word a tin owl is so rare and pretty that it is an improvement on the ordinary bird i did not intend to make you tin but i forgot to wish you to be meat however tin you were and tin you are and as it's too late to change you that settles it  until now the scarecrow had rather doubted the possibility of mrs yoop's being able to transform him or his friend the tin woodman for they were not made as ordinary people are he had worried more over what might happen to woot than to himself but now he began to worry about himself  madam he said hastily i consider this action very impolite it may even be called rude considering we are your guests  you are not guests for i did not invite you here she replied  perhaps not but we craved hospitality we threw ourselves upon your mercy so to speak and we now find you have no mercy therefore if you will excuse the expression i must say it is downright wicked to take our proper forms away from us and give us others that we do not care for  are you trying to make me angry she asked frowning  by no means said the scarecrow i'm just trying to make you act more ladylike    oh indeed in my opinion mr scarecrow you are now acting like a bear so a bear you shall be  again the dreadful finger pointed this time in the scarecrow's direction and at once his form began to change in a few seconds he had become a small brown bear but he was stuffed with straw as he had been before and when the little brown bear shuffled across the floor he was just as wobbly as the scarecrow had been and moved just as awkwardly  woot was amazed but he was also thoroughly frightened  did it hurt he asked the little brown bear  no of course not growled the scarecrow in the bear's form but i don't like walking on four legs it's undignified  consider my humiliation chirped the tin owl trying to settle its tin feathers smoothly with its tin beak and i can't see very well either the light seems to hurt my eyes  that's because you are an owl said woot i think you will see better in the dark  well remarked the giantess i'm very well pleased with these new forms for my part and i'm sure you will like them better when you get used to them so now she added turning to the boy it is your turn  don't you think you'd better leave me as i am asked woot in a trembling voice  no she replied i'm going to make a monkey of you i love monkeys they're so cute and i think a green monkey will be lots of fun and amuse me when i am sad  woot shivered for again the terrible magic finger pointed and pointed directly his way he felt himself changing not so very much however and it didn't hurt him a bit he looked down at his limbs and body and found that his clothes were gone and his skin covered with a fine silk-like green fur his hands and feet were now those of a monkey he realized he really was a monkey and his first feeling was one of anger he began to chatter as monkeys do he bounded to the seat of a giant chair and then to its back and with a wild leap sprang upon the laughing giantess his idea was to seize her hair and pull it out by the roots and so have revenge for her wicked transformations but she raised her hand and said   gently my dear monkey gently you're not angry you're happy as can be  woot stopped short no he wasn't a bit angry now he felt as good-humored and gay as ever he did when a boy instead of pulling mrs yoop's hair he perched on her shoulder and smoothed her soft cheek with his hairy paw in return she smiled at the funny green animal and patted his head  very good said the giantess let us all become friends and be happy together how is my tin owl feeling  quite comfortable said the owl i don't like it to be sure but i'm not going to allow my new form to make me unhappy but tell me please  what is a tin owl good for  you are only good to make me laugh replied the giantess  will a stuffed bear also make you laugh inquired the scarecrow sitting back on his haunches to look up at her  of course declared the giantess and i have added a little magic to your transformations to make you all contented with wearing your new forms i'm sorry i didn't think to do that when i transformed polychrome into a canary-bird but perhaps when she sees how cheerful you are she will cease to be silent and sullen and take to singing i will go get the bird and let you see her  with this mrs yoop went into the next room and soon returned bearing a golden cage in which sat upon a swinging perch a lovely yellow canary    polychrome said the giantess permit me to introduce to you a green monkey which used to be a boy called woot the wanderer and a tin owl which used to be a tin woodman named nick chopper and a straw-stuffed little brown bear which used to be a live scarecrow  we already know one another declared the scarecrow the bird is polychrome the rainbow's daughter and she and i used to be good friends  are you really my old friend the scarecrow asked the bird in a sweet low voice  there cried mrs yoop that's the first time she has spoken since she was transformed  i am really your old friend answered the scarecrow but you must pardon me for appearing just now in this brutal form  i am a bird as you are dear poly said the tin woodman but alas a tin owl is not as beautiful as a canary-bird  how dreadful it all is sighed the canary couldn't you manage to escape from this terrible yookoohoo  no answered the scarecrow we tried to escape but failed she first made us her prisoners and then transformed us but how did she manage to get you polychrome  i was asleep and she took unfair advantage of me answered the bird sadly had i been awake i could easily have protected myself  tell me said the green monkey earnestly as he came close to the cage what must we do daughter of the rainbow to escape from these transformations can't you help us being a fairy    at present i am powerless to help even myself replied the canary  that's the exact truth exclaimed the giantess who seemed pleased to hear the bird talk even though it complained you are all helpless and in my power so you may as well make up your minds to accept your fate and be content remember that you are transformed for good since no magic on earth can break your enchantments i am now going out for my morning walk for each day after breakfast i walk sixteen times around my castle for exercise amuse yourselves while i am gone and when i return i hope to find you all reconciled and happy  so the giantess walked to the door by which our friends had entered the great hall and spoke one word  open then the door swung open and after mrs yoop had passed out it closed again with a snap as its powerful bolts shot into place the green monkey had rushed toward the opening hoping to escape but he was too late and only got a bump on his nose as the door slammed shut     the lace apron    chapter 7   now said the canary in a tone more brisk than before we may talk together more freely as mrs yoop cannot hear us perhaps we can figure out a way to escape  open said woot the monkey still facing the door but his command had no effect and he slowly rejoined the others  you cannot open any door or window in this enchanted castle unless you are wearing the magic apron said the canary  what magic apron do you mean asked the tin owl in a curious voice  the lace one which the giantess always wears i have been her prisoner in this cage for several weeks and she hangs my cage in her bedroom every night so that she can keep her eye on me explained polychrome the canary therefore i have discovered that it is the magic apron that opens the doors and windows and nothing else can move them when she goes to bed mrs yoop hangs her apron on the bedpost and one morning she forgot to put it on when she commanded the door to open and the door would not move so then she put on the lace apron and the door obeyed her that was how i learned the magic power of the apron  i see i see said the little brown bear wagging his stuffed head then if we could get the apron from mrs yoop we could open the doors and escape from our prison  that is true and it is the plan i was about to suggest replied polychrome the canary-bird however i don't believe the owl could steal the apron or even the bear but perhaps the monkey could hide in her room at night and get the apron while she is asleep  i'll try it cried woot the monkey i'll try it this very night if i can manage to steal into her bedroom  you mustn't think about it though warned the bird for she can read your thoughts whenever she cares to do so and do not forget before you escape to take me with you once i am out of the power of the giantess i may discover a way to save us all  we won't forget our fairy friend promised the boy but perhaps you can tell me how to get into the bedroom  no declared polychrome i cannot advise you as to that you must watch for a chance and slip in when mrs yoop isn't looking  they talked it over for a while longer and then mrs yoop returned when she entered the door opened suddenly at her command and closed as soon as her huge form had passed through the doorway during that day she entered her bedroom several times on one errand or another but always she commanded the door to close behind her and her prisoners found not the slightest chance to leave the big hall in which they were confined  the green monkey thought it would be wise to make a friend of the big woman so as to gain her confidence so he sat on the back of her chair and chattered to her while she mended her stockings and sewed silver buttons on some golden shoes that were as big as row-boats this pleased the giantess and she would pause at times to pat the monkey's head the little brown bear curled up in a corner and lay still all day the owl and the canary found they could converse together in the bird language which neither the giantess nor the bear nor the monkey could understand so at times they twittered away to each other and passed the long dreary day quite cheerfully  after dinner mrs yoop took a big fiddle from a big cupboard and played such loud and dreadful music that her prisoners were all thankful when at last she stopped and said she was going to bed    after cautioning the monkey and bear and owl to behave themselves during the night she picked up the cage containing the canary and going to the door of her bedroom commanded it to open just then however she remembered she had left her fiddle lying upon a table so she went back for it and put it away in the cupboard and while her back was turned the green monkey slipped through the open door into her bedroom and hid underneath the bed the giantess being sleepy did not notice this and entering her room she made the door close behind her and then hung the bird-cage on a peg by the window then she began to undress first taking off the lace apron and laying it over the bedpost where it was within easy reach of her hand  as soon as mrs yoop was in bed the lights all went out and woot the monkey crouched under the bed and waited patiently until he heard the giantess snoring then he crept out and in the dark felt around until he got hold of the apron which he at once tied around his own waist  next woot tried to find the canary and there was just enough moonlight showing through the window to enable him to see where the cage hung but it was out of his reach at first he was tempted to leave polychrome and escape with his other friends but remembering his promise to the rainbow's daughter woot tried to think how to save her  a chair stood near the window and this showing dimly in the moonlight gave him an idea by pushing against it with all his might he found he could move the giant chair a few inches at a time so he pushed and pushed until the chair was beneath the bird-cage and then he sprang noiselessly upon the seat for his monkey form enabled him to jump higher than he could do as a boy and from there to the back of the chair and so managed to reach the cage and take it off the peg then down he sprang to the floor and made his way to the door    open he commanded and at once the door obeyed and swung open but his voice wakened mrs yoop who gave a wild cry and sprang out of bed with one bound the green monkey dashed through the doorway carrying the cage with him and before the giantess could reach the door it slammed shut and imprisoned her in her own bed-chamber  the noise she made pounding upon the door and her yells of anger and dreadful threats of vengeance filled all our friends with terror and woot the monkey was so excited that in the dark he could not find the outer door of the hall but the tin owl could see very nicely in the dark so he guided his friends to the right place and when all were grouped before the door woot commanded it to open the magic apron proved as powerful as when it had been worn by the giantess so a moment later they had rushed through the passage and were standing in the fresh night air outside the castle free to go wherever they willed     the menace of the forest    chapter 8   quick cried polychrome the canary we must hurry or mrs yoop may find some way to recapture us even now let us get out of her valley as soon as possible  so they set off toward the east moving as swiftly as they could and for a long time they could hear the yells and struggles of the imprisoned giantess the green monkey could run over the ground very swiftly and he carried with him the bird-cage containing polychrome the rainbow's daughter also the tin owl could skip and fly along at a good rate of speed his feathers rattling against one another with a tinkling sound as he moved but the little brown bear being stuffed with straw was a clumsy traveler and the others had to wait for him to follow  however they were not very long in reaching the ridge that led out of mrs yoop's valley and when they had passed this ridge and descended into the next valley they stopped to rest for the green monkey was tired  i believe we are safe now said polychrome when her cage was set down and the others had all gathered around it for mrs yoop dares not go outside of her own valley for fear of being captured by her enemies so we may take our time to consider what to do next  i'm afraid poor mrs yoop will starve to death if no one lets her out of her bedroom said woot who had a heart as kind as that of the tin woodman we've taken her magic apron away and now the doors will never open  don't worry about that advised polychrome mrs yoop has plenty of magic left to console her  are you sure of that asked the green monkey  yes for i've been watching her for weeks said the canary she has six magic hairpins which she wears in her hair and a magic ring which she wears on her thumb and which is invisible to all eyes except those of a fairy and magic bracelets on both her ankles so i am positive that she will manage to find a way out of her prison  she might transform the door into an archway suggested the little brown bear  that would be easy for her said the tin owl but i'm glad she was too angry to think of that before we got out of her valley  well we have escaped the big woman to be sure remarked the green monkey but we still wear the awful forms the cruel yookoohoo gave us how are we going to get rid of these shapes and become ourselves again  none could answer that question they sat around the cage brooding over the problem until the monkey fell asleep seeing this the canary tucked her head under her wing and also slept and the tin owl and the brown bear did not disturb them until morning came and it was broad daylight  i'm hungry said woot when he wakened for his knapsack of food had been left behind at the castle  then let us travel on until we can find something for you to eat returned the scarecrow bear  there is no use in your lugging my cage any farther declared the canary let me out and throw the cage away then i can fly with you and find my own breakfast of seeds also i can search for water and tell you where to find it  so the green monkey unfastened the door of the golden cage and the canary hopped out at first she flew high in the air and made great circles overhead but after a time she returned and perched beside them  at the east in the direction we were following announced the canary there is a fine forest with a brook running through it in the forest there may be fruits or nuts growing or berry bushes at its edge so let us go that way    they agreed to this and promptly set off this time moving more deliberately the tin owl which had guided their way during the night now found the sunshine very trying to his big eyes so he shut them tight and perched upon the back of the little brown bear which carried the owl's weight with ease the canary sometimes perched upon the green monkey's shoulder and sometimes fluttered on ahead of the party and in this manner they traveled in good spirits across that valley and into the next one to the east of it  this they found to be an immense hollow shaped like a saucer and on its farther edge appeared the forest which polychrome had seen from the sky  come to think of it said the tin owl waking up and blinking comically at his friends there's no object now in our traveling to the munchkin country my idea in going there was to marry nimmie amee but however much the munchkin girl may have loved a tin woodman i cannot reasonably expect her to marry a tin owl  there is some truth in that my friend remarked the brown bear and to think that i who was considered the handsomest scarecrow in the world am now condemned to be a scrubby no-account beast whose only redeeming feature is that he is stuffed with straw  consider my case please said woot the cruel giantess has made a monkey of a boy and that is the most dreadful deed of all  your color is rather pretty said the brown bear eyeing woot critically i have never seen a pea-green monkey before and it strikes me you are quite gorgeous  it isn't so bad to be a bird asserted the canary fluttering from one to another with a free and graceful motion but i long to enjoy my own shape again  as polychrome you were the loveliest maiden i have ever seen except of course ozma said the tin owl so the giantess did well to transform you into the loveliest of all birds if you were to be transformed at all but tell me since you are a fairy and have a fairy wisdom  do you think we shall be able to break these enchantments  queer things happen in the land of oz replied the canary again perching on the green monkey's shoulder and turning one bright eye thoughtfully toward her questioner mrs yoop has declared that none of her transformations can ever be changed even by herself but i believe that if we could get to glinda the good sorceress she might find a way to restore us to our natural shapes glinda as you know is the most powerful sorceress in the world and there are few things she cannot do if she tries  in that case said the little brown bear let us return southward and try to get to glinda's castle it lies in the quadling country you know so it is a good way from here  first however let us visit the forest and search for something to eat pleaded woot so they continued on to the edge of the forest which consisted of many tall and beautiful trees they discovered no fruit trees at first so the green monkey pushed on into the forest depths and the others followed close behind him  they were traveling quietly along under the shade of the trees when suddenly an enormous jaguar leaped upon them from a limb and with one blow of his paw sent the little brown bear tumbling over and over until he was stopped by a tree-trunk instantly they all took alarm the tin owl shrieked  hoot hoot and flew straight up to the branch of a tall tree although he could scarcely see where he was going the canary swiftly darted to a place beside the owl and the green monkey sprang up caught a limb and soon scrambled to a high perch of safety  the jaguar crouched low and with hungry eyes regarded the little brown bear which slowly got upon its feet and asked reproachfully   for goodness' sake beast what were you trying to do  trying to get my breakfast answered the jaguar with a snarl and i believe i've succeeded you ought to make a delicious meal unless you happen to be old and tough  i'm worse than that considered as a breakfast said the bear for i'm only a skin stuffed with straw and therefore not fit to eat  indeed cried the jaguar in a disappointed voice then you must be a magic bear or enchanted and i must seek my breakfast from among your companions  with this he raised his lean head to look up at the tin owl and the canary and the monkey and he lashed his tail upon the ground and growled as fiercely as any jaguar could  my friends are enchanted also said the little brown bear  all of them asked the jaguar  yes the owl is tin so you couldn't possibly eat him the canary is a fairy polychrome the daughter of the rainbow and you never could catch her because she can easily fly out of your reach  there still remains the green monkey remarked the jaguar hungrily he is neither made of tin nor stuffed with straw nor can he fly i'm pretty good at climbing trees myself so i think i'll capture the monkey and eat him for my breakfast  woot the monkey hearing this speech from his perch on the tree became much frightened for he knew the nature of jaguars and realized they could climb trees and leap from limb to limb with the agility of cats so he at once began to scamper through the forest as fast as he could go catching at a branch with his long monkey arms and swinging his green body through space to grasp another branch in a neighboring tree and so on while the jaguar followed him from below his eyes fixed steadfastly on his prey but presently woot got his feet tangled in the lace apron which he was still wearing and that tripped him in his flight and made him fall to the ground where the jaguar placed one huge paw upon him and said grimly   i've got you now  the fact that the apron had tripped him made woot remember its magic powers and in his terror he cried out  open without stopping to consider how this command might save him but at the word the earth opened at the exact spot where he lay under the jaguar's paw and his body sank downward the earth closing over it again the last thing woot the monkey saw as he glanced upward was the jaguar peering into the hole in astonishment    he's gone cried the beast with a long-drawn sigh of disappointment he's gone and now i shall have no breakfast  the clatter of the tin owl's wings sounded above him and the little brown bear came trotting up and asked   where is the monkey have you eaten him so quickly  no indeed answered the jaguar he disappeared into the earth before i could take one bite of him  and now the canary perched upon a stump a little way from the forest beast and said   i am glad our friend has escaped you but as it is natural for a hungry beast to wish his breakfast i will try to give you one  thank you replied the jaguar you're rather small for a full meal but it's kind of you to sacrifice yourself to my appetite  oh i don't intend to be eaten i assure you said the canary but as i am a fairy i know something of magic and though i am now transformed into a bird's shape i am sure i can conjure up a breakfast that will satisfy you  if you can work magic why don't you break the enchantment you are under and return to your proper form inquired the beast doubtingly  i haven't the power to do that answered the canary for mrs yoop the giantess who transformed me used a peculiar form of yookoohoo magic that is unknown to me however she could not deprive me of my own fairy knowledge so i will try to get you a breakfast  do you think a magic breakfast would taste good or relieve the pangs of hunger i now suffer asked the jaguar  i am sure it would what would you like to eat  give me a couple of fat rabbits said the beast  rabbits no indeed i'd not allow you to eat the dear little things declared polychrome the canary  well three or four squirrels then pleaded the jaguar  do you think me so cruel demanded the canary indignantly the squirrels are my especial friends  how about a plump owl asked the beast not a tin one you know but a real meat owl  neither beast nor bird shall you have said polychrome in a positive voice  give me a fish then there's a river a little way off proposed the jaguar  no living thing shall be sacrificed to feed you returned the canary  then what in the world do you expect me to eat said the jaguar in a scornful tone  how would mush-and-milk do asked the canary  the jaguar snarled in derision and lashed his tail against the ground angrily    give him some scrambled eggs on toast poly suggested the bear scarecrow he ought to like that  i will responded the canary and fluttering her wings she made a flight of three circles around the stump then she flew up to a tree and the bear and the owl and the jaguar saw that upon the stump had appeared a great green leaf upon which was a large portion of scrambled eggs on toast smoking hot  there said the bear eat your breakfast friend jaguar and be content  the jaguar crept closer to the stump and sniffed the fragrance of the scrambled eggs they smelled so good that he tasted them and they tasted so good that he ate the strange meal in a hurry proving he had been really hungry  i prefer rabbits he muttered licking his chops but i must admit the magic breakfast has filled my stomach full and brought me comfort so i'm much obliged for the kindness little fairy and i'll now leave you in peace  saying this he plunged into the thick underbrush and soon disappeared although they could hear his great body crashing through the bushes until he was far distant  that was a good way to get rid of the savage beast poly said the tin woodman to the canary but i'm surprised that you didn't give our friend woot a magic breakfast when you knew he was hungry  the reason for that answered polychrome was that my mind was so intent on other things that i quite forgot my power to produce food by magic but where is the monkey boy  gone said the scarecrow bear solemnly the earth has swallowed him up       the quarrelsome dragons    chapter 9   the green monkey sank gently into the earth for a little way and then tumbled swiftly through space landing on a rocky floor with a thump that astonished him then he sat up found that no bones were broken and gazed around him  he seemed to be in a big underground cave which was dimly lighted by dozens of big round discs that looked like moons they were not moons however as woot discovered when he had examined the place more carefully they were eyes the eyes were in the heads of enormous beasts whose bodies trailed far behind them each beast was bigger than an elephant and three times as long and there were a dozen or more of the creatures scattered here and there about the cavern on their bodies were big scales as round as pie-plates which were beautifully tinted in shades of green purple and orange on the ends of their long tails were clusters of jewels around the great moon-like eyes were circles of diamonds which sparkled in the subdued light that glowed from the eyes  woot saw that the creatures had wide mouths and rows of terrible teeth and from tales he had heard of such beings he knew he had fallen into a cavern inhabited by the great dragons that had been driven from the surface of the earth and were only allowed to come out once in a hundred years to search for food of course he had never seen dragons before yet there was no mistaking them for they were unlike any other living creatures  woot sat upon the floor where he had fallen staring around and the owners of the big eyes returned his look silently and motionless finally one of the dragons which was farthest away from him asked in a deep grave voice   what was that  and the greatest dragon of all who was just in front of the green monkey answered in a still deeper voice   it is some foolish animal from outside  is it good to eat inquired a smaller dragon beside the great one i'm hungry  hungry exclaimed all the dragons in a reproachful chorus and then the great one said chidingly  tut-tut my son you've no reason to be hungry at this time  why not asked the little dragon i haven't eaten anything in eleven years  eleven years is nothing remarked another dragon sleepily opening and closing his eyes i haven't feasted for eighty-seven years and i dare not get hungry for a dozen or so years to come children who eat between meals should be broken of the habit  all i had eleven years ago was a rhinoceros and that's not a full meal at all grumbled the young one and before that i had waited sixty-two years to be fed so it's no wonder i'm hungry  how old are you now asked woot forgetting his own dangerous position in his interest in the conversation  why i'm i'm  how old am i father asked the little dragon  goodness gracious what a child to ask questions do you want to keep me thinking all the time don't you know that thinking is very bad for dragons returned the big one impatiently  how old am i father persisted the small dragon  about six hundred and thirty i believe ask your mother  no don't said an old dragon in the background haven't i enough worries what with being wakened in the middle of a nap without being obliged to keep track of my children's ages  you've been fast asleep for over sixty years mother said the child dragon how long a nap do you wish  i should have slept forty years longer and this strange little green beast should be punished for falling into our cavern and disturbing us  i didn't know you were here and i didn't know i was going to fall in explained woot  nevertheless here you are said the great dragon and you have carelessly wakened our entire tribe so it stands to reason you must be punished  in what way inquired the green monkey trembling a little  give me time and i'll think of a way you're in no hurry are you asked the great dragon  no indeed cried woot take your time i'd much rather you'd all go to sleep again and punish me when you wake up in a hundred years or so  let me eat him pleaded the littlest dragon  he is too small said the father to eat this one green monkey would only serve to make you hungry for more and there are no more  quit this chatter and let me get to sleep protested another dragon yawning in a fearful manner for when he opened his mouth a sheet of flame leaped forth from it and made woot jump back to get out of its way    in his jump he bumped against the nose of a dragon behind him which opened its mouth to growl and shot another sheet of flame at him the flame was bright but not very hot yet woot screamed with terror and sprang forward with a great bound this time he landed on the paw of the great chief dragon who angrily raised his other front paw and struck the green monkey a fierce blow woot went sailing through the air and fell sprawling upon the rocky floor far beyond the place where the dragon tribe was grouped  all the great beasts were now thoroughly wakened and aroused and they blamed the monkey for disturbing their quiet the littlest dragon darted after woot and the others turned their unwieldy bodies in his direction and followed flashing from their eyes and mouths flames which lighted up the entire cavern  woot almost gave himself up for lost at that moment but he scrambled to his feet and dashed away to the farthest end of the cave the dragons following more leisurely because they were too clumsy to move fast perhaps they thought there was no need of haste as the monkey could not escape from the cave but away up at the end of the place the cavern floor was heaped with tumbled rocks so woot with an agility born of fear climbed from rock to rock until he found himself crouched against the cavern roof there he waited for he could go no farther while on over the tumbled rocks slowly crept the dragons the littlest one coming first because he was hungry as well as angry  the beasts had almost reached him when woot remembering his lace apron now sadly torn and soiled recovered his wits and shouted  open at the cry a hole appeared in the roof of the cavern just over his head and through it the sunlight streamed full upon the green monkey  the dragons paused astonished at the magic and blinking at the sunlight and this gave woot time to climb through the opening as soon as he reached the surface of the earth the hole closed again and the boy monkey realized with a thrill of joy that he had seen the last of the dangerous dragon family  he sat upon the ground still panting hard from his exertions when the bushes before him parted and his former enemy the jaguar appeared  don't run said the woodland beast as woot sprang up you are perfectly safe so far as i am concerned for since you so mysteriously disappeared i have had my breakfast i am now on my way home to sleep the rest of the day  oh indeed returned the green monkey in a tone both sorry and startled which of my friends did you manage to eat  none of them returned the jaguar with a sly grin i had a dish of magic scrambled eggs on toast and it wasn't a bad feast at all there isn't room in me for even you and i don't regret it because i judge from your green color that you are not ripe and would make an indifferent meal we jaguars have to be careful of our digestions farewell friend monkey follow the path i made through the bushes and you will find your friends  with this the jaguar marched on his way and woot took his advice and followed the trail he had made until he came to the place where the little brown bear and the tin owl and the canary were conferring together and wondering what had become of their comrade the green monkey       tommy kwikstep    chapter 10   our best plan said the scarecrow bear when the green monkey had related the story of his adventure with the dragons is to get out of this gillikin country as soon as we can and try to find our way to the castle of glinda the good sorceress there are too many dangers lurking here to suit me and glinda may be able to restore us to our proper forms  if we turn south now the tin owl replied we might go straight into the emerald city that's a place i wish to avoid for i'd hate to have my friends see me in this sad plight and he blinked his eyes and fluttered his tin wings mournfully  but i am certain we have passed beyond emerald city the canary assured him sailing lightly around their heads so should we turn south from here we would pass into the munchkin country and continuing south we would reach the quadling country where glinda's castle is located  well since you're sure of that let's start right away proposed the bear it's a long journey at the best and i'm getting tired of walking on four legs  i thought you never tired being stuffed with straw said woot  i mean that it annoys me to be obliged to go on all fours when two legs are my proper walking equipment replied the scarecrow i consider it beneath my dignity in other words my remarkable brains can tire through humiliation although my body cannot tire  that is one of the penalties of having brains remarked the tin owl with a sigh i have had no brains since i was a man of meat and so i never worry nevertheless i prefer my former manly form to this owl's shape and would be glad to break mrs yoop's enchantment as soon as possible i am so noisy just now that i disturb myself and he fluttered his wings with a clatter that echoed throughout the forest  so being all of one mind they turned southward traveling steadily on until the woods were left behind and the landscape turned from purple tints to blue tints which assured them they had entered the country of the munchkins  now i feel myself more safe said the scarecrow bear i know this country pretty well having been made here by a munchkin farmer and having wandered over these lovely blue lands many times seems to me indeed that i even remember that group of three tall trees ahead of us and if i do we are not far from the home of my friend jinjur  who is jinjur asked woot the green monkey  haven't you heard of jinjur exclaimed the scarecrow in surprise  no said woot is jinjur a man a woman a beast or a bird  jinjur is a girl explained the scarecrow bear she's a fine girl too although a bit restless and liable to get excited once a long time ago she raised an army of girls and called herself 'general jinjur' with her army she captured the emerald city and drove me out of it because i insisted that an army in oz was highly improper but ozma punished the rash girl and afterward jinjur and i became fast friends now jinjur lives peacefully on a farm near here and raises fields of cream-puffs chocolate-caramels and macaroons they say she's a pretty good farmer and in addition to that she's an artist and paints pictures so perfect that one can scarcely tell them from nature she often repaints my face for me when it gets worn or mussy and the lovely expression i wore when the giantess transformed me was painted by jinjur only a month or so ago  it was certainly a pleasant expression agreed woot  jinjur can paint anything continued the scarecrow bear with enthusiasm as they walked along together once when i came to her house my straw was old and crumpled so that my body sagged dreadfully i needed new straw to replace the old but jinjur had no straw on all her ranch and i was really unable to travel farther until i had been restuffed when i explained this to jinjur the girl at once painted a straw-stack which was so natural that i went to it and secured enough straw to fill all my body it was a good quality of straw too and lasted me a long time  this seemed very wonderful to woot who knew that such a thing could never happen in any place but a fairy country like oz  the munchkin country was much nicer than the gillikin country and all the fields were separated by blue fences with grassy lanes and paths of blue ground and the land seemed well cultivated they were on a little hill looking down upon this favored country but had not quite reached the settled parts when on turning a bend in the path they were halted by a form that barred their way  a more curious creature they had seldom seen even in the land of oz where curious creatures abound it had the head of a young man evidently a munchkin with a pleasant face and hair neatly combed but the body was very long for it had twenty legs ten legs on each side and this caused the body to stretch out and lie in a horizontal position so that all the legs could touch the ground and stand firm from the shoulders extended two small arms at least they seemed small beside so many legs  this odd creature was dressed in the regulation clothing of the munchkin people a dark blue coat neatly fitting the long body and each pair of legs having a pair of sky-blue trousers with blue-tinted stockings and blue leather shoes turned up at the pointed toes  i wonder who you are said polychrome the canary fluttering above the strange creature who had probably been asleep on the path  i sometimes wonder myself who i am replied the many-legged young man but in reality i am tommy kwikstep and i live in a hollow tree that fell to the ground with age i have polished the inside of it and made a door at each end and that's a very comfortable residence for me because it just fits my shape  how did you happen to have such a shape asked the scarecrow bear sitting on his haunches and regarding tommy kwikstep with a serious look is the shape natural    no it was wished on me replied tommy with a sigh i used to be very active and loved to run errands for anyone who needed my services that was how i got my name of tommy kwikstep i could run an errand more quickly than any other boy and so i was very proud of myself one day however i met an old lady who was a fairy or a witch or something of the sort and she said if i would run an errand for her to carry some magic medicine to another old woman she would grant me just one wish whatever the wish happened to be of course i consented and taking the medicine i hurried away it was a long distance mostly up hill and my legs began to grow weary without thinking what i was doing i said aloud  'dear me i wish i had twenty legs' and in an instant i became the unusual creature you see beside you twenty legs twenty on one man you may count them if you doubt my word  you've got 'em all right said woot the monkey who had already counted them  after i had delivered the magic medicine to the old woman i returned and tried to find the witch or fairy or whatever she was who had given me the unlucky wish so she could take it away again i've been searching for her ever since but never can i find her continued poor tommy kwikstep sadly  i suppose said the tin owl blinking at him you can travel very fast with those twenty legs  at first i was able to was the reply but i traveled so much searching for the fairy or witch or whatever she was that i soon got corns on my toes now a corn on one toe is not so bad but when you have a hundred toes as i have and get corns on most of them it is far from pleasant instead of running i now painfully crawl and although i try not to be discouraged i do hope i shall find that witch or fairy or whatever she was before long  i hope so too said the scarecrow but after all you have the pleasure of knowing you are unusual and therefore remarkable among the people of oz to be just like other persons is small credit to one while to be unlike others is a mark of distinction  that sounds very pretty returned tommy kwikstep but if you had to put on ten pair of trousers every morning and tie up twenty shoes you would prefer not to be so distinguished  was the witch or fairy or whatever she was an old person with wrinkled skin and half her teeth gone inquired the tin owl  no said tommy kwikstep  then she wasn't old mombi remarked the transformed emperor  i'm not interested in who it wasn't so much as i am in who it was said the twenty-legged young man and whatever or whomsoever she was she has managed to keep out of my way  if you found her do you suppose she'd change you back into a two-legged boy asked woot  perhaps so if i could run another errand for her and so earn another wish  would you really like to be as you were before asked polychrome the canary perching upon the green monkey's shoulder to observe tommy kwikstep more attentively  i would indeed was the earnest reply  then i will see what i can do for you promised the rainbow's daughter and flying to the ground she took a small twig in her bill and with it made several mystic figures on each side of tommy kwikstep  are you a witch or fairy or something of the sort he asked as he watched her wonderingly  the canary made no answer for she was busy but the scarecrow bear replied  yes she's something of the sort and a bird of a magician    the twenty-legged boy's transformation happened so queerly that they were all surprised at its method first tommy kwikstep's last two legs disappeared then the next two and the next and as each pair of legs vanished his body shortened all this while polychrome was running around him and chirping mystical words and when all the young man's legs had disappeared but two he noticed that the canary was still busy and cried out in alarm   stop stop leave me two of my legs or i shall be worse off than before  i know said the canary i'm only removing with my magic the corns from your last ten toes  thank you for being so thoughtful he said gratefully and now they noticed that tommy kwikstep was quite a nice looking young fellow  what will you do now asked woot the monkey  first he answered i must deliver a note which i've carried in my pocket ever since the witch or fairy or whatever she was granted my foolish wish and i am resolved never to speak again without taking time to think carefully on what i am going to say for i realize that speech without thought is dangerous and after i've delivered the note i shall run errands again for anyone who needs my services  so he thanked polychrome again and started away in a different direction from their own and that was the last they saw of tommy kwikstep     jinjur's ranch    chapter 11   as they followed a path down the blue-grass hillside the first house that met the view of the travelers was joyously recognized by the scarecrow bear as the one inhabited by his friend jinjur so they increased their speed and hurried toward it  on reaching the place however they found the house deserted the front door stood open but no one was inside in the garden surrounding the house were neat rows of bushes bearing cream-puffs and macaroons some of which were still green but others ripe and ready to eat farther back were fields of caramels and all the land seemed well cultivated and carefully tended they looked through the fields for the girl farmer but she was nowhere to be seen  well finally remarked the little brown bear let us go into the house and make ourselves at home that will be sure to please my friend jinjur who happens to be away from home just now when she returns she will be greatly surprised  would she care if i ate some of those ripe cream-puffs asked the green monkey  no indeed jinjur is very generous help yourself to all you want said the scarecrow bear  so woot gathered a lot of the cream-puffs that were golden yellow and filled with a sweet creamy substance and ate until his hunger was satisfied then he entered the house with his friends and sat in a rocking-chair just as he was accustomed to do when a boy the canary perched herself upon the mantel and daintily plumed her feathers the tin owl sat on the back of another chair the scarecrow squatted on his hairy haunches in the middle of the room  i believe i remember the girl jinjur remarked the canary in her sweet voice she cannot help us very much except to direct us on our way to glinda's castle for she does not understand magic but she's a good girl honest and sensible and i'll be glad to see her    all our troubles said the owl with a deep sigh arose from my foolish resolve to seek nimmie amee and make her empress of the winkies and while i wish to reproach no one i must say that it was woot the wanderer who put the notion into my head  well for my part i am glad he did responded the canary your journey resulted in saving me from the giantess and had you not traveled to the yoop valley i would still be mrs yoop's prisoner it is much nicer to be free even though i still bear the enchanted form of a canary-bird  do you think we shall ever be able to get our proper forms back again asked the green monkey earnestly  polychrome did not make reply at once to this important question but after a period of thoughtfulness she said   i have been taught to believe that there is an antidote for every magic charm yet mrs yoop insists that no power can alter her transformations i realize that my own fairy magic cannot do it although i have thought that we sky fairies have more power than is accorded to earth fairies the yookoohoo magic is admitted to be very strange in its workings and different from the magic usually practiced but perhaps glinda or ozma may understand it better than i in them lies our only hope unless they can help us we must remain forever as we are  a canary-bird on a rainbow wouldn't be so bad asserted the tin owl winking and blinking with his round tin eyes so if you can manage to find your rainbow again you need have little to worry about  that's nonsense friend chopper exclaimed woot i know just how polychrome feels a beautiful girl is much superior to a little yellow bird and a boy such as i was far better than a green monkey neither of us can be happy again unless we recover our rightful forms  i feel the same way announced the stuffed bear what do you suppose my friend the patchwork girl would think of me if she saw me wearing this beastly shape  she'd laugh till she cried admitted the tin owl for my part i'll have to give up the notion of marrying nimmie amee but i'll try not to let that make me unhappy if it's my duty i'd like to do my duty but if magic prevents my getting married i'll flutter along all by myself and be just as contented  their serious misfortunes made them all silent for a time and as their thoughts were busy in dwelling upon the evils with which fate had burdened them none noticed that jinjur had suddenly appeared in the doorway and was looking at them in astonishment the next moment her astonishment changed to anger for there in her best rocking-chair sat a green monkey a great shiny owl perched upon another chair and a brown bear squatted upon her parlor rug jinjur did not notice the canary but she caught up a broomstick and dashed into the room shouting as she came   get out of here you wild creatures how dare you enter my house  with a blow of her broom she knocked the brown bear over and the tin owl tried to fly out of her reach and made a great clatter with his tin wings the green monkey was so startled by the sudden attack that he sprang into the fireplace where there was fortunately no fire and tried to escape by climbing up the chimney but he found the opening too small and so was forced to drop down again then he crouched trembling in the fireplace his pretty green hair all blackened with soot and covered with ashes from this position woot watched to see what would happen next  stop jinjur stop cried the brown bear when the broom again threatened him don't you know me i'm your old friend the scarecrow  you're trying to deceive me you naughty beast i can see plainly that you are a bear and a mighty poor specimen of a bear too retorted the girl  that's because i'm not properly stuffed he assured her when mrs yoop transformed me she didn't realize i should have more stuffing  who is mrs yoop inquired jinjur pausing with the broom still upraised  a giantess in the gillikin country  oh i begin to understand and mrs yoop transformed you you are really the famous scarecrow of oz  i was jinjur just now i'm as you see me a miserable little brown bear with a poor quality of stuffing that tin owl is none other than our dear tin woodman nick chopper the emperor of the winkies while this green monkey is a nice little boy we recently became acquainted with woot the wanderer  and i said the canary flying close to jinjur am polychrome the daughter of the rainbow in the form of a bird  goodness me cried jinjur amazed that giantess must be a powerful sorceress and as wicked as she is powerful    she's a yookoohoo said polychrome fortunately we managed to escape from her castle and we are now on our way to glinda the good to see if she possesses the power to restore us to our former shapes  then i must beg your pardons all of you must forgive me said jinjur putting away the broom i took you to be a lot of wild unmannerly animals as was quite natural you are very welcome to my home and i'm sorry i haven't the power to help you out of your troubles please use my house and all that i have as if it were your own  at this declaration of peace the bear got upon his feet and the owl resumed his perch upon the chair and the monkey crept out of the fireplace jinjur looked at woot critically and scowled  for a green monkey said she you're the blackest creature i ever saw and you'll get my nice clean room all dirty with soot and ashes whatever possessed you to jump up the chimney  i i was scared explained woot somewhat ashamed  well you need renovating and that's what will happen to you right away come with me she commanded    what are you going to do asked woot  give you a good scrubbing said jinjur  now neither boys nor monkeys relish being scrubbed so woot shrank away from the energetic girl trembling fearfully but jinjur grabbed him by his paw and dragged him out to the back yard where in spite of his whines and struggles she plunged him into a tub of cold water and began to scrub him with a stiff brush and a cake of yellow soap  this was the hardest trial that woot had endured since he became a monkey but no protest had any influence with jinjur who lathered and scrubbed him in a business-like manner and afterward dried him with a coarse towel  the bear and the owl gravely watched this operation and nodded approval when woot's silky green fur shone clear and bright in the afternoon sun the canary seemed much amused and laughed a silvery ripple of laughter as she said   very well done my good jinjur i admire your energy and judgment but i had no idea a monkey could look so comical as this monkey did while he was being bathed  i'm not a monkey declared woot resentfully i'm just a boy in a monkey's shape that's all  if you can explain to me the difference said jinjur i'll agree not to wash you again that is unless you foolishly get into the fireplace all persons are usually judged by the shapes in which they appear to the eyes of others look at me woot what am i  woot looked at her  you're as pretty a girl as i've ever seen he replied  jinjur frowned that is she tried hard to frown  come out into the garden with me she said and i'll give you some of the most delicious caramels you ever ate they're a new variety that no one can grow but me and they have a heliotrope flavor     ozma and dorothy    chapter 12   in her magnificent palace in the emerald city the beautiful girl ruler of all the wonderful land of oz sat in her dainty boudoir with her friend princess dorothy beside her ozma was studying a roll of manuscript which she had taken from the royal library while dorothy worked at her embroidery and at times stooped to pat a shaggy little black dog that lay at her feet the little dog's name was toto and he was dorothy's faithful companion  to judge ozma of oz by the standards of our world you would think her very young perhaps fourteen or fifteen years of age yet for years she had ruled the land of oz and had never seemed a bit older dorothy appeared much younger than ozma she had been a little girl when first she came to the land of oz and she was a little girl still and would never seem to be a day older while she lived in this wonderful fairyland  oz was not always a fairyland i am told once it was much like other lands except it was shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that lay all around it thus preventing its people from all contact with the rest of the world seeing this isolation the fairy band of queen lurline passing over oz while on a journey enchanted the country and so made it a fairyland and queen lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted land of oz and then passed on and forgot all about it  from that moment no one in oz ever died those who were old remained old those who were young and strong did not change as years passed them by the children remained children always and played and romped to their hearts' content while all the babies lived in their cradles and were tenderly cared for and never grew up so people in oz stopped counting how old they were in years for years made no difference in their appearance and could not alter their station they did not get sick so there were no doctors among them accidents might happen to some on rare occasions it is true and while no one could die naturally as other people do it was possible that one might be totally destroyed such incidents however were very unusual and so seldom was there anything to worry over that the oz people were as happy and contented as can be  another strange thing about this fairy land of oz was that whoever managed to enter it from the outside world came under the magic spell of the place and did not change in appearance as long as they lived there so dorothy who now lived with ozma seemed just the same sweet little girl she had been when first she came to this delightful fairyland  perhaps all parts of oz might not be called truly delightful but it was surely delightful in the neighborhood of the emerald city where ozma reigned her loving influence was felt for many miles around but there were places in the mountains of the gillikin country and the forests of the quadling country and perhaps in far-away parts of the munchkin and winkie countries where the inhabitants were somewhat rude and uncivilized and had not yet come under the spell of ozma's wise and kindly rule also when oz first became a fairyland it harbored several witches and magicians and sorcerers and necromancers who were scattered in various parts but most of these had been deprived of their magic powers and ozma had issued a royal edict forbidding anyone in her dominions to work magic except glinda the good and the wizard of oz ozma herself being a real fairy knew a lot of magic but she only used it to benefit her subjects  this little explanation will help you to understand better the story you are reading but most of it is already known to those who are familiar with the oz people whose adventures they have followed in other oz books  ozma and dorothy were fast friends and were much together everyone in oz loved dorothy almost as well as they did their lovely ruler for the little kansas girl's good fortune had not spoiled her or rendered her at all vain she was just the same brave and true and adventurous child as before she lived in a royal palace and became the chum of the fairy ozma  in the room in which the two sat which was one of ozma's private suite of apartments hung the famous magic picture this was the source of constant interest to little dorothy one had but to stand before it and wish to see what any person was doing and at once a scene would flash upon the magic canvas which showed exactly where that person was and like our own moving pictures would reproduce the actions of that person as long as you cared to watch them so today when dorothy tired of her embroidery she drew the curtains from before the magic picture and wished to see what her friend button bright was doing button bright she saw was playing ball with ojo the munchkin boy so dorothy next wished to see what her aunt em was doing the picture showed aunt em quietly engaged in darning socks for uncle henry so dorothy wished to see what her old friend the tin woodman was doing  the tin woodman was then just leaving his tin castle in the company of the scarecrow and woot the wanderer dorothy had never seen this boy before so she wondered who he was also she was curious to know where the three were going for she noticed woot's knapsack and guessed they had started on a long journey she asked ozma about it but ozma did not know  that afternoon dorothy again saw the travelers in the magic picture but they were merely tramping through the country and dorothy was not much interested in them a couple of days later however the girl being again with ozma wished to see her friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman in the magic picture and on this occasion found them in the great castle of mrs yoop the giantess who was at the time about to transform them both dorothy and ozma now became greatly interested and watched the transformations with indignation and horror  what a wicked giantess exclaimed dorothy  yes answered ozma she must be punished for this cruelty to our friends and to the poor boy who is with them  after this they followed the adventure of the little brown bear and the tin owl and the green monkey with breathless interest and were delighted when they escaped from mrs yoop they did not know then who the canary was but realized it must be the transformation of some person of consequence whom the giantess had also enchanted    when finally the day came when the adventurers headed south into the munchkin country dorothy asked anxiously   can't something be done for them ozma can't you change 'em back into their own shapes they've suffered enough from these dreadful transformations seems to me  i've been studying ways to help them ever since they were transformed replied ozma mrs yoop is now the only yookoohoo in my dominions and the yookoohoo magic is very peculiar and hard for others to understand yet i am resolved to make the attempt to break these enchantments i may not succeed but i shall do the best i can from the directions our friends are taking i believe they are going to pass by jinjur's ranch so if we start now we may meet them there would you like to go with me dorothy  of course answered the little girl i wouldn't miss it for anything  then order the red wagon said ozma of oz and we will start at once  dorothy ran to do as she was bid while ozma went to her magic room to make ready the things she believed she would need in half an hour the red wagon stood before the grand entrance of the palace and before it was hitched the wooden sawhorse which was ozma's favorite steed    this sawhorse while made of wood was very much alive and could travel swiftly and without tiring to keep the ends of his wooden legs from wearing down short ozma had shod the sawhorse with plates of pure gold his harness was studded with brilliant emeralds and other jewels and so while he himself was not at all handsome his outfit made a splendid appearance  since the sawhorse could understand her spoken words ozma used no reins to guide him she merely told him where to go when she came from the palace with dorothy they both climbed into the red wagon and then the little dog toto ran up and asked   are you going to leave me behind dorothy  dorothy looked at ozma who smiled in return and said   toto may go with us if you wish him to  so dorothy lifted the little dog into the wagon for while he could run fast he could not keep up with the speed of the wonderful sawhorse  away they went over hills and through meadows covering the ground with astonishing speed it is not surprising therefore that the red wagon arrived before jinjur's house just as that energetic young lady had finished scrubbing the green monkey and was about to lead him to the caramel patch     the restoration    chapter 13   the tin owl gave a hoot of delight when he saw the red wagon draw up before jinjur's house and the brown bear grunted and growled with glee and trotted toward ozma as fast as he could wobble as for the canary it flew swiftly to dorothy's shoulder and perched there saying in her ear   thank goodness you have come to our rescue  but who are you asked dorothy  don't you know returned the canary  no for the first time we noticed you in the magic picture you were just a bird as you are now but we've guessed that the giant woman had transformed you as she did the others  yes i'm polychrome the rainbow's daughter announced the canary  goodness me cried dorothy how dreadful  well i make a rather pretty bird i think returned polychrome but of course i'm anxious to resume my own shape and get back upon my rainbow  ozma will help you i'm sure said dorothy how does it feel scarecrow to be a bear she asked addressing her old friend  i don't like it declared the scarecrow bear this brutal form is quite beneath the dignity of a wholesome straw man  and think of me said the owl perching upon the dashboard of the red wagon with much noisy clattering of his tin feathers don't i look horrid dorothy with eyes several sizes too big for my body and so weak that i ought to wear spectacles  well said dorothy critically as she looked him over you're nothing to brag of i must confess but ozma will soon fix you up again  the green monkey had hung back bashful at meeting two lovely girls while in the form of a beast but jinjur now took his hand and led him forward while she introduced him to ozma and woot managed to make a low bow not really ungraceful before her girlish majesty the ruler of oz  you have all been forced to endure a sad experience said ozma and so i am anxious to do all in my power to break mrs yoop's enchantments but first tell me how you happened to stray into that lonely valley where yoop castle stands  between them they related the object of their journey the scarecrow bear telling of the tin woodman's resolve to find nimmie amee and marry her as a just reward for her loyalty to him woot told of their adventures with the loons of loonville and the tin owl described the manner in which they had been captured and transformed by the giantess then polychrome related her story and when all had been told and dorothy had several times reproved toto for growling at the tin owl ozma remained thoughtful for a while pondering upon what she had heard finally she looked up and with one of her delightful smiles said to the anxious group   i am not sure my magic will be able to restore every one of you because your transformations are of such a strange and unusual character indeed mrs yoop was quite justified in believing no power could alter her enchantments however i am sure i can restore the scarecrow to his original shape he was stuffed with straw from the beginning and even the yookoohoo magic could not alter that the giantess was merely able to make a bear's shape of a man's shape but the bear is stuffed with straw just as the man was so i feel confident i can make a man of the bear again  hurrah cried the brown bear and tried clumsily to dance a jig of delight  as for the tin woodman his case is much the same resumed ozma still smiling the power of the giantess could not make him anything but a tin creature whatever shape she transformed him into so it will not be impossible to restore him to his manly form anyhow i shall test my magic at once and see if it will do what i have promised    she drew from her bosom a small silver wand and making passes with the wand over the head of the bear she succeeded in the brief space of a moment in breaking his enchantment the original scarecrow of oz again stood before them well stuffed with straw and with his features nicely painted upon the bag which formed his head  the scarecrow was greatly delighted as you may suppose and he strutted proudly around while the powerful fairy ozma of oz broke the enchantment that had transformed the tin woodman and made a tin owl into a tin man again  now then chirped the canary eagerly i'm next ozma  but your case is different replied ozma no longer smiling but wearing a grave expression on her sweet face i shall have to experiment on you polychrome and i may fail in all my attempts  she then tried two or three different methods of magic hoping one of them would succeed in breaking polychrome's enchantment but still the rainbow's daughter remained a canary-bird finally however she experimented in another way she transformed the canary into a dove and then transformed the dove into a speckled hen and then changed the speckled hen into a rabbit and then the rabbit into a fawn and at the last after mixing several powders and sprinkling them upon the fawn the yookoohoo enchantment was suddenly broken and before them stood one of the daintiest and loveliest creatures in any fairyland in the world polychrome was as sweet and merry in disposition as she was beautiful and when she danced and capered around in delight her beautiful hair floated around her like a golden mist and her many-hued raiment as soft as cobwebs reminded one of drifting clouds in a summer sky  woot was so awed by the entrancing sight of this exquisite sky fairy that he quite forgot his own sad plight until he noticed ozma gazing upon him with an intent expression that denoted sympathy and sorrow dorothy whispered in her friend's ear but the ruler of oz shook her head sadly  jinjur noticing this and understanding ozma's looks took the paw of the green monkey in her own hand and patted it softly  never mind she said to him you are a very beautiful color and a monkey can climb better than a boy and do a lot of other things no boy can ever do  what's the matter asked woot a sinking feeling at his heart is ozma's magic all used up    ozma herself answered him  your form of enchantment my poor boy she said pityingly is different from that of the others indeed it is a form that is impossible to alter by any magic known to fairies or yookoohoos the wicked giantess was well aware when she gave you the form of a green monkey that the green monkey must exist in the land of oz for all future time  woot drew a long sigh  well that's pretty hard luck he said bravely but if it can't be helped i must endure it that's all i don't like being a monkey but what's the use of kicking against my fate  they were all very sorry for him and dorothy anxiously asked ozma   couldn't glinda save him  no was the reply glinda's power in transformations is no greater than my own before i left my palace i went to my magic room and studied woot's case very carefully i found that no power can do away with the green monkey he might transfer or exchange his form with some other person it is true but the green monkey we cannot get rid of by any magic arts known to science  but see here said the scarecrow who had listened intently to this explanation why not put the monkey's form on some one else  who would agree to make the change asked ozma if by force we caused anyone else to become a green monkey we would be as cruel and wicked as mrs yoop and what good would an exchange do she continued suppose for instance we worked the enchantment and made toto into a green monkey at the same moment woot would become a little dog  leave me out of your magic please said toto with a reproachful growl i wouldn't become a green monkey for anything  and i wouldn't become a dog said woot a green monkey is much better than a dog it seems to me  that is only a matter of opinion answered toto  now here's another idea said the scarecrow my brains are working finely today you must admit why not transform toto into woot the wanderer and then have them exchange forms the dog would become a green monkey and the monkey would have his own natural shape again  to be sure cried jinjur that's a fine idea  leave me out of it said toto i won't do it  wouldn't you be willing to become a green monkey see what a pretty color it is so that this poor boy could be restored to his own shape asked jinjur pleadingly  no said toto  i don't like that plan the least bit declared dorothy for then i wouldn't have any little dog  but you'd have a green monkey in his place persisted jinjur who liked woot and wanted to help him  i don't want a green monkey said dorothy positively  don't speak of this again i beg of you said woot this is my own misfortune and i would rather suffer it alone than deprive princess dorothy of her dog or deprive the dog of his proper shape and perhaps even her majesty ozma of oz might not be able to transform anyone else into the shape of woot the wanderer  yes i believe i might do that ozma returned but woot is quite right we are not justified in inflicting upon anyone man or dog the form of a green monkey also it is certain that in order to relieve the boy of the form he now wears we must give it to someone else who would be forced to wear it always  i wonder said dorothy thoughtfully if we couldn't find someone in the land of oz who would be willing to become a green monkey seems to me a monkey is active and spry and he can climb trees and do a lot of clever things and green isn't a bad color for a monkey it makes him unusual  i wouldn't ask anyone to take this dreadful form said woot it wouldn't be right you know i've been a monkey for some time now and i don't like it it makes me ashamed to be a beast of this sort when by right of birth i'm a boy so i'm sure it would be wicked to ask anyone else to take my place  they were all silent for they knew he spoke the truth dorothy was almost ready to cry with pity and ozma's sweet face was sad and disturbed the scarecrow rubbed and patted his stuffed head to try to make it think better while the tin woodman went into the house and began to oil his tin joints so that the sorrow of his friends might not cause him to weep weeping is liable to rust tin and the emperor prided himself upon his highly polished body now doubly dear to him because for a time he had been deprived of it  polychrome had danced down the garden paths and back again a dozen times for she was seldom still a moment yet she had heard ozma's speech and understood very well woot's unfortunate position but the rainbow's daughter even while dancing could think and reason very clearly and suddenly she solved the problem in the nicest possible way coming close to ozma she said   your majesty all this trouble was caused by the wickedness of mrs yoop the giantess yet even now that cruel woman is living in her secluded castle enjoying the thought that she has put this terrible enchantment on woot the wanderer even now she is laughing at our despair because we can find no way to get rid of the green monkey very well we do not wish to get rid of it let the woman who created the form wear it herself as a just punishment for her wickedness i am sure your fairy power can give to mrs yoop the form of woot the wanderer even at this distance from her and then it will be possible to exchange the two forms mrs yoop will become the green monkey and woot will recover his own form again    ozma's face brightened as she listened to this clever proposal  thank you polychrome said she the task you propose is not so easy as you suppose but i will make the attempt and perhaps i may succeed       the green monkey    chapter 14   they now entered the house and as an interested group watched jinjur at ozma's command build a fire and put a kettle of water over to boil the ruler of oz stood before the fire silent and grave while the others realizing that an important ceremony of magic was about to be performed stood quietly in the background so as not to interrupt ozma's proceedings only polychrome kept going in and coming out humming softly to herself as she danced for the rainbow's daughter could not keep still for long and the four walls of a room always made her nervous and ill at ease she moved so noiselessly however that her movements were like the shifting of sunbeams and did not annoy anyone  when the water in the kettle bubbled ozma drew from her bosom two tiny packets containing powders these powders she threw into the kettle and after briskly stirring the contents with a branch from a macaroon bush ozma poured the mystic broth upon a broad platter which jinjur had placed upon the table as the broth cooled it became as silver reflecting all objects from its smooth surface like a mirror  while her companions gathered around the table eagerly attentive and dorothy even held little toto in her arms that he might see ozma waved her wand over the mirror-like surface at once it reflected the interior of yoop castle and in the big hall sat mrs yoop in her best embroidered silken robes engaged in weaving a new lace apron to replace the one she had lost    the giantess seemed rather uneasy as if she had a faint idea that someone was spying upon her for she kept looking behind her and this way and that as though expecting danger from an unknown source perhaps some yookoohoo instinct warned her woot saw that she had escaped from her room by some of the magical means at her disposal after her prisoners had escaped her she was now occupying the big hall of her castle as she used to do also woot thought from the cruel expression on the face of the giantess that she was planning revenge on them as soon as her new magic apron was finished  but ozma was now making passes over the platter with her silver wand and presently the form of the giantess began to shrink in size and to change its shape and now in her place sat the form of woot the wanderer and as if suddenly realizing her transformation mrs yoop threw down her work and rushed to a looking-glass that stood against the wall of her room when she saw the boy's form reflected as her own she grew violently angry and dashed her head against the mirror smashing it to atoms  just then ozma was busy with her magic wand making strange figures and she had also placed her left hand firmly upon the shoulder of the green monkey so now as all eyes were turned upon the platter the form of mrs yoop gradually changed again she was slowly transformed into the green monkey and at the same time woot slowly regained his natural form  it was quite a surprise to them all when they raised their eyes from the platter and saw woot the wanderer standing beside ozma and when they glanced at the platter again it reflected nothing more than the walls of the room in jinjur's house in which they stood the magic ceremonial was ended and ozma of oz had triumphed over the wicked giantess  what will become of her i wonder said dorothy as she drew a long breath  she will always remain a green monkey replied ozma and in that form she will be unable to perform any magical arts whatsoever she need not be unhappy however and as she lives all alone in her castle she probably won't mind the transformation very much after she gets used to it  anyhow it serves her right declared dorothy and all agreed with her  but said the kind hearted tin woodman i'm afraid the green monkey will starve for mrs yoop used to get her food by magic and now that the magic is taken away from her what can she eat  why she'll eat what other monkeys do returned the scarecrow even in the form of a green monkey she's a very clever person and i'm sure her wits will show her how to get plenty to eat  don't worry about her advised dorothy she didn't worry about you and her condition is no worse than the condition she imposed on poor woot she can't starve to death in the land of oz that's certain and if she gets hungry at times it's no more than the wicked thing deserves let's forget mrs yoop for in spite of her being a yookoohoo our fairy friends have broken all of her transformations       the man of tin    chapter 15   ozma and dorothy were quite pleased with woot the wanderer whom they found modest and intelligent and very well mannered the boy was truly grateful for his release from the cruel enchantment and he promised to love revere and defend the girl ruler of oz forever afterward as a faithful subject  you may visit me at my palace if you wish said ozma where i will be glad to introduce you to two other nice boys ojo the munchkin and button-bright  thank your majesty replied woot and then he turned to the tin woodman and inquired  what are your further plans mr emperor will you still seek nimmie amee and marry her or will you abandon the quest and return to the emerald city and your own castle  the tin woodman now as highly polished and well-oiled as ever reflected a while on this question and then answered   well i see no reason why i should not find nimmie amee we are now in the munchkin country where we are perfectly safe and if it was right for me before our enchantment to marry nimmie amee and make her empress of the winkies it must be right now when the enchantment has been broken and i am once more myself am i correct friend scarecrow  you are indeed answered the scarecrow no one can oppose such logic  but i'm afraid you don't love nimmie amee suggested dorothy  that is just because i can't love anyone replied the tin woodman but if i cannot love my wife i can at least be kind to her and all husbands are not able to do that  do you s'pose nimmie amee still loves you after all these years asked dorothy  i'm quite sure of it and that is why i am going to her to make her happy woot the wanderer thinks i ought to reward her for being faithful to me after my meat body was chopped to pieces and i became tin what do you think ozma  ozma smiled as she said   i do not know your nimmie amee and so i cannot tell what she most needs to make her happy but there is no harm in your going to her and asking her if she still wishes to marry you if she does we will give you a grand wedding at the emerald city and afterward as empress of the winkies nimmie amee would become one of the most important ladies in all oz  so it was decided that the tin woodman would continue his journey and that the scarecrow and woot the wanderer should accompany him as before polychrome also decided to join their party somewhat to the surprise of all  i hate to be cooped up in a palace she said to ozma and of course the first time i meet my rainbow i shall return to my own dear home in the skies where my fairy sisters are even now awaiting me and my father is cross because i get lost so often but i can find my rainbow just as quickly while traveling in the munchkin country as i could if living in the emerald city or any other place in oz so i shall go with the tin woodman and help him woo nimmie amee  dorothy wanted to go too but as the tin woodman did not invite her to join his party she felt she might be intruding if she asked to be taken she hinted but she found he didn't take the hint it is quite a delicate matter for one to ask a girl to marry him however much she loves him and perhaps the tin woodman did not desire to have too many looking on when he found his old sweetheart nimmie amee so dorothy contented herself with the thought that she would help ozma prepare a splendid wedding feast to be followed by a round of parties and festivities when the emperor of the winkies reached the emerald city with his bride  ozma offered to take them all in the red wagon to a place as near to the great munchkin forest as a wagon could get the red wagon was big enough to seat them all and so bidding good-bye to jinjur who gave woot a basket of ripe cream-puffs and caramels to take with him ozma commanded the wooden sawhorse to start and the strange creature moved swiftly over the lanes and presently came to the road of yellow bricks this road led straight to a dense forest where the path was too narrow for the red wagon to proceed farther so here the party separated  ozma and dorothy and toto returned to the emerald city after wishing their friends a safe and successful journey while the tin woodman the scarecrow woot the wanderer and polychrome the rainbow's daughter prepared to push their way through the thick forest however these forest paths were well known to the tin man and the scarecrow who felt quite at home among the trees  i was born in this grand forest said nick chopper the tin emperor speaking proudly and it was here that the witch enchanted my axe and i lost different parts of my meat body until i became all tin here also for it is a big forest nimmie amee lived with the wicked witch and at the other edge of the trees stands the cottage of my friend ku-klip the famous tinsmith who made my present beautiful form  he must be a clever workman declared woot admiringly  he is simply wonderful declared the tin woodman  i shall be glad to make his acquaintance said woot  if you wish to meet with real cleverness remarked the scarecrow you should visit the munchkin farmer who first made me i won't say that my friend the emperor isn't all right for a tin man but any judge of beauty can understand that a scarecrow is far more artistic and refined  you are too soft and flimsy said the tin woodman  you are too hard and stiff said the scarecrow and this was as near to quarreling as the two friends ever came polychrome laughed at them both as well she might and woot hastened to change the subject  at night they all camped underneath the trees the boy ate cream-puffs for supper and offered polychrome some but she preferred other food and at daybreak sipped the dew that was clustered thick on the forest flowers then they tramped onward again and presently the scarecrow paused and said   it was on this very spot that dorothy and i first met the tin woodman who was rusted so badly that none of his joints would move but after we had oiled him up he was as good as new and accompanied us to the emerald city  ah that was a sad experience asserted the tin woodman soberly i was caught in a rainstorm while chopping down a tree for exercise and before i realized it i was firmly rusted in every joint there i stood axe in hand but unable to move for days and weeks and months indeed i have never known exactly how long the time was but finally along came dorothy and i was saved see this is the very tree i was chopping at the time i rusted  you cannot be far from your old home in that case said woot  no my little cabin stands not a great way off but there is no occasion for us to visit it our errand is with nimmie amee and her house is somewhat farther away to the left of us  didn't you say she lives with a wicked witch who makes her a slave asked the boy  she did but she doesn't was the reply i am told the witch was destroyed when dorothy's house fell on her so now nimmie amee must live all alone i haven't seen her of course since the witch was crushed for at that time i was standing rusted in the forest and had been there a long time but the poor girl must have felt very happy to be free from her cruel mistress  well said the scarecrow let's travel on and find nimmie amee lead on your majesty since you know the way and we will follow  so the tin woodman took a path that led through the thickest part of the forest and they followed it for some time the light was dim here because vines and bushes and leafy foliage were all about them and often the tin man had to push aside the branches that obstructed their way or cut them off with his axe after they had proceeded some distance the emperor suddenly stopped short and exclaimed  good gracious  the scarecrow who was next first bumped into his friend and then peered around his tin body and said in a tone of wonder   well i declare  woot the wanderer pushed forward to see what was the matter and cried out in astonishment     for goodness' sake  then the three stood motionless staring hard until polychrome's merry laughter rang out behind them and aroused them from their stupor  in the path before them stood a tin man who was the exact duplicate of the tin woodman he was of the same size he was jointed in the same manner and he was made of shining tin from top to toe but he stood immovable with his tin jaws half parted and his tin eyes turned upward in one of his hands was held a long gleaming sword yes there was the difference the only thing that distinguished him from the emperor of the winkies this tin man bore a sword while the tin woodman bore an axe  it's a dream it must be a dream gasped woot  that's it of course said the scarecrow there couldn't be two tin woodmen  no agreed polychrome dancing nearer to the stranger this one is a tin soldier don't you see his sword  the tin woodman cautiously put out one tin hand and felt of his double's arm then he said in a voice that trembled with emotion   who are you friend  there was no reply  can't you see he's rusted just as you were once asked polychrome laughing again here nick chopper lend me your oil-can a minute  the tin woodman silently handed her his oil-can without which he never traveled and polychrome first oiled the stranger's tin jaws and then worked them gently to and fro until the tin soldier said   that's enough thank you i can now talk but please oil my other joints  woot seized the oil-can and did this but all the others helped wiggle the soldier's joints as soon as they were oiled until they moved freely  the tin soldier seemed highly pleased at his release he strutted up and down the path saying in a high thin voice       the soldier is a splendid man       when marching on parade     and when he meets the enemy       he never is afraid     he rights the wrongs of nations       his country's flag defends     the foe he'll fight with great delight       but seldom fights his friends     captain fyter    chapter 16   are you really a soldier asked woot when they had all watched this strange tin person parade up and down the path and proudly flourish his sword  i was a soldier was the reply but i've been a prisoner to mr rust so long that i don't know exactly what i am  but dear me cried the tin woodman sadly perplexed how came you to be made of tin  that answered the soldier is a sad sad story i was in love with a beautiful munchkin girl who lived with a wicked witch the witch did not wish me to marry the girl so she enchanted my sword which began hacking me to pieces when i lost my legs i went to the tinsmith ku-klip and he made me some tin legs when i lost my arms ku-klip made me tin arms and when i lost my head he made me this fine one out of tin it was the same way with my body and finally i was all tin but i was not unhappy for ku-klip made a good job of me having had experience in making another tin man before me  yes observed the tin woodman it was ku-klip who made me but tell me what was the name of the munchkin girl you were in love with  she is called nimmie amee said the tin soldier  hearing this they were all so astonished that they were silent for a time regarding the stranger with wondering looks finally the tin woodman ventured to ask   and did nimmie amee return your love  not at first admitted the soldier when first i marched into the forest and met her she was weeping over the loss of her former sweetheart a woodman whose name was nick chopper  that is me said the tin woodman  she told me he was nicer than a soldier because he was all made of tin and shone beautifully in the sun she said a tin man appealed to her artistic instincts more than an ordinary meat man as i was then but i did not despair because her tin sweetheart had disappeared and could not be found and finally nimmie amee permitted me to call upon her and we became friends it was then that the wicked witch discovered me and became furiously angry when i said i wanted to marry the girl she enchanted my sword as i said and then my troubles began when i got my tin legs nimmie amee began to take an interest in me when i got my tin arms she began to like me better than ever and when i was all made of tin she said i looked like her dear nick chopper and she would be willing to marry me  the day of our wedding was set and it turned out to be a rainy day nevertheless i started out to get nimmie amee because the witch had been absent for some time and we meant to elope before she got back as i traveled the forest paths the rain wetted my joints but i paid no attention to this because my thoughts were all on my wedding with beautiful nimmie amee and i could think of nothing else until suddenly my legs stopped moving then my arms rusted at the joints and i became frightened and cried for help for now i was unable to oil myself no one heard my calls and before long my jaws rusted and i was unable to utter another sound so i stood helpless in this spot hoping some wanderer would come my way and save me but this forest path is seldom used and i have been standing here so long that i have lost all track of time in my mind i composed poetry and sang songs but not a sound have i been able to utter but this desperate condition has now been relieved by your coming my way and i must thank you for my rescue  this is wonderful said the scarecrow heaving a stuffy long sigh i think ku-klip was wrong to make two tin men just alike and the strangest thing of all is that both you tin men fell in love with the same girl  as for that returned the soldier seriously i must admit i lost my ability to love when i lost my meat heart ku-klip gave me a tin heart to be sure but it doesn't love anything as far as i can discover and merely rattles against my tin ribs which makes me wish i had no heart at all  yet in spite of this condition you were going to marry nimmie amee  well you see i had promised to marry her and i am an honest man and always try to keep my promises i didn't like to disappoint the poor girl who had been disappointed by one tin man already  that was not my fault declared the emperor of the winkies and then he related how he also had rusted in the forest and after a long time had been rescued by dorothy and the scarecrow and had traveled with them to the emerald city in search of a heart that could love  if you have found such a heart sir said the soldier i will gladly allow you to marry nimmie amee in my place  if she loves you best sir answered the woodman i shall not interfere with your wedding her for to be quite frank with you i cannot yet love nimmie amee as i did before i became tin  still one of you ought to marry the poor girl remarked woot and if she likes tin men there is not much choice between you why don't you draw lots for her  that wouldn't be right said the scarecrow  the girl should be permitted to choose her own husband asserted polychrome you should both go to her and allow her to take her choice then she will surely be happy  that to me seems a very fair arrangement said the tin soldier  i agree to it said the tin woodman shaking the hand of his twin to show the matter was settled may i ask your name sir he continued  before i was so cut up replied the other i was known as captain fyter but afterward i was merely called 'the tin soldier'  well captain if you are agreeable let us now go to nimmie amee's house and let her choose between us  very well and if we meet the witch we will both fight her you with your axe and i with my sword  the witch is destroyed announced the scarecrow and as they walked away he told the tin soldier of much that had happened in the land of oz since he had stood rusted in the forest  i must have stood there longer than i had imagined he said thoughtfully     the workshop of ku-klip    chapter 17   it was not more than a two hours' journey to the house where nimmie amee had lived but when our travelers arrived there they found the place deserted the door was partly off its hinges the roof had fallen in at the rear and the interior of the cottage was thick with dust not only was the place vacant but it was evident that no one had lived there for a long time    i suppose said the scarecrow as they all stood looking wonderingly at the ruined house that after the wicked witch was destroyed nimmie amee became lonely and went somewhere else to live  one could scarcely expect a young girl to live all alone in a forest added woot she would want company of course and so i believe she has gone where other people live  and perhaps she is still crying her poor little heart out because no tin man comes to marry her suggested polychrome  well in that case it is the clear duty of you two tin persons to seek nimmie amee until you find her declared the scarecrow  i do not know where to look for the girl said the tin soldier for i am almost a stranger to this part of the country  i was born here said the tin woodman but the forest has few inhabitants except the wild beasts i cannot think of anyone living near here with whom nimmie amee might care to live  why not go to ku-klip and ask him what has become of the girl proposed polychrome  that struck them all as being a good suggestion so once more they started to tramp through the forest taking the direct path to ku-klip's house for both the tin twins knew the way having followed it many times  ku-klip lived at the far edge of the great forest his house facing the broad plains of the munchkin country that lay to the eastward but when they came to this residence by the forest's edge the tinsmith was not at home  it was a pretty place all painted dark blue with trimmings of lighter blue there was a neat blue fence around the yard and several blue benches had been placed underneath the shady blue trees which marked the line between forest and plain there was a blue lawn before the house which was a good sized building ku-klip lived in the front part of the house and had his work-shop in the back part where he had also built a lean-to addition in order to give him more room  although they found the tinsmith absent on their arrival there was smoke coming out of his chimney which proved that he would soon return  and perhaps nimmie amee will be with him said the scarecrow in a cheerful voice  while they waited the tin woodman went to the door of the workshop and finding it unlocked entered and looked curiously around the room where he had been made  it seems almost like home to me he told his friends who had followed him in the first time i came here i had lost a leg so i had to carry it in my hand while i hopped on the other leg all the way from the place in the forest where the enchanted axe cut me i remember that old ku-klip carefully put my meat leg into a barrel i think that is the same barrel still standing in the corner yonder and then at once he began to make a tin leg for me he worked fast and with skill and i was much interested in the job  my experience was much the same said the tin soldier i used to bring all the parts of me which the enchanted sword had cut away here to the tinsmith and ku-klip would put them into the barrel  i wonder said woot if those cast-off parts of you two unfortunates are still in that barrel in the corner  i suppose so replied the tin woodman in the land of oz no part of a living creature can ever be destroyed  if that is true how was that wicked witch destroyed inquired woot  why she was very old and was all dried up and withered before oz became a fairyland explained the scarecrow only her magic arts had kept her alive so long and when dorothy's house fell upon her she just turned to dust and was blown away and scattered by the wind i do not think however that the parts cut away from these two young men could ever be entirely destroyed and if they are still in those barrels they are likely to be just the same as when the enchanted axe or sword severed them  it doesn't matter however said the tin woodman our tin bodies are more brilliant and durable and quite satisfy us  yes the tin bodies are best agreed the tin soldier nothing can hurt them  unless they get dented or rusted said woot but both the tin men frowned on him  scraps of tin of all shapes and sizes lay scattered around the workshop also there were hammers and anvils and soldering irons and a charcoal furnace and many other tools such as a tinsmith works with against two of the side walls had been built stout work-benches and in the center of the room was a long table at the end of the shop which adjoined the dwelling were several cupboards  after examining the interior of the workshop until his curiosity was satisfied woot said   i think i will go outside until ku-klip comes it does not seem quite proper for us to take possession of his house while he is absent  that is true agreed the scarecrow and they were all about to leave the room when the tin woodman said  wait a minute and they halted in obedience to the command       the tin woodman talks to himself    chapter 18   the tin woodman had just noticed the cupboards and was curious to know what they contained so he went to one of them and opened the door there were shelves inside and upon one of the shelves which was about on a level with his tin chin the emperor discovered a head it looked like a doll's head only it was larger and he soon saw it was the head of some person it was facing the tin woodman and as the cupboard door swung back the eyes of the head slowly opened and looked at him the tin woodman was not at all surprised for in the land of oz one runs into magic at every turn  dear me said the tin woodman staring hard it seems as if i had met you somewhere before good morning sir  you have the advantage of me replied the head i never saw you before in my life  still your face is very familiar persisted the tin woodman pardon me but may i ask if you eh eh if you ever had a body  yes at one time answered the head but that is so long ago i can't remember it did you think with a pleasant smile that i was born just as i am that a head would be created without a body  no of course not said the other but how came you to lose your body  well i can't recollect the details you'll have to ask ku-klip about it returned the head for curious as it may seem to you my memory is not good since my separation from the rest of me i still possess my brains and my intellect is as good as ever but my memory of some of the events i formerly experienced is quite hazy    how long have you been in this cupboard asked the emperor  i don't know  haven't you a name  oh yes said the head i used to be called nick chopper when i was a woodman and cut down trees for a living  good gracious cried the tin woodman in astonishment if you are nick chopper's head then you are me or i'm you or or  what relation are we anyhow  don't ask me replied the head for my part i'm not anxious to claim relationship with any common manufactured article like you you may be all right in your class but your class isn't my class you're tin  the poor emperor felt so bewildered that for a time he could only stare at his old head in silence then he said   i must admit that i wasn't at all bad looking before i became tin you're almost handsome for meat if your hair was combed you'd be quite attractive  how do you expect me to comb my hair without help demanded the head indignantly i used to keep it smooth and neat when i had arms but after i was removed from the rest of me my hair got mussed and old ku-klip never has combed it for me  i'll speak to him about it said the tin woodman do you remember loving a pretty munchkin girl named nimmie amee  no answered the head that is a foolish question the heart in my body when i had a body might have loved someone for all i know but a head isn't made to love it's made to think  oh do you think then  i used to think  you must have been shut up in this cupboard for years and years what have you thought about in all that time  nothing that's another foolish question a little reflection will convince you that i have had nothing to think about except the boards on the inside of the cupboard door and it didn't take me long to think of everything about those boards that could be thought of then of course i quit thinking  and are you happy  happy what's that  don't you know what happiness is inquired the tin woodman  i haven't the faintest idea whether it's round or square or black or white or what it is and if you will pardon my lack of interest in it i will say that i don't care  the tin woodman was much puzzled by these answers his traveling companions had grouped themselves at his back and had fixed their eyes on the head and listened to the conversation with much interest but until now they had not interrupted because they thought the tin woodman had the best right to talk to his own head and renew acquaintance with it  but now the tin soldier remarked   i wonder if my old head happens to be in any of these cupboards and he proceeded to open all the cupboard doors but no other head was to be found on any of the shelves  oh well never mind said woot the wanderer i can't imagine what anyone wants of a cast-off head anyhow  i can understand the soldier's interest asserted polychrome dancing around the grimy workshop until her draperies formed a cloud around her dainty form for sentimental reasons a man might like to see his old head once more just as one likes to revisit an old home  and then to kiss it good-bye added the scarecrow  i hope that tin thing won't try to kiss me goodbye exclaimed the tin woodman's former head and i don't see what right you folks have to disturb my peace and comfort either  you belong to me the tin woodman declared  i do not  you and i are one  we've been parted asserted the head it would be unnatural for me to have any interest in a man made of tin please close the door and leave me alone  i did not think that my old head could be so disagreeable said the emperor i i'm quite ashamed of myself meaning you  you ought to be glad that i've enough sense to know what my rights are retorted the head in this cupboard i am leading a simple life peaceful and dignified and when a mob of people in whom i am not interested disturb me they are the disagreeable ones not i  with a sigh the tin woodman closed and latched the cupboard door and turned away  well said the tin soldier if my old head would have treated me as coldly and in so unfriendly a manner as your old head has treated you friend chopper i'm glad i could not find it  yes i'm rather surprised at my head myself replied the tin woodman thoughtfully i thought i had a more pleasant disposition when i was made of meat  but just then old ku-klip the tinsmith arrived and he seemed surprised to find so many visitors ku-klip was a stout man and a short man he had his sleeves rolled above his elbows showing muscular arms and he wore a leathern apron that covered all the front of him and was so long that woot was surprised he didn't step on it and trip whenever he walked and ku-klip had a gray beard that was almost as long as his apron and his head was bald on top and his ears stuck out from his head like two fans over his eyes which were bright and twinkling he wore big spectacles it was easy to see that the tinsmith was a kind hearted man as well as a merry and agreeable one  oh-ho he cried in a joyous bass voice here are both my tin men come to visit me and they and their friends are welcome indeed i'm very proud of you two characters i assure you for you are so perfect that you are proof that i'm a good workman sit down sit down all of you if you can find anything to sit on and tell me why you are here  so they found seats and told him all of their adventures that they thought he would like to know ku-klip was glad to learn that nick chopper the tin woodman was now emperor of the winkies and a friend of ozma of oz and the tinsmith was also interested in the scarecrow and polychrome  he turned the straw man around examining him curiously and patted him on all sides and then said   you are certainly wonderful but i think you would be more durable and steady on your legs if you were made of tin would you like me to   no indeed interrupted the scarecrow hastily i like myself better as i am  but to polychrome the tinsmith said   nothing could improve you my dear for you are the most beautiful maiden i have ever seen it is pure happiness just to look at you    that is praise indeed from so skillful a workman returned the rainbow's daughter laughing and dancing in and out the room  then it must be this boy you wish me to help said ku-klip looking at woot  no said woot we are not here to seek your skill but have merely come to you for information  then between them they related their search for nimmie amee whom the tin woodman explained he had resolved to marry yet who had promised to become the bride of the tin soldier before he unfortunately became rusted and when the story was told they asked ku-klip if he knew what had become of nimmie amee  not exactly replied the old man but i know that she wept bitterly when the tin soldier did not come to marry her as he had promised to do the old witch was so provoked at the girl's tears that she beat nimmie amee with her crooked stick and then hobbled away to gather some magic herbs with which she intended to transform the girl into an old hag so that no one would again love her or care to marry her it was while she was away on this errand that dorothy's house fell on the wicked witch and she turned to dust and blew away when i heard this good news i sent nimmie amee to find the silver shoes which the witch had worn but dorothy had taken them with her to the emerald city    yes we know all about those silver shoes said the scarecrow  well continued ku-klip after that nimmie amee decided to go away from the forest and live with some people she was acquainted with who had a house on mount munch i have never seen the girl since  do you know the name of the people on mount munch with whom she went to live asked the tin woodman  no nimmie amee did not mention her friend's name and i did not ask her she took with her all that she could carry of the goods that were in the witch's house and she told me i could have the rest but when i went there i found nothing worth taking except some magic powders that i did not know how to use and a bottle of magic glue  what is magic glue asked woot  it is a magic preparation with which to mend people when they cut themselves one time long ago i cut off one of my fingers by accident and i carried it to the witch who took down her bottle and glued it on again for me see showing them his finger it is as good as ever it was no one else that i ever heard of had this magic glue and of course when nick chopper cut himself to pieces with his enchanted axe and captain fyter cut himself to pieces with his enchanted sword the witch would not mend them or allow me to glue them together because she had herself wickedly enchanted the axe and sword nothing remained but for me to make them new parts out of tin but as you see tin answered the purpose very well and i am sure their tin bodies are a great improvement on their meat bodies  very true said the tin soldier  i quite agree with you said the tin woodman i happened to find my old head in your cupboard a while ago and certainly it is not as desirable a head as the tin one i now wear  by the way said the tin soldier what ever became of my old head ku-klip  and of the different parts of our bodies added the tin woodman  let me think a minute replied ku-klip if i remember right you two boys used to bring me most of your parts when they were cut off and i saved them in that barrel in the corner you must not have brought me all the parts for when i made chopfyt i had hard work finding enough pieces to complete the job i finally had to finish him with one arm  who is chopfyt inquired woot  oh haven't i told you about chopfyt exclaimed ku-klip of course not and he's quite a curiosity too you'll be interested in hearing about chopfyt this is how he happened   one day after the witch had been destroyed and nimmie amee had gone to live with her friends on mount munch i was looking around the shop for something and came upon the bottle of magic glue which i had brought from the old witch's house it occurred to me to piece together the odds and ends of you two people which of course were just as good as ever and see if i couldn't make a man out of them if i succeeded i would have an assistant to help me with my work and i thought it would be a clever idea to put to some practical use the scraps of nick chopper and captain fyter there were two perfectly good heads in my cupboard and a lot of feet and legs and parts of bodies in the barrel so i set to work to see what i could do  first i pieced together a body gluing it with the witch's magic glue which worked perfectly that was the hardest part of my job however because the bodies didn't match up well and some parts were missing but by using a piece of captain fyter here and a piece of nick chopper there i finally got together a very decent body with heart and all the trimmings complete  whose heart did you use in making the body asked the tin woodman anxiously  [illustration  meat glue]  i can't tell for the parts had no tags on them and one heart looks much like another after the body was completed i glued two fine legs and feet onto it one leg was nick chopper's and one was captain fyter's and finding one leg longer than the other i trimmed it down to make them match i was much disappointed to find that i had but one arm there was an extra leg in the barrel but i could find only one arm having glued this onto the body i was ready for the head and i had some difficulty in making up my mind which head to use finally i shut my eyes and reached out my hand toward the cupboard shelf and the first head i touched i glued upon my new man  it was mine declared the tin soldier gloomily  no it was mine asserted ku-klip for i had given you another in exchange for it the beautiful tin head you now wear when the glue had dried my man was quite an interesting fellow i named him chopfyt using a part of nick chopper's name and a part of captain fyter's name because he was a mixture of both your cast-off parts chopfyt was interesting as i said but he did not prove a very agreeable companion he complained bitterly because i had given him but one arm as if it were my fault and he grumbled because the suit of blue munchkin clothes which i got for him from a neighbor did not fit him perfectly    ah that was because he was wearing my old head remarked the tin soldier i remember that head used to be very particular about its clothes  as an assistant the old tinsmith continued chopfyt was not a success he was awkward with tools and was always hungry he demanded something to eat six or eight times a day so i wondered if i had fitted his insides properly indeed chopfyt ate so much that little food was left for myself so when he proposed one day to go out into the world and seek adventures i was delighted to be rid of him i even made him a tin arm to take the place of the missing one and that pleased him very much so that we parted good friends  what became of chopfyt after that the scarecrow inquired  i never heard he started off toward the east into the plains of the munchkin country and that was the last i ever saw of him  it seems to me said the tin woodman reflectively that you did wrong in making a man out of our cast-off parts it is evident that chopfyt could with justice claim relationship with both of us  don't worry about that advised ku-klip cheerfully it is not likely that you will ever meet the fellow and if you should meet him he doesn't know who he is made of for i never told him the secret of his manufacture indeed you are the only ones who know of it and you may keep the secret to yourselves if you wish to  never mind chopfyt said the scarecrow our business now is to find poor nimmie amee and let her choose her tin husband to do that it seems from the information ku-klip has given us we must travel to mount munch  if that's the programme let us start at once suggested woot  so they all went outside where they found polychrome dancing about among the trees and talking with the birds and laughing as merrily as if she had not lost her rainbow and so been separated from all her fairy sisters  they told her they were going to mount munch and she replied   very well i am as likely to find my rainbow there as here and any other place is as likely as there it all depends on the weather do you think it looks like rain  they shook their heads and polychrome laughed again and danced on after them when they resumed their journey     the invisible country    chapter 19   they were proceeding so easily and comfortably on their way to mount munch that woot said in a serious tone of voice   i'm afraid something is going to happen  why asked polychrome dancing around the group of travelers  because said the boy thoughtfully i've noticed that when we have the least reason for getting into trouble something is sure to go wrong just now the weather is delightful the grass is beautifully blue and quite soft to our feet the mountain we are seeking shows clearly in the distance and there is no reason anything should happen to delay us in getting there our troubles all seem to be over and well that's why i'm afraid he added with a sigh  dear me remarked the scarecrow what unhappy thoughts you have to be sure this is proof that born brains cannot equal manufactured brains for my brains dwell only on facts and never borrow trouble when there is occasion for my brains to think they think but i would be ashamed of my brains if they kept shooting out thoughts that were merely fears and imaginings such as do no good but are likely to do harm  for my part said the tin woodman i do not think at all but allow my velvet heart to guide me at all times  the tinsmith filled my hollow head with scraps and clippings of tin said the soldier and he told me they would do nicely for brains but when i begin to think the tin scraps rattle around and get so mixed that i'm soon bewildered so i try not to think my tin heart is almost as useless to me for it is hard and cold so i'm sure the red velvet heart of my friend nick chopper is a better guide  thoughtless people are not unusual observed the scarecrow but i consider them more fortunate than those who have useless or wicked thoughts and do not try to curb them your oil can friend woodman is filled with oil but you only apply the oil to your joints drop by drop as you need it and do not keep spilling it where it will do no good thoughts should be restrained in the same way as your oil and only applied when necessary and for a good purpose if used carefully thoughts are good things to have  polychrome laughed at him for the rainbow's daughter knew more about thoughts than the scarecrow did but the others were solemn feeling they had been rebuked and tramped on in silence  suddenly woot who was in the lead looked around and found that all his comrades had mysteriously disappeared but where could they have gone to the broad plain was all about him and there were neither trees nor bushes that could hide even a rabbit nor any hole for one to fall into yet there he stood alone  surprise had caused him to halt and with a thoughtful and puzzled expression on his face he looked down at his feet it startled him anew to discover that he had no feet he reached out his hands but he could not see them he could feel his hands and arms and body he stamped his feet on the grass and knew they were there but in some strange way they had become invisible  while woot stood wondering a crash of metal sounded in his ears and he heard two heavy bodies tumble to the earth just beside him  good gracious exclaimed the voice of the tin woodman  mercy me cried the voice of the tin soldier  why didn't you look where you were going asked the tin woodman reproachfully  i did but i couldn't see you said the tin soldier something has happened to my tin eyes i can't see you even now nor can i see anyone else  it's the same way with me admitted the tin woodman    woot couldn't see either of them although he heard them plainly and just then something smashed against him unexpectedly and knocked him over but it was only the straw-stuffed body of the scarecrow that fell upon him and while he could not see the scarecrow he managed to push him off and rose to his feet just as polychrome whirled against him and made him tumble again  sitting upon the ground the boy asked   can you see us poly  no indeed answered the rainbow's daughter we've all become invisible  how did it happen do you suppose inquired the scarecrow lying where he had fallen  we have met with no enemy answered polychrome so it must be that this part of the country has the magic quality of making people invisible even fairies falling under the charm we can see the grass and the flowers and the stretch of plain before us and we can still see mount munch in the distance but we cannot see ourselves or one another  well what are we to do about it demanded woot  i think this magic affects only a small part of the plain replied polychrome perhaps there is only a streak of the country where an enchantment makes people become invisible so if we get together and hold hands we can travel toward mount munch until the enchanted streak is passed  all right said woot jumping up give me your hand polychrome where are you  here she answered whistle woot and keep whistling until i come to you  so woot whistled and presently polychrome found him and grasped his hand  someone must help me up said the scarecrow lying near them so they found the straw man and sat him upon his feet after which he held fast to polychrome's other hand  nick chopper and the tin soldier had managed to scramble up without assistance but it was awkward for them and the tin woodman said   i don't seem to stand straight somehow but my joints all work so i guess i can walk  guided by his voice they reached his side where woot grasped his tin fingers so they might keep together  the tin soldier was standing near by and the scarecrow soon touched him and took hold of his arm  i hope you're not wobbly said the straw man for if two of us walk unsteadily we will be sure to fall  i'm not wobbly the tin soldier assured him but i'm certain that one of my legs is shorter than the other i can't see it to tell what's gone wrong but i'll limp on with the rest of you until we are out of this enchanted territory  they now formed a line holding hands and turning their faces toward mount munch resumed their journey they had not gone far however when a terrible growl saluted their ears the sound seemed to come from a place just in front of them so they halted abruptly and remained silent listening with all their ears  i smell straw cried a hoarse harsh voice with more growls and snarls i smell straw and i'm a hip-po-gy-raf who loves straw and eats all he can find i want to eat this straw where is it where is it  the scarecrow hearing this trembled but kept silent all the others were silent too hoping that the invisible beast would be unable to find them but the creature sniffed the odor of the straw and drew nearer and nearer to them until he reached the tin woodman on one end of the line it was a big beast and it smelled of the tin woodman and grated two rows of enormous teeth against the emperor's tin body  bah that's not straw said the harsh voice and the beast advanced along the line to woot  meat pooh you're no good i can't eat meat grumbled the beast and passed on to polychrome  sweetmeats and perfume cobwebs and dew nothing to eat in a fairy like you said the creature  now the scarecrow was next to polychrome in the line and he realized if the beast devoured his straw he would be helpless for a long time because the last farmhouse was far behind them and only grass covered the vast expanse of plain so in his fright he let go of polychrome's hand and put the hand of the tin soldier in that of the rainbow's daughter then he slipped back of the line and went to the other end where he silently seized the tin woodman's hand  meantime the beast had smelled the tin soldier and found he was the last of the line  that's funny growled the hip-po-gy-raf i can smell straw but i can't find it well it's here somewhere and i must hunt around until i do find it for i'm hungry  his voice was now at the left of them so they started on hoping to avoid him and traveled as fast as they could in the direction of mount munch  i don't like this invisible country said woot with a shudder we can't tell how many dreadful invisible beasts are roaming around us or what danger we'll come to next  quit thinking about danger please said the scarecrow warningly  why asked the boy  if you think of some dreadful thing it's liable to happen but if you don't think of it and no one else thinks of it it just can't happen do you see  no answered woot i won't be able to see much of anything until we escape from this enchantment  but they got out of the invisible strip of country as suddenly as they had entered it and the instant they got out they stopped short for just before them was a deep ditch running at right angles as far as their eyes could see and stopping all further progress toward mount munch  it's not so very wide said woot but i'm sure none of us can jump across it  polychrome began to laugh and the scarecrow said  what's the matter  look at the tin men she said with another burst of merry laughter  woot and the scarecrow looked and the tin men looked at themselves  it was the collision said the tin woodman regretfully i knew something was wrong with me and now i can see that my side is dented in so that i lean over toward the left it was the soldier's fault he shouldn't have been so careless  it is your fault that my right leg is bent making it shorter than the other so that i limp badly retorted the soldier you shouldn't have stood where i was walking  you shouldn't have walked where i was standing replied the tin woodman  it was almost a quarrel so polychrome said soothingly   never mind friends as soon as we have time i am sure we can straighten the soldier's leg and get the dent out of the woodman's body the scarecrow needs patting into shape too for he had a bad tumble but our first task is to get over this ditch  yes the ditch is the most important thing just now added woot  they were standing in a row looking hard at the unexpected barrier when a fierce growl from behind them made them all turn quickly out of the invisible country marched a huge beast with a thick leathery skin and a surprisingly long neck the head on the top of this neck was broad and flat and the eyes and mouth were very big and the nose and ears very small when the head was drawn down toward the beast's shoulders the neck was all wrinkles but the head could shoot up very high indeed if the creature wished it to  dear me exclaimed the scarecrow this must be the hip-po-gy-raf  quite right said the beast and you're the straw which i'm to eat for my dinner oh how i love straw i hope you don't resent my affectionate appetite  with its four great legs it advanced straight toward the scarecrow but the tin woodman and the tin soldier both sprang in front of their friend and flourished their weapons  keep off said the tin woodman warningly or i'll chop you with my axe  keep off said the tin soldier or i'll cut you with my sword  would you really do that asked the hip-po-gy-raf in a disappointed voice      we would they both replied and the tin woodman added  the scarecrow is our friend and he would be useless without his straw stuffing so as we are comrades faithful and true we will defend our friend's stuffing against all enemies  the hip-po-gy-raf sat down and looked at them sorrowfully  when one has made up his mind to have a meal of delicious straw and then finds he can't have it it is certainly hard luck he said and what good is the straw man to you or to himself when the ditch keeps you from going any further  well we can go back again suggested woot  true said the hip-po and if you do you'll be as disappointed as i am that's some comfort anyhow  the travelers looked at the beast and then they looked across the ditch at the level plain beyond on the other side the grass had grown tall and the sun had dried it so there was a fine crop of hay that only needed to be cut and stacked  why don't you cross over and eat hay the boy asked the beast  i'm not fond of hay replied the hip-po-gy-raf straw is much more delicious to my notion and it's more scarce in this neighborhood too also i must confess that i can't get across the ditch for my body is too heavy and clumsy for me to jump the distance i can stretch my neck across though and you will notice that i've nibbled the hay on the farther edge not because i liked it but because one must eat and if one can't get the sort of food he desires he must take what is offered or go hungry  ah i see you are a philosopher remarked the scarecrow  no i'm just a hip-po-gy-raf was the reply  polychrome was not afraid of the big beast she danced close to him and said   if you can stretch your neck across the ditch why not help us over we can sit on your big head one at a time and then you can lift us across  yes i can it is true answered the hip-po but i refuse to do it unless  he added and stopped short  unless what asked polychrome  unless you first allow me to eat the straw with which the scarecrow is stuffed  no said the rainbow's daughter that is too high a price to pay our friend's straw is nice and fresh for he was restuffed only a little while ago  i know agreed the hip-po-gy-raf that's why i want it if it was old musty straw i wouldn't care for it  please lift us across pleaded polychrome  no replied the beast since you refuse my generous offer i can be as stubborn as you are  after that they were all silent for a time but then the scarecrow said bravely   friends let us agree to the beast's terms give him my straw and carry the rest of me with you across the ditch once on the other side the tin soldier can cut some of the hay with his sharp sword and you can stuff me with that material until we reach a place where there is straw it is true i have been stuffed with straw all my life and it will be somewhat humiliating to be filled with common hay but i am willing to sacrifice my pride in a good cause moreover to abandon our errand and so deprive the great emperor of the winkies or this noble soldier of his bride would be equally humiliating if not more so  you're a very honest and clever man exclaimed the hip-po-gy-raf admiringly when i have eaten your head perhaps i also will become clever  you're not to eat my head you know returned the scarecrow hastily my head isn't stuffed with straw and i cannot part with it when one loses his head he loses his brains  very well then you may keep your head said the beast  the scarecrow's companions thanked him warmly for his loyal sacrifice to their mutual good and then he laid down and permitted them to pull the straw from his body as fast as they did this the hip-po-gy-raf ate up the straw and when all was consumed polychrome made a neat bundle of the clothes and boots and gloves and hat and said she would carry them while woot tucked the scarecrow's head under his arm and promised to guard its safety  now then said the tin woodman keep your promise beast and lift us over the ditch  m-m-m-mum but that was a fine dinner said the hip-po smacking his thick lips in satisfaction and i'm as good as my word sit on my head one at a time and i'll land you safely on the other side  he approached close to the edge of the ditch and squatted down polychrome climbed over his big body and sat herself lightly upon the flat head holding the bundle of the scarecrow's raiment in her hand slowly the elastic neck stretched out until it reached the far side of the ditch when the beast lowered his head and permitted the beautiful fairy to leap to the ground  woot made the queer journey next and then the tin soldier and the tin woodman went over and all were well pleased to have overcome this serious barrier to their progress  now soldier cut the hay said the scarecrow's head which was still held by woot the wanderer  i'd like to but i can't stoop over with my bent leg without falling replied captain fyter  what can we do about that leg anyhow asked woot appealing to polychrome  she danced around in a circle several times without replying and the boy feared she had not heard him but the rainbow's daughter was merely thinking upon the problem and presently she paused beside the tin soldier and said   i've been taught a little fairy magic but i've never before been asked to mend tin legs with it so i'm not sure i can help you it all depends on the good will of my unseen fairy guardians so i'll try and if i fail you will be no worse off than you are now    she danced around the circle again and then laid both hands upon the twisted tin leg and sang in her sweet voice       fairy powers come to my aid     this bent leg of tin is made     make it straight and strong and true     and i'll render thanks to you  ah murmured captain fyter in a glad voice as she withdrew her hands and danced away and they saw he was standing straight as ever because his leg was as shapely and strong as it had been before his accident  the tin woodman had watched polychrome with much interest and he now said   please take the dent out of my side poly for i am more crippled than was the soldier  so the rainbow's daughter touched his side lightly and sang       here's a dent by accident     such a thing was never meant     fairy powers so wondrous great     make our dear tin woodman straight  good cried the emperor again standing erect and strutting around to show his fine figure your fairy magic may not be able to accomplish all things sweet polychrome but it works splendidly on tin thank you very much  the hay the hay pleaded the scarecrow's head  oh yes the hay said woot what are you waiting for captain fyter  at once the tin soldier set to work cutting hay with his sword and in a few minutes there was quite enough with which to stuff the scarecrow's body woot and polychrome did this and it was no easy task because the hay packed together more than straw and as they had little experience in such work their job when completed left the scarecrow's arms and legs rather bunchy also there was a hump on his back which made woot laugh and say it reminded him of a camel but it was the best they could do and when the head was fastened on to the body they asked the scarecrow how he felt  a little heavy and not quite natural he cheerfully replied but i'll get along somehow until we reach a straw-stack don't laugh at me please because i'm a little ashamed of myself and i don't want to regret a good action  they started at once in the direction of mount munch and as the scarecrow proved very clumsy in his movements woot took one of his arms and the tin woodman the other and so helped their friend to walk in a straight line  and the rainbow's daughter as before danced ahead of them and behind them and all around them and they never minded her odd ways because to them she was like a ray of sunshine       over night    chapter 20   the land of the munchkins is full of surprises as our travelers had already learned and although mount munch was constantly growing larger as they advanced toward it they knew it was still a long way off and were not certain by any means that they had escaped all danger or encountered their last adventure  the plain was broad and as far as the eye could see there seemed to be a level stretch of country between them and the mountain but toward evening they came upon a hollow in which stood a tiny blue munchkin dwelling with a garden around it and fields of grain filling in all the rest of the hollow  they did not discover this place until they came close to the edge of it and they were astonished at the sight that greeted them because they had imagined that this part of the plain had no inhabitants  it's a very small house woot declared i wonder who lives there  the way to find out is to knock on the door and ask replied the tin woodman perhaps it is the home of nimmie amee  is she a dwarf asked the boy  no indeed nimmie amee is a full sized woman  then i'm sure she couldn't live in that little house said woot  let's go down suggested the scarecrow i'm almost sure i can see a straw-stack in the back yard  they descended the hollow which was rather steep at the sides and soon came to the house which was indeed rather small woot knocked upon a door that was not much higher than his waist but got no reply he knocked again but not a sound was heard  smoke is coming out of the chimney announced polychrome who was dancing lightly through the garden where cabbages and beets and turnips and the like were growing finely  then someone surely lives here said woot and knocked again  now a window at the side of the house opened and a queer head appeared it was white and hairy and had a long snout and little round eyes the ears were hidden by a blue sunbonnet tied under the chin  oh it's a pig exclaimed woot  pardon me i am mrs squealina swyne wife of professor grunter swyne and this is our home said the one in the window what do you want  what sort of a professor is your husband inquired the tin woodman curiously  he is professor of cabbage culture and corn perfection he is very famous in his own family and would be the wonder of the world if he went abroad said mrs swyne in a voice that was half proud and half irritable i must also inform you intruders that the professor is a dangerous individual for he files his teeth every morning until they are sharp as needles if you are butchers you'd better run away and avoid trouble  we are not butchers the tin woodman assured her  then what are you doing with that axe and why has the other tin man a sword  they are the only weapons we have to defend our friends from their enemies explained the emperor of the winkies and woot added   do not be afraid of us mrs swyne for we are harmless travelers the tin men and the scarecrow never eat anything and polychrome feasts only on dewdrops as for me i'm rather hungry but there is plenty of food in your garden to satisfy me  professor swyne now joined his wife at the window looking rather scared in spite of the boy's assuring speech he wore a blue munchkin hat with pointed crown and broad brim and big spectacles covered his eyes he peeked around from behind his wife and after looking hard at the strangers he said   my wisdom assures me that you are merely travelers as you say and not butchers butchers have reason to be afraid of me but you are safe we cannot invite you in for you are too big for our house but the boy who eats is welcome to all the carrots and turnips he wants make yourselves at home in the garden and stay all night if you like but in the morning you must go away for we are quiet people and do not care for company  may i have some of your straw asked the scarecrow  help yourself replied professor swyne  for pigs they're quite respectable remarked woot as they all went toward the straw-stack  i'm glad they didn't invite us in said captain fyter i hope i'm not too particular about my associates but i draw the line at pigs  the scarecrow was glad to be rid of his hay for during the long walk it had sagged down and made him fat and squatty and more bumpy than at first  i'm not specially proud he said but i love a manly figure such as only straw stuffing can create i've not felt like myself since that hungry hip-po ate my last straw  polychrome and woot set to work removing the hay and then they selected the finest straw crisp and golden and with it stuffed the scarecrow anew he certainly looked better after the operation and he was so pleased at being reformed that he tried to dance a little jig and almost succeeded    i shall sleep under the straw-stack tonight woot decided after he had eaten some of the vegetables from the garden and in fact he slept very well with the two tin men and the scarecrow sitting silently beside him and polychrome away somewhere in the moonlight dancing her fairy dances  at daybreak the tin woodman and the tin soldier took occasion to polish their bodies and oil their joints for both were exceedingly careful of their personal appearance they had forgotten the quarrel due to their accidental bumping of one another in the invisible country and being now good friends the tin woodman polished the tin soldier's back for him and then the tin soldier polished the tin woodman's back  for breakfast the wanderer ate crisp lettuce and radishes and the rainbow's daughter who had now returned to her friends sipped the dewdrops that had formed on the petals of the wild-flowers  as they passed the little house to renew their journey woot called out   good-bye mr and mrs swyne  the window opened and the two pigs looked out  a pleasant journey said the professor  have you any children asked the scarecrow who was a great friend of children  we have nine answered the professor but they do not live with us for when they were tiny piglets the wizard of oz came here and offered to care for them and to educate them so we let him have our nine tiny piglets for he's a good wizard and can be relied upon to keep his promises  i know the nine tiny piglets said the tin woodman  so do i said the scarecrow they still live in the emerald city and the wizard takes good care of them and teaches them to do all sorts of tricks  did they ever grow up inquired mrs squealina swyne in an anxious voice  no answered the scarecrow like all other children in the land of oz they will always remain children and in the case of the tiny piglets that is a good thing because they would not be nearly so cute and cunning if they were bigger  but are they happy asked mrs swyne  everyone in the emerald city is happy said the tin woodman they can't help it  then the travelers said good-bye and climbed the side of the basin that was toward mount munch     polychrome's magic    chapter 21   on this morning which ought to be the last of this important journey our friends started away as bright and cheery as could be and woot whistled a merry tune so that polychrome could dance to the music  on reaching the top of the hill the plain spread out before them in all its beauty of blue grasses and wildflowers and mount munch seemed much nearer than it had the previous evening they trudged on at a brisk pace and by noon the mountain was so close that they could admire its appearance its slopes were partly clothed with pretty evergreens and its foot-hills were tufted with a slender waving bluegrass that had a tassel on the end of every blade and for the first time they perceived near the foot of the mountain a charming house not of great size but neatly painted and with many flowers surrounding it and vines climbing over the doors and windows  it was toward this solitary house that our travelers now directed their steps thinking to inquire of the people who lived there where nimmie amee might be found  there were no paths but the way was quite open and clear and they were drawing near to the dwelling when woot the wanderer who was then in the lead of the little party halted with such an abrupt jerk that he stumbled over backward and lay flat on his back in the meadow the scarecrow stopped to look at the boy  why did you do that he asked in surprise  woot sat up and gazed around him in amazement  i i don't know he replied  the two tin men arm in arm started to pass them when both halted and tumbled with a great clatter into a heap beside woot polychrome laughing at the absurd sight came dancing up and she also came to a sudden stop but managed to save herself from falling  everyone of them was much astonished and the scarecrow said with a puzzled look   i don't see anything  nor i said woot but something hit me just the same  some invisible person struck me a heavy blow declared the tin woodman struggling to separate himself from the tin soldier whose legs and arms were mixed with his own  i'm not sure it was a person said polychrome looking more grave than usual it seems to me that i merely ran into some hard substance which barred my way in order to make sure of this let me try another place  she ran back a way and then with much caution advanced in a different place but when she reached a position on a line with the others she halted her arms outstretched before her    i can feel something hard something smooth as glass she said but i'm sure it is not glass  let me try suggested woot getting up but when he tried to go forward he discovered the same barrier that polychrome had encountered  no he said it isn't glass but what is it  air replied a small voice beside him solid air that's all  they all looked downward and found a sky-blue rabbit had stuck his head out of a burrow in the ground the rabbit's eyes were a deeper blue than his fur and the pretty creature seemed friendly and unafraid  air exclaimed woot staring in astonishment into the rabbit's blue eyes whoever heard of air so solid that one cannot push it aside  you can't push this air aside declared the rabbit for it was made hard by powerful sorcery and it forms a wall that is intended to keep people from getting to that house yonder  oh it's a wall is it said the tin woodman  yes it is really a wall answered the rabbit and it is fully six feet thick  how high is it inquired captain fyter the tin soldier  oh ever so high perhaps a mile said the rabbit  couldn't we go around it asked woot  of course for the wall is a circle explained the rabbit in the center of the circle stands the house so you may walk around the wall of solid air but you can't get to the house  who put the air wall around the house was the scarecrow's question  nimmie amee did that  nimmie amee they all exclaimed in surprise  yes answered the rabbit she used to live with an old witch who was suddenly destroyed and when nimmie amee ran away from the witch's house she took with her just one magic formula pure sorcery it was which enabled her to build this air wall around her house the house yonder it was quite a clever idea i think for it doesn't mar the beauty of the landscape solid air being invisible and yet it keeps all strangers away from the house  does nimmie amee live there now asked the tin woodman anxiously  yes indeed said the rabbit  and does she weep and wail from morning till night continued the emperor  no she seems quite happy asserted the rabbit  the tin woodman seemed quite disappointed to hear this report of his old sweetheart but the scarecrow reassured his friend saying     never mind your majesty however happy nimmie amee is now i'm sure she will be much happier as empress of the winkies  perhaps said captain fyter somewhat stiffly she will be still more happy to become the bride of a tin soldier  she shall choose between us as we have agreed the tin woodman promised but how shall we get to the poor girl  polychrome although dancing lightly back and forth had listened to every word of the conversation now she came forward and sat herself down just in front of the blue rabbit her many-hued draperies giving her the appearance of some beautiful flower the rabbit didn't back away an inch instead he gazed at the rainbow's daughter admiringly  does your burrow go underneath this wall of air asked polychrome  to be sure answered the blue rabbit i dug it that way so i could roam in these broad fields by going out one way or eat the cabbages in nimmie amee's garden by leaving my burrow at the other end i don't think nimmie amee ought to mind the little i take from her garden or the hole i've made under her magic wall a rabbit may go and come as he pleases but no one who is bigger than i am could get through my burrow  will you allow us to pass through it if we are able to inquired polychrome  yes indeed answered the blue rabbit i'm no especial friend of nimmie amee for once she threw stones at me just because i was nibbling some lettuce and only yesterday she yelled 'shoo' at me which made me nervous you're welcome to use my burrow in any way you choose  but this is all nonsense declared woot the wanderer we are every one too big to crawl through a rabbit's burrow  we are too big now agreed the scarecrow but you must remember that polychrome is a fairy and fairies have many magic powers  woot's face brightened as he turned to the lovely daughter of the rainbow  could you make us all as small as that rabbit he asked eagerly  i can try answered polychrome with a smile  and presently she did it so easily that woot was not the only one astonished as the now tiny people grouped themselves before the rabbit's burrow the hole appeared to them like the entrance to a tunnel which indeed it was  i'll go first said wee polychrome who had made herself grow as small as the others and into the tunnel she danced without hesitation a tiny scarecrow went next and then the two funny little tin men  walk in it's your turn said the blue rabbit to woot the wanderer i'm coming after to see how you get along this will be a regular surprise party to nimmie amee  so woot entered the hole and felt his way along its smooth sides in the dark until he finally saw the glimmer of daylight ahead and knew the journey was almost over had he remained his natural size the distance could have been covered in a few steps but to a thumb-high woot it was quite a promenade when he emerged from the burrow he found himself but a short distance from the house in the center of the vegetable garden where the leaves of rhubarb waving above his head seemed like trees outside the hole and waiting for him he found all his friends  so far so good remarked the scarecrow cheerfully  yes so far but no farther returned the tin woodman in a plaintive and disturbed tone of voice i am now close to nimmie amee whom i have come ever so far to seek but i cannot ask the girl to marry such a little man as i am now  i'm no bigger than a toy soldier said captain fyter sorrowfully unless polychrome can make us big again there is little use in our visiting nimmie amee at all for i'm sure she wouldn't care for a husband she might carelessly step on and ruin  polychrome laughed merrily  if i make you big you can't get out of here again said she and if you remain little nimmie amee will laugh at you so make your choice  i think we'd better go back said woot seriously  no said the tin woodman stoutly i have decided that it's my duty to make nimmie amee happy in case she wishes to marry me  so have i announced captain fyter a good soldier never shrinks from doing his duty  as for that said the scarecrow tin doesn't shrink any to speak of under any circumstances but woot and i intend to stick to our comrades whatever they decide to do so we will ask polychrome to make us as big as we were before  polychrome agreed to this request and in half a minute all of them including herself had been enlarged again to their natural sizes they then thanked the blue rabbit for his kind assistance and at once approached the house of nimmie amee     nimmie amee    chapter 22   we may be sure that at this moment our friends were all anxious to see the end of the adventure that had caused them so many trials and troubles perhaps the tin woodman's heart did not beat any faster because it was made of red velvet and stuffed with sawdust and the tin soldier's heart was made of tin and reposed in his tin bosom without a hint of emotion however there is little doubt that they both knew that a critical moment in their lives had arrived and that nimmie amee's decision was destined to influence the future of one or the other  as they assumed their natural sizes and the rhubarb leaves that had before towered above their heads now barely covered their feet they looked around the garden and found that no person was visible save themselves no sound of activity came from the house either but they walked to the front door which had a little porch built before it and there the two tinmen stood side by side while both knocked upon the door with their tin knuckles  as no one seemed eager to answer the summons they knocked again and then again finally they heard a stir from within and someone coughed  who's there called a girl's voice  it's i cried the tin twins together  how did you get there asked the voice  they hesitated how to reply so woot answered for them   by means of magic  oh said the unseen girl are you friends or foes  friends they all exclaimed  then they heard footsteps approach the door which slowly opened and revealed a very pretty munchkin girl standing in the doorway  nimmie amee cried the tin twins  that's my name replied the girl looking at them in cold surprise but who can you be  don't you know me nimmie said the tin woodman i'm your old sweetheart nick chopper  don't you know me my dear said the tin soldier i'm your old sweetheart captain fyter  nimmie amee smiled at them both then she looked beyond them at the rest of the party and smiled again however she seemed more amused than pleased  come in she said leading the way inside even sweethearts are forgotten after a time but you and your friends are welcome  the room they now entered was cosy and comfortable being neatly furnished and well swept and dusted but they found someone there besides nimmie amee a man dressed in the attractive munchkin costume was lazily reclining in an easy chair and he sat up and turned his eyes on the visitors with a cold and indifferent stare that was almost insolent he did not even rise from his seat to greet the strangers but after glaring at them he looked away with a scowl as if they were of too little importance to interest him  the tin men returned this man's stare with interest but they did not look away from him because neither of them seemed able to take his eyes off this munchkin who was remarkable in having one tin arm quite like their own tin arms  seems to me said captain fyter in a voice that sounded harsh and indignant that you sir are a vile impostor  gently gently cautioned the scarecrow don't be rude to strangers captain  rude shouted the tin soldier now very much provoked why he's a scoundrel a thief the villain is wearing my own head  yes added the tin woodman and he's wearing my right arm i can recognize it by the two warts on the little finger  good gracious exclaimed woot then this must be the man whom old ku-klip patched together and named chopfyt  the man now turned toward them still scowling    yes that is my name he said in a voice like a growl and it is absurd for you tin creatures or for anyone else to claim my head or arm or any part of me for they are my personal property  you you're a nobody shouted captain fyter    you're just a mix-up declared the emperor  now now gentlemen interrupted nimmie amee i must ask you to be more respectful to poor chopfyt for being my guests it is not polite for you to insult my husband  your husband the tin twins exclaimed in dismay  yes said she i married chopfyt a long time ago because my other two sweethearts had deserted me  this reproof embarrassed both nick chopper and captain fyter they looked down shamefaced for a moment and then the tin woodman explained in an earnest voice   i rusted  so did i said the tin soldier  i could not know that of course asserted nimmie amee all i knew was that neither of you came to marry me as you had promised to do but men are not scarce in the land of oz after i came here to live i met mr chopfyt and he was the more interesting because he reminded me strongly of both of you as you were before you became tin he even had a tin arm and that reminded me of you the more  no wonder remarked the scarecrow  but listen nimmie amee said the astonished woot he really is both of them for he is made of their cast-off parts  oh you're quite wrong declared polychrome laughing for she was greatly enjoying the confusion of the others the tin men are still themselves as they will tell you and so chopfyt must be someone else  they looked at her bewildered for the facts in the case were too puzzling to be grasped at once  it is all the fault of old ku-klip muttered the tin woodman he had no right to use our cast-off parts to make another man with  it seems he did it however said nimmie amee calmly and i married him because he resembled you both i won't say he is a husband to be proud of because he has a mixed nature and isn't always an agreeable companion there are times when i have to chide him gently both with my tongue and with my broomstick but he is my husband and i must make the best of him  if you don't like him suggested the tin woodman captain fyter and i can chop him up with our axe and sword and each take such parts of the fellow as belong to him then we are willing for you to select one of us as your husband  that is a good idea approved captain fyter drawing his sword  no said nimmie amee i think i'll keep the husband i now have he is now trained to draw the water and carry in the wood and hoe the cabbages and weed the flower-beds and dust the furniture and perform many tasks of a like character a new husband would have to be scolded and gently chided until he learns my ways so i think it will be better to keep my chopfyt and i see no reason why you should object to him you two gentlemen threw him away when you became tin because you had no further use for him so you cannot justly claim him now i advise you to go back to your own homes and forget me as i have forgotten you  good advice laughed polychrome dancing  are you happy asked the tin soldier  of course i am said nimmie amee i'm the mistress of all i survey the queen of my little domain  wouldn't you like to be the empress of the winkies asked the tin woodman  mercy no she answered that would be a lot of bother i don't care for society or pomp or posing all i ask is to be left alone and not to be annoyed by visitors  the scarecrow nudged woot the wanderer  that sounds to me like a hint he said  looks as if we'd had our journey for nothing remarked woot who was a little ashamed and disappointed because he had proposed the journey  i am glad however said the tin woodman that i have found nimmie amee and discovered that she is already married and happy it will relieve me of any further anxiety concerning her  for my part said the tin soldier i am not sorry to be free the only thing that really annoys me is finding my head upon chopfyt's body  as for that i'm pretty sure it is my body or a part of it anyway remarked the emperor of the winkies but never mind friend soldier let us be willing to donate our cast-off members to insure the happiness of nimmie amee and be thankful it is not our fate to hoe cabbages and draw water and be chided in the place of this creature chopfyt  yes agreed the soldier we have much to be thankful for  polychrome who had wandered outside now poked her pretty head through an open window and exclaimed in a pleased voice   it's getting cloudy perhaps it is going to rain     through the tunnel    chapter 23   it didn't rain just then although the clouds in the sky grew thicker and more threatening polychrome hoped for a thunder-storm followed by her rainbow but the two tin men did not relish the idea of getting wet they even preferred to remain in nimmie amee's house although they felt they were not welcome there rather than go out and face the coming storm but the scarecrow who was a very thoughtful person said to his friends   if we remain here until after the storm and polychrome goes away on her rainbow then we will be prisoners inside the wall of solid air so it seems best to start upon our return journey at once if i get wet my straw stuffing will be ruined and if you two tin gentlemen get wet you may perhaps rust again and become useless but even that is better than to stay here once we are free of the barrier we have woot the wanderer to help us and he can oil your joints and restuff my body if it becomes necessary for the boy is made of meat which neither rusts nor gets soggy or moldy  come along then cried polychrome from the window and the others realizing the wisdom of the scarecrow's speech took leave of nimmie amee who was glad to be rid of them and said good-bye to her husband who merely scowled and made no answer and then they hurried from the house  your old parts are not very polite i must say remarked the scarecrow when they were in the garden  no said woot chopfyt is a regular grouch he might have wished us a pleasant journey at the very least  i beg you not to hold us responsible for that creature's actions pleaded the tin woodman we are through with chopfyt and shall have nothing further to do with him  polychrome danced ahead of the party and led them straight to the burrow of the blue rabbit which they might have had some difficulty in finding without her there she lost no time in making them all small again the blue rabbit was busy nibbling cabbage leaves in nimmie amee's garden so they did not ask his permission but at once entered the burrow  even now the raindrops were beginning to fall but it was quite dry inside the tunnel and by the time they had reached the other end outside the circular wall of solid air the storm was at its height and the rain was coming down in torrents  let us wait here proposed polychrome peering out of the hole and then quickly retreating the rainbow won't appear until after the storm and i can make you big again in a jiffy before i join my sisters on our bow  that's a good plan said the scarecrow approvingly it will save me from getting soaked and soggy  it will save me from rusting said the tin soldier  it will enable me to remain highly polished said the tin woodman  oh as for that i myself prefer not to get my pretty clothes wet laughed the rainbow's daughter but while we wait i will bid you all adieu i must also thank you for saving me from that dreadful giantess mrs yoop you have been good and patient comrades and i have enjoyed our adventures together but i am never so happy as when on my dear rainbow  will your father scold you for getting left on the earth asked woot  i suppose so said polychrome gaily i'm always getting scolded for my mad pranks as they are called my sisters are so sweet and lovely and proper that they never dance off our rainbow and so they never have any adventures adventures to me are good fun only i never like to stay too long on earth because i really don't belong here i shall tell my father the rainbow that i'll try not to be so careless again and he will forgive me because in our sky mansions there is always joy and happiness  they were indeed sorry to part with their dainty and beautiful companion and assured her of their devotion if they ever chanced to meet again she shook hands with the scarecrow and the tin men and kissed woot the wanderer lightly upon his forehead  and then the rain suddenly ceased and as the tiny people left the burrow of the blue rabbit a glorious big rainbow appeared in the sky and the end of its arch slowly descended and touched the ground just where they stood  woot was so busy watching a score of lovely maidens sisters of polychrome who were leaning over the edge of the bow and another score who danced gaily amid the radiance of the splendid hues that he did not notice he was growing big again but now polychrome joined her sisters on the rainbow and the huge arch lifted and slowly melted away as the sun burst from the clouds and sent its own white beams dancing over the meadows  why she's gone exclaimed the boy and turned to see his companions still waving their hands in token of adieu to the vanished polychrome       the curtain falls    chapter 24   well the rest of the story is quickly told for the return journey of our adventurers was without any important incident the scarecrow was so afraid of meeting the hip-po-gy-raf and having his straw eaten again that he urged his comrades to select another route to the emerald city and they willingly consented so that the invisible country was wholly avoided  of course when they reached the emerald city their first duty was to visit ozma's palace where they were royally entertained the tin soldier and woot the wanderer were welcomed as warmly as any strangers might be who had been the traveling companions of ozma's dear old friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman  at the banquet table that evening they related the manner in which they had discovered nimmie amee and told how they had found her happily married to chopfyt whose relationship to nick chopper and captain fyter was so bewildering that they asked ozma's advice what to do about it  you need not consider chopfyt at all replied the beautiful girl ruler of oz if nimmie amee is content with that misfit man for a husband we have not even just cause to blame ku-klip for gluing him together  i think it was a very good idea added little dorothy for if ku-klip hadn't used up your cast-off parts they would have been wasted it's wicked to be wasteful isn't it  well anyhow said woot the wanderer chopfyt being kept a prisoner by his wife is too far away from anyone to bother either of you tin men in any way if you hadn't gone where he is and discovered him you would never have worried about him  what do you care anyhow betsy bobbin asked the tin woodman so long as nimmie amee is satisfied  and just to think remarked tiny trot that any girl would rather live with a mixture like chopfyt on far-away mount munch than to be the empress of the winkies  it is her own choice said the tin woodman contentedly and after all i'm not sure the winkies would care to have an empress  it puzzled ozma for a time to decide what to do with the tin soldier if he went with the tin woodman to the emperor's castle she felt that the two tin men might not be able to live together in harmony and moreover the emperor would not be so distinguished if he had a double constantly beside him so she asked captain fyter if he was willing to serve her as a soldier and he promptly declared that nothing would please him more after he had been in her service for some time ozma sent him into the gillikin country with instructions to keep order among the wild people who inhabit some parts of that unknown country of oz  as for woot being a wanderer by profession he was allowed to wander wherever he desired and ozma promised to keep watch over his future journeys and to protect the boy as well as she was able in case he ever got into more trouble  all this having been happily arranged the tin woodman returned to his tin castle and his chosen comrade the scarecrow accompanied him on the way the two friends were sure to pass many pleasant hours together in talking over their recent adventures for as they neither ate nor slept they found their greatest amusement in conversation ,The Tin Woodman of Oz,L.Frank Baum

    introduction   folklore legends myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic marvelous and manifestly unreal the winged fairies of grimm and andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations  yet the old time fairy tale having served for generations may now be classed as historical in the children’s library for the time has come for a series of newer wonder tales in which the stereotyped genie dwarf and fairy are eliminated together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale modern education includes morality therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident  having this thought in mind the story of the wonderful wizard of oz was written solely to please children of today it aspires to being a modernized fairy tale in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out  l frank baum chicago april 1900    the wonderful wizard of oz     chapter i the cyclone   dorothy lived in the midst of the great kansas prairies with uncle henry who was a farmer and aunt em who was the farmer’s wife their house was small for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles there were four walls a floor and a roof which made one room and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove a cupboard for the dishes a table three or four chairs and the beds uncle henry and aunt em had a big bed in one corner and dorothy a little bed in another corner there was no garret at all and no cellar—except a small hole dug in the ground called a cyclone cellar where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose mighty enough to crush any building in its path it was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole  when dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions the sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass with little cracks running through it even the grass was not green for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere once the house had been painted but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else  when aunt em came there to live she was a young pretty wife the sun and wind had changed her too they had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips and they were gray also she was thin and gaunt and never smiled now when dorothy who was an orphan first came to her aunt em had been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever dorothy’s merry voice reached her ears and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at  uncle henry never laughed he worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was he was gray also from his long beard to his rough boots and he looked stern and solemn and rarely spoke  it was toto that made dorothy laugh and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings toto was not gray he was a little black dog with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny wee nose toto played all day long and dorothy played with him and loved him dearly  today however they were not playing uncle henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky which was even grayer than usual dorothy stood in the door with toto in her arms and looked at the sky too aunt em was washing the dishes  from the far north they heard a low wail of the wind and uncle henry and dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm there now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also  suddenly uncle henry stood up  there’s a cyclone coming em he called to his wife i’ll go look after the stock then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept  aunt em dropped her work and came to the door one glance told her of the danger close at hand  quick dorothy she screamed run for the cellar  toto jumped out of dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed and the girl started to get him aunt em badly frightened threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small dark hole dorothy caught toto at last and started to follow her aunt when she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor  then a strange thing happened  the house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon  the north and south winds met where the house stood and made it the exact center of the cyclone in the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher until it was at the very top of the cyclone and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather  it was very dark and the wind howled horribly around her but dorothy found she was riding quite easily after the first few whirls around and one other time when the house tipped badly she felt as if she were being rocked gently like a baby in a cradle  toto did not like it he ran about the room now here now there barking loudly but dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen  once toto got too near the open trap door and fell in and at first the little girl thought she had lost him but soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall she crept to the hole caught toto by the ear and dragged him into the room again afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen  hour after hour passed away and slowly dorothy got over her fright but she felt quite lonely and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf at first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring at last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed and lay down upon it and toto followed and lay down beside her  in spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep     chapter ii the council with the munchkins   she was awakened by a shock so sudden and severe that if dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt as it was the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened and toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving nor was it dark for the bright sunshine came in at the window flooding the little room she sprang from her bed and with toto at her heels ran and opened the door  the little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw  the cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty there were lovely patches of greensward all about with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes a little way off was a small brook rushing and sparkling along between green banks and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry gray prairies  while she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen they were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to but neither were they very small in fact they seemed about as tall as dorothy who was a well-grown child for her age although they were so far as looks go many years older  three were men and one a woman and all were oddly dressed they wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved the hats of the men were blue the little woman’s hat was white and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds the men were dressed in blue of the same shade as their hats and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops the men dorothy thought were about as old as uncle henry for two of them had beards but the little woman was doubtless much older her face was covered with wrinkles her hair was nearly white and she walked rather stiffly  when these people drew near the house where dorothy was standing in the doorway they paused and whispered among themselves as if afraid to come farther but the little old woman walked up to dorothy made a low bow and said in a sweet voice   you are welcome most noble sorceress to the land of the munchkins we are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked witch of the east and for setting our people free from bondage  dorothy listened to this speech with wonder what could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress and saying she had killed the wicked witch of the east dorothy was an innocent harmless little girl who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home and she had never killed anything in all her life  but the little woman evidently expected her to answer so dorothy said with hesitation you are very kind but there must be some mistake i have not killed anything  your house did anyway replied the little old woman with a laugh and that is the same thing see she continued pointing to the corner of the house there are her two feet still sticking out from under a block of wood  dorothy looked and gave a little cry of fright there indeed just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on two feet were sticking out shod in silver shoes with pointed toes  oh dear oh dear cried dorothy clasping her hands together in dismay the house must have fallen on her whatever shall we do  there is nothing to be done said the little woman calmly  but who was she asked dorothy  she was the wicked witch of the east as i said answered the little woman she has held all the munchkins in bondage for many years making them slave for her night and day now they are all set free and are grateful to you for the favor  who are the munchkins inquired dorothy  they are the people who live in this land of the east where the wicked witch ruled  are you a munchkin asked dorothy  no but i am their friend although i live in the land of the north when they saw the witch of the east was dead the munchkins sent a swift messenger to me and i came at once i am the witch of the north  oh gracious cried dorothy are you a real witch  yes indeed answered the little woman but i am a good witch and the people love me i am not as powerful as the wicked witch was who ruled here or i should have set the people free myself  but i thought all witches were wicked said the girl who was half frightened at facing a real witch  oh no that is a great mistake there were only four witches in all the land of oz and two of them those who live in the north and the south are good witches i know this is true for i am one of them myself and cannot be mistaken those who dwelt in the east and the west were indeed wicked witches but now that you have killed one of them there is but one wicked witch in all the land of oz—the one who lives in the west  but said dorothy after a moment’s thought aunt em has told me that the witches were all dead—years and years ago  who is aunt em inquired the little old woman  she is my aunt who lives in kansas where i came from  the witch of the north seemed to think for a time with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground then she looked up and said i do not know where kansas is for i have never heard that country mentioned before but tell me is it a civilized country  oh yes replied dorothy  then that accounts for it in the civilized countries i believe there are no witches left nor wizards nor sorceresses nor magicians but you see the land of oz has never been civilized for we are cut off from all the rest of the world therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us  who are the wizards asked dorothy  oz himself is the great wizard answered the witch sinking her voice to a whisper he is more powerful than all the rest of us together he lives in the city of emeralds  dorothy was going to ask another question but just then the munchkins who had been standing silently by gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the wicked witch had been lying  what is it asked the little old woman and looked and began to laugh the feet of the dead witch had disappeared entirely and nothing was left but the silver shoes  she was so old explained the witch of the north that she dried up quickly in the sun that is the end of her but the silver shoes are yours and you shall have them to wear she reached down and picked up the shoes and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to dorothy  the witch of the east was proud of those silver shoes said one of the munchkins and there is some charm connected with them but what it is we never knew  dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table then she came out again to the munchkins and said   i am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle for i am sure they will worry about me can you help me find my way  the munchkins and the witch first looked at one another and then at dorothy and then shook their heads  at the east not far from here said one there is a great desert and none could live to cross it  it is the same at the south said another for i have been there and seen it the south is the country of the quadlings  i am told said the third man that it is the same at the west and that country where the winkies live is ruled by the wicked witch of the west who would make you her slave if you passed her way  the north is my home said the old lady and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this land of oz i’m afraid my dear you will have to live with us  dorothy began to sob at this for she felt lonely among all these strange people her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted munchkins for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also as for the little old woman she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose while she counted one two three in a solemn voice at once the cap changed to a slate on which was written in big white chalk marks   let dorothy go to the city of emeralds   the little old woman took the slate from her nose and having read the words on it asked is your name dorothy my dear  yes answered the child looking up and drying her tears  then you must go to the city of emeralds perhaps oz will help you  where is this city asked dorothy  it is exactly in the center of the country and is ruled by oz the great wizard i told you of  is he a good man inquired the girl anxiously  he is a good wizard whether he is a man or not i cannot tell for i have never seen him  how can i get there asked dorothy  you must walk it is a long journey through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible however i will use all the magic arts i know of to keep you from harm  won’t you go with me pleaded the girl who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend  no i cannot do that she replied but i will give you my kiss and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the witch of the north  she came close to dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead where her lips touched the girl they left a round shining mark as dorothy found out soon after  the road to the city of emeralds is paved with yellow brick said the witch so you cannot miss it when you get to oz do not be afraid of him but tell your story and ask him to help you good-bye my dear  the three munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey after which they walked away through the trees the witch gave dorothy a friendly little nod whirled around on her left heel three times and straightway disappeared much to the surprise of little toto who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by  but dorothy knowing her to be a witch had expected her to disappear in just that way and was not surprised in the least     chapter iii how dorothy saved the scarecrow   when dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry so she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread which she spread with butter she gave some to toto and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear sparkling water toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there dorothy went to get him and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast  then she went back to the house and having helped herself and toto to a good drink of the cool clear water she set about making ready for the journey to the city of emeralds  dorothy had only one other dress but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed it was gingham with checks of white and blue and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings it was still a pretty frock the girl washed herself carefully dressed herself in the clean gingham and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head she took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard laying a white cloth over the top then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were  they surely will never do for a long journey toto she said and toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant  at that moment dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the witch of the east  i wonder if they will fit me she said to toto they would be just the thing to take a long walk in for they could not wear out  she took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her  finally she picked up her basket  come along toto she said we will go to the emerald city and ask the great oz how to get back to kansas again  she closed the door locked it and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress and so with toto trotting along soberly behind her she started on her journey  there were several roads nearby but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks within a short time she was walking briskly toward the emerald city her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard yellow road-bed the sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly and dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land  she was surprised as she walked along to see how pretty the country was about her there were neat fences at the sides of the road painted a dainty blue color and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance evidently the munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops once in a while she would pass a house and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the wicked witch and setting them free from bondage the houses of the munchkins were odd-looking dwellings for each was round with a big dome for a roof all were painted blue for in this country of the east blue was the favorite color  toward evening when dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night she came to a house rather larger than the rest on the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts pies and cakes and many other good things to eat  the people greeted dorothy kindly and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them for this was the home of one of the richest munchkins in the land and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch  dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich munchkin himself whose name was boq then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance  when boq saw her silver shoes he said you must be a great sorceress  why asked the girl  because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch besides you have white in your frock and only witches and sorceresses wear white  my dress is blue and white checked said dorothy smoothing out the wrinkles in it  it is kind of you to wear that said boq blue is the color of the munchkins and white is the witch color so we know you are a friendly witch  dorothy did not know what to say to this for all the people seemed to think her a witch and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land  when she had tired watching the dancing boq led her into the house where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it the sheets were made of blue cloth and dorothy slept soundly in them till morning with toto curled up on the blue rug beside her  she ate a hearty breakfast and watched a wee munchkin baby who played with toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused dorothy toto was a fine curiosity to all the people for they had never seen a dog before  how far is it to the emerald city the girl asked  i do not know answered boq gravely for i have never been there it is better for people to keep away from oz unless they have business with him but it is a long way to the emerald city and it will take you many days the country here is rich and pleasant but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey  this worried dorothy a little but she knew that only the great oz could help her get to kansas again so she bravely resolved not to turn back  she bade her friends good-bye and again started along the road of yellow brick when she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down there was a great cornfield beyond the fence and not far away she saw a scarecrow placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn  dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the scarecrow its head was a small sack stuffed with straw with eyes nose and mouth painted on it to represent a face an old pointed blue hat that had belonged to some munchkin was perched on his head and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes worn and faded which had also been stuffed with straw on the feet were some old boots with blue tops such as every man wore in this country and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back  while dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer painted face of the scarecrow she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her she thought she must have been mistaken at first for none of the scarecrows in kansas ever wink but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it while toto ran around the pole and barked  good day said the scarecrow in a rather husky voice  did you speak asked the girl in wonder  certainly answered the scarecrow how do you do  i’m pretty well thank you replied dorothy politely how do you do  i’m not feeling well said the scarecrow with a smile for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows  can’t you get down asked dorothy  no for this pole is stuck up my back if you will please take away the pole i shall be greatly obliged to you  dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole for being stuffed with straw it was quite light  thank you very much said the scarecrow when he had been set down on the ground i feel like a new man  dorothy was puzzled at this for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak and to see him bow and walk along beside her  who are you asked the scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned and where are you going  my name is dorothy said the girl and i am going to the emerald city to ask the great oz to send me back to kansas  where is the emerald city he inquired and who is oz  why don’t you know she returned in surprise  no indeed i don’t know anything you see i am stuffed so i have no brains at all he answered sadly  oh said dorothy i’m awfully sorry for you  do you think he asked if i go to the emerald city with you that oz would give me some brains  i cannot tell she returned but you may come with me if you like if oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now  that is true said the scarecrow you see he continued confidentially i don’t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed because i cannot get hurt if anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me it doesn’t matter for i can’t feel it but i do not want people to call me a fool and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains as yours is how am i ever to know anything  i understand how you feel said the little girl who was truly sorry for him if you will come with me i’ll ask oz to do all he can for you  thank you he answered gratefully  they walked back to the road dorothy helped him over the fence and they started along the path of yellow brick for the emerald city  toto did not like this addition to the party at first he smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the scarecrow  don’t mind toto said dorothy to her new friend he never bites  oh i’m not afraid replied the scarecrow he can’t hurt the straw do let me carry that basket for you i shall not mind it for i can’t get tired i’ll tell you a secret he continued as he walked along there is only one thing in the world i am afraid of  what is that asked dorothy the munchkin farmer who made you  no answered the scarecrow it’s a lighted match     chapter iv the road through the forest   after a few hours the road began to be rough and the walking grew so difficult that the scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks which were here very uneven sometimes indeed they were broken or missing altogether leaving holes that toto jumped across and dorothy walked around as for the scarecrow having no brains he walked straight ahead and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks it never hurt him however and dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap  the farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back there were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became  at noon they sat down by the roadside near a little brook and dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread she offered a piece to the scarecrow but he refused  i am never hungry he said and it is a lucky thing i am not for my mouth is only painted and if i should cut a hole in it so i could eat the straw i am stuffed with would come out and that would spoil the shape of my head  dorothy saw at once that this was true so she only nodded and went on eating her bread  tell me something about yourself and the country you came from said the scarecrow when she had finished her dinner so she told him all about kansas and how gray everything was there and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer land of oz  the scarecrow listened carefully and said i cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry gray place you call kansas  that is because you have no brains answered the girl no matter how dreary and gray our homes are we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country be it ever so beautiful there is no place like home  the scarecrow sighed  of course i cannot understand it he said if your heads were stuffed with straw like mine you would probably all live in the beautiful places and then kansas would have no people at all it is fortunate for kansas that you have brains  won’t you tell me a story while we are resting asked the child  the scarecrow looked at her reproachfully and answered   my life has been so short that i really know nothing whatever i was only made day before yesterday what happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me luckily when the farmer made my head one of the first things he did was to paint my ears so that i heard what was going on there was another munchkin with him and the first thing i heard was the farmer saying ‘how do you like those ears’  ‘they aren’t straight’ answered the other  ‘never mind’ said the farmer ‘they are ears just the same’ which was true enough  ‘now i’ll make the eyes’ said the farmer so he painted my right eye and as soon as it was finished i found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity for this was my first glimpse of the world  ‘that’s a rather pretty eye’ remarked the munchkin who was watching the farmer ‘blue paint is just the color for eyes’  ‘i think i’ll make the other a little bigger’ said the farmer and when the second eye was done i could see much better than before then he made my nose and my mouth but i did not speak because at that time i didn’t know what a mouth was for i had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs and when they fastened on my head at last i felt very proud for i thought i was just as good a man as anyone  ‘this fellow will scare the crows fast enough’ said the farmer ‘he looks just like a man’  ‘why he is a man’ said the other and i quite agreed with him the farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield and set me up on a tall stick where you found me he and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone  i did not like to be deserted this way so i tried to walk after them but my feet would not touch the ground and i was forced to stay on that pole it was a lonely life to lead for i had nothing to think of having been made such a little while before many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield but as soon as they saw me they flew away again thinking i was a munchkin and this pleased me and made me feel that i was quite an important person by and by an old crow flew near me and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said   ‘i wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw’ then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted the other birds seeing he was not harmed by me came to eat the corn too so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me  i felt sad at this for it showed i was not such a good scarecrow after all but the old crow comforted me saying ‘if you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them and a better man than some of them brains are the only things worth having in this world no matter whether one is a crow or a man’  after the crows had gone i thought this over and decided i would try hard to get some brains by good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake and from what you say i am sure the great oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the emerald city  i hope so said dorothy earnestly since you seem anxious to have them  oh yes i am anxious returned the scarecrow it is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool  well said the girl let us go and she handed the basket to the scarecrow  there were no fences at all by the roadside now and the land was rough and untilled toward evening they came to a great forest where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick it was almost dark under the trees for the branches shut out the daylight but the travelers did not stop and went on into the forest  if this road goes in it must come out said the scarecrow and as the emerald city is at the other end of the road we must go wherever it leads us  anyone would know that said dorothy  certainly that is why i know it returned the scarecrow if it required brains to figure it out i never should have said it  after an hour or so the light faded away and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness dorothy could not see at all but toto could for some dogs see very well in the dark and the scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day so she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well  if you see any house or any place where we can pass the night she said you must tell me for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark  soon after the scarecrow stopped  i see a little cottage at the right of us he said built of logs and branches shall we go there  yes indeed answered the child i am all tired out  so the scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage and dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner she lay down at once and with toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep the scarecrow who was never tired stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came     chapter v the rescue of the tin woodman   when dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels she sat up and looked around her there was the scarecrow still standing patiently in his corner waiting for her  we must go and search for water she said to him  why do you want water he asked  to wash my face clean after the dust of the road and to drink so the dry bread will not stick in my throat  it must be inconvenient to be made of flesh said the scarecrow thoughtfully for you must sleep and eat and drink however you have brains and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly  they left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water where dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast she saw there was not much bread left in the basket and the girl was thankful the scarecrow did not have to eat anything for there was scarcely enough for herself and toto for the day  when she had finished her meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick she was startled to hear a deep groan near by  what was that she asked timidly  i cannot imagine replied the scarecrow but we can go and see  just then another groan reached their ears and the sound seemed to come from behind them they turned and walked through the forest a few steps when dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees she ran to the place and then stopped short with a little cry of surprise  one of the big trees had been partly chopped through and standing beside it with an uplifted axe in his hands was a man made entirely of tin his head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body but he stood perfectly motionless as if he could not stir at all  dorothy looked at him in amazement and so did the scarecrow while toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs which hurt his teeth  did you groan asked dorothy  yes answered the tin man i did i’ve been groaning for more than a year and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me  what can i do for you she inquired softly for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke  get an oil-can and oil my joints he answered they are rusted so badly that i cannot move them at all if i am well oiled i shall soon be all right again you will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage  dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can and then she returned and asked anxiously where are your joints  oil my neck first replied the tin woodman so she oiled it and as it was quite badly rusted the scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely and then the man could turn it himself  now oil the joints in my arms he said and dorothy oiled them and the scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new  the tin woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe which he leaned against the tree  this is a great comfort he said i have been holding that axe in the air ever since i rusted and i’m glad to be able to put it down at last now if you will oil the joints of my legs i shall be all right once more  so they oiled his legs until he could move them freely and he thanked them again and again for his release for he seemed a very polite creature and very grateful  i might have stood there always if you had not come along he said so you have certainly saved my life how did you happen to be here  we are on our way to the emerald city to see the great oz she answered and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night  why do you wish to see oz he asked  i want him to send me back to kansas and the scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head she replied  the tin woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment then he said   do you suppose oz could give me a heart  why i guess so dorothy answered it would be as easy as to give the scarecrow brains  true the tin woodman returned so if you will allow me to join your party i will also go to the emerald city and ask oz to help me  come along said the scarecrow heartily and dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company so the tin woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick  the tin woodman had asked dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket for he said if i should get caught in the rain and rust again i would need the oil-can badly  it was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass but the tin woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party  dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again  why didn’t you walk around the hole asked the tin woodman  i don’t know enough replied the scarecrow cheerfully my head is stuffed with straw you know and that is why i am going to oz to ask him for some brains  oh i see said the tin woodman but after all brains are not the best things in the world  have you any inquired the scarecrow  no my head is quite empty answered the woodman but once i had brains and a heart also so having tried them both i should much rather have a heart  and why is that asked the scarecrow  i will tell you my story and then you will know  so while they were walking through the forest the tin woodman told the following story   i was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living when i grew up i too became a wood-chopper and after my father died i took care of my old mother as long as she lived then i made up my mind that instead of living alone i would marry so that i might not become lonely  there was one of the munchkin girls who was so beautiful that i soon grew to love her with all my heart she on her part promised to marry me as soon as i could earn enough money to build a better house for her so i set to work harder than ever but the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework so the old woman went to the wicked witch of the east and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage thereupon the wicked witch enchanted my axe and when i was chopping away at my best one day for i was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg  this at first seemed a great misfortune for i knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper so i went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin the leg worked very well once i was used to it but my action angered the wicked witch of the east for she had promised the old woman i should not marry the pretty munchkin girl when i began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg again i went to the tinsmith and again he made me a leg out of tin after this the enchanted axe cut off my arms one after the other but nothing daunted i had them replaced with tin ones the wicked witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head and at first i thought that was the end of me but the tinsmith happened to come along and he made me a new head out of tin  i thought i had beaten the wicked witch then and i worked harder than ever but i little knew how cruel my enemy could be she thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful munchkin maiden and made my axe slip again so that it cut right through my body splitting me into two halves once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it by means of joints so that i could move around as well as ever but alas i had now no heart so that i lost all my love for the munchkin girl and did not care whether i married her or not i suppose she is still living with the old woman waiting for me to come after her  my body shone so brightly in the sun that i felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped for it could not cut me there was only one danger—that my joints would rust but i kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever i needed it however there came a day when i forgot to do this and being caught in a rainstorm before i thought of the danger my joints had rusted and i was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me it was a terrible thing to undergo but during the year i stood there i had time to think that the greatest loss i had known was the loss of my heart while i was in love i was the happiest man on earth but no one can love who has not a heart and so i am resolved to ask oz to give me one if he does i will go back to the munchkin maiden and marry her  both dorothy and the scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the tin woodman and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart  all the same said the scarecrow i shall ask for brains instead of a heart for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one  i shall take the heart returned the tin woodman for brains do not make one happy and happiness is the best thing in the world  dorothy did not say anything for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right and she decided if she could only get back to kansas and aunt em it did not matter so much whether the woodman had no brains and the scarecrow no heart or each got what he wanted  what worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone and another meal for herself and toto would empty the basket to be sure neither the woodman nor the scarecrow ever ate anything but she was not made of tin nor straw and could not live unless she was fed     chapter vi the cowardly lion   all this time dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods the road was still paved with yellow brick but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees and the walking was not at all good  there were few birds in this part of the forest for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine but now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees these sounds made the little girl’s heart beat fast for she did not know what made them but toto knew and he walked close to dorothy’s side and did not even bark in return  how long will it be the child asked of the tin woodman before we are out of the forest  i cannot tell was the answer for i have never been to the emerald city but my father went there once when i was a boy and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country although nearer to the city where oz dwells the country is beautiful but i am not afraid so long as i have my oil-can and nothing can hurt the scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good witch’s kiss and that will protect you from harm  but toto said the girl anxiously what will protect him  we must protect him ourselves if he is in danger replied the tin woodman  just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar and the next moment a great lion bounded into the road with one blow of his paw he sent the scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road and then he struck at the tin woodman with his sharp claws but to the lion’s surprise he could make no impression on the tin although the woodman fell over in the road and lay still  little toto now that he had an enemy to face ran barking toward the lion and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog when dorothy fearing toto would be killed and heedless of danger rushed forward and slapped the lion upon his nose as hard as she could while she cried out   don’t you dare to bite toto you ought to be ashamed of yourself a big beast like you to bite a poor little dog  i didn’t bite him said the lion as he rubbed his nose with his paw where dorothy had hit it  no but you tried to she retorted you are nothing but a big coward  i know it said the lion hanging his head in shame i’ve always known it but how can i help it  i don’t know i’m sure to think of your striking a stuffed man like the poor scarecrow  is he stuffed asked the lion in surprise as he watched her pick up the scarecrow and set him upon his feet while she patted him into shape again  of course he’s stuffed replied dorothy who was still angry  that’s why he went over so easily remarked the lion it astonished me to see him whirl around so is the other one stuffed also  no said dorothy he’s made of tin and she helped the woodman up again  that’s why he nearly blunted my claws said the lion when they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back what is that little animal you are so tender of  he is my dog toto answered dorothy  is he made of tin or stuffed asked the lion  neither he’s a—a—a meat dog said the girl  oh he’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small now that i look at him no one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me continued the lion sadly  what makes you a coward asked dorothy looking at the great beast in wonder for he was as big as a small horse  it’s a mystery replied the lion i suppose i was born that way all the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave for the lion is everywhere thought to be the king of beasts i learned that if i roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way whenever i’ve met a man i’ve been awfully scared but i just roared at him and he has always run away as fast as he could go if the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me i should have run myself—i’m such a coward but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me and of course i let them go  but that isn’t right the king of beasts shouldn’t be a coward said the scarecrow  i know it returned the lion wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail it is my great sorrow and makes my life very unhappy but whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast  perhaps you have heart disease said the tin woodman  it may be said the lion  if you have continued the tin woodman you ought to be glad for it proves you have a heart for my part i have no heart so i cannot have heart disease  perhaps said the lion thoughtfully if i had no heart i should not be a coward  have you brains asked the scarecrow  i suppose so i’ve never looked to see replied the lion  i am going to the great oz to ask him to give me some remarked the scarecrow for my head is stuffed with straw  and i am going to ask him to give me a heart said the woodman  and i am going to ask him to send toto and me back to kansas added dorothy  do you think oz could give me courage asked the cowardly lion  just as easily as he could give me brains said the scarecrow  or give me a heart said the tin woodman  or send me back to kansas said dorothy  then if you don’t mind i’ll go with you said the lion for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage  you will be very welcome answered dorothy for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts it seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily  they really are said the lion but that doesn’t make me any braver and as long as i know myself to be a coward i shall be unhappy  so once more the little company set off upon the journey the lion walking with stately strides at dorothy’s side toto did not approve of this new comrade at first for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the lion’s great jaws but after a time he became more at ease and presently toto and the cowardly lion had grown to be good friends  during the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey once indeed the tin woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road and killed the poor little thing this made the tin woodman very unhappy for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret these tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw and there they rusted when dorothy presently asked him a question the tin woodman could not open his mouth for his jaws were tightly rusted together he became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to dorothy to relieve him but she could not understand the lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong but the scarecrow seized the oil-can from dorothy’s basket and oiled the woodman’s jaws so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before  this will serve me a lesson said he to look where i step for if i should kill another bug or beetle i should surely cry again and crying rusts my jaws so that i cannot speak  thereafter he walked very carefully with his eyes on the road and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it so as not to harm it the tin woodman knew very well he had no heart and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything  you people with hearts he said have something to guide you and need never do wrong but i have no heart and so i must be very careful when oz gives me a heart of course i needn’t mind so much     chapter vii the journey to the great oz   they were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest for there were no houses near the tree made a good thick covering to protect them from the dew and the tin woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely she and toto ate the last of their bread and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast  if you wish said the lion i will go into the forest and kill a deer for you you can roast it by the fire since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food and then you will have a very good breakfast  don’t please don’t begged the tin woodman i should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer and then my jaws would rust again  but the lion went away into the forest and found his own supper and no one ever knew what it was for he didn’t mention it and the scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled dorothy’s basket with them so that she would not be hungry for a long time she thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the scarecrow but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts his padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket but the scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket for it enabled him to keep away from the fire as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up so he kept a good distance away from the flames and only came near to cover dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep these kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning  when it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook and soon after they all started toward the emerald city  this was to be an eventful day for the travelers they had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side it was a very wide ditch and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep and there were many big jagged rocks at the bottom the sides were so steep that none of them could climb down and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end  what shall we do asked dorothy despairingly  i haven’t the faintest idea said the tin woodman and the lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful  but the scarecrow said we cannot fly that is certain neither can we climb down into this great ditch therefore if we cannot jump over it we must stop where we are  i think i could jump over it said the cowardly lion after measuring the distance carefully in his mind  then we are all right answered the scarecrow for you can carry us all over on your back one at a time  well i’ll try it said the lion who will go first  i will declared the scarecrow for if you found that you could not jump over the gulf dorothy would be killed or the tin woodman badly dented on the rocks below but if i am on your back it will not matter so much for the fall would not hurt me at all  i am terribly afraid of falling myself said the cowardly lion but i suppose there is nothing to do but try it so get on my back and we will make the attempt  the scarecrow sat upon the lion’s back and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down  why don’t you run and jump asked the scarecrow  because that isn’t the way we lions do these things he replied then giving a great spring he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side they were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it and after the scarecrow had got down from his back the lion sprang across the ditch again  dorothy thought she would go next so she took toto in her arms and climbed on the lion’s back holding tightly to his mane with one hand the next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air and then before she had time to think about it she was safe on the other side the lion went back a third time and got the tin woodman and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest for his great leaps had made his breath short and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long  they found the forest very thick on this side and it looked dark and gloomy after the lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick silently wondering each in his own mind if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again to add to their discomfort they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest and the lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the kalidahs lived  what are the kalidahs asked the girl  they are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers replied the lion and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as i could kill toto i’m terribly afraid of the kalidahs  i’m not surprised that you are returned dorothy they must be dreadful beasts  the lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road but this one was so broad and deep that the lion knew at once he could not leap across it  so they sat down to consider what they should do and after serious thought the scarecrow said   here is a great tree standing close to the ditch if the tin woodman can chop it down so that it will fall to the other side we can walk across it easily  that is a first-rate idea said the lion one would almost suspect you had brains in your head instead of straw  the woodman set to work at once and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through then the lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch with its top branches on the other side  they had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers  they are the kalidahs said the cowardly lion beginning to tremble  quick cried the scarecrow let us cross over  so dorothy went first holding toto in her arms the tin woodman followed and the scarecrow came next the lion although he was certainly afraid turned to face the kalidahs and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that dorothy screamed and the scarecrow fell over backward while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise  but seeing they were bigger than the lion and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him the kalidahs again rushed forward and the lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree and the lion said to dorothy   we are lost for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws but stand close behind me and i will fight them as long as i am alive  wait a minute called the scarecrow he had been thinking what was best to be done and now he asked the woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch the tin woodman began to use his axe at once and just as the two kalidahs were nearly across the tree fell with a crash into the gulf carrying the ugly snarling brutes with it and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom  well said the cowardly lion drawing a long breath of relief i see we are going to live a little while longer and i am glad of it for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet  ah said the tin woodman sadly i wish i had a heart to beat  this adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest and they walked so fast that dorothy became tired and had to ride on the lion’s back to their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river flowing swiftly just before them on the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits they were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them  how shall we cross the river asked dorothy  that is easily done replied the scarecrow the tin woodman must build us a raft so we can float to the other side  so the woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft and while he was busy at this the scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit this pleased dorothy who had eaten nothing but nuts all day and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit  but it takes time to make a raft even when one is as industrious and untiring as the tin woodman and when night came the work was not done so they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning and dorothy dreamed of the emerald city and of the good wizard oz who would soon send her back to her own home again     chapter viii the deadly poppy field   our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope and dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through although they had suffered many discouragements but before them was a lovely sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the emerald city  to be sure the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land but the raft was nearly done and after the tin woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins they were ready to start dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held toto in her arms when the cowardly lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly for he was big and heavy but the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood upon the other end to steady it and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water  they got along quite well at first but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick and the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom  this is bad said the tin woodman for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the wicked witch of the west and she will enchant us and make us her slaves  and then i should get no brains said the scarecrow  and i should get no courage said the cowardly lion  and i should get no heart said the tin woodman  and i should never get back to kansas said dorothy  we must certainly get to the emerald city if we can the scarecrow continued and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river then before he could pull it out again—or let go—the raft was swept away and the poor scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river  good-bye he called after them and they were very sorry to leave him indeed the tin woodman began to cry but fortunately remembered that he might rust and so dried his tears on dorothy’s apron  of course this was a bad thing for the scarecrow  i am now worse off than when i first met dorothy he thought then i was stuck on a pole in a cornfield where i could make-believe scare the crows at any rate but surely there is no use for a scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river i am afraid i shall never have any brains after all  down the stream the raft floated and the poor scarecrow was left far behind then the lion said   something must be done to save us i think i can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail  so he sprang into the water and the tin woodman caught fast hold of his tail then the lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore it was hard work although he was so big but by and by they were drawn out of the current and then dorothy took the tin woodman’s long pole and helped push the raft to the land  they were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the emerald city  what shall we do now asked the tin woodman as the lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him  we must get back to the road in some way said dorothy  the best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again remarked the lion  so when they were rested dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank to the road from which the river had carried them it was a lovely country with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them and had they not felt so sorry for the poor scarecrow they could have been very happy  they walked along as fast as they could dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower and after a time the tin woodman cried out  look  then they all looked at the river and saw the scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water looking very lonely and sad  what can we do to save him asked dorothy  the lion and the woodman both shook their heads for they did not know so they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the scarecrow until a stork flew by who upon seeing them stopped to rest at the water’s edge  who are you and where are you going asked the stork  i am dorothy answered the girl and these are my friends the tin woodman and the cowardly lion and we are going to the emerald city  this isn’t the road said the stork as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party  i know it returned dorothy but we have lost the scarecrow and are wondering how we shall get him again  where is he asked the stork  over there in the river answered the little girl  if he wasn’t so big and heavy i would get him for you remarked the stork  he isn’t heavy a bit said dorothy eagerly for he is stuffed with straw and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much  well i’ll try said the stork but if i find he is too heavy to carry i shall have to drop him in the river again  so the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the scarecrow was perched upon his pole then the stork with her great claws grabbed the scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank where dorothy and the lion and the tin woodman and toto were sitting  when the scarecrow found himself among his friends again he was so happy that he hugged them all even the lion and toto and as they walked along he sang tol-de-ri-de-oh at every step he felt so gay  i was afraid i should have to stay in the river forever he said but the kind stork saved me and if i ever get any brains i shall find the stork again and do her some kindness in return  that’s all right said the stork who was flying along beside them i always like to help anyone in trouble but i must go now for my babies are waiting in the nest for me i hope you will find the emerald city and that oz will help you  thank you replied dorothy and then the kind stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight  they walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them there were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms besides great clusters of scarlet poppies which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled dorothy’s eyes  aren’t they beautiful the girl asked as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers  i suppose so answered the scarecrow when i have brains i shall probably like them better  if i only had a heart i should love them added the tin woodman  i always did like flowers said the lion they seem so helpless and frail but there are none in the forest so bright as these  they now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies and fewer and fewer of the other flowers and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever but dorothy did not know this nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep  but the tin woodman would not let her do this  we must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark he said and the scarecrow agreed with him so they kept walking until dorothy could stand no longer her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies fast asleep  what shall we do asked the tin woodman  if we leave her here she will die said the lion the smell of the flowers is killing us all i myself can scarcely keep my eyes open and the dog is asleep already  it was true toto had fallen down beside his little mistress but the scarecrow and the tin woodman not being made of flesh were not troubled by the scent of the flowers  run fast said the scarecrow to the lion and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can we will bring the little girl with us but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried  so the lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go in a moment he was out of sight  let us make a chair with our hands and carry her said the scarecrow so they picked up toto and put the dog in dorothy’s lap and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers  on and on they walked and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end they followed the bend of the river and at last came upon their friend the lion lying fast asleep among the poppies the flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them  we can do nothing for him said the tin woodman sadly for he is much too heavy to lift we must leave him here to sleep on forever and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last  i’m sorry said the scarecrow the lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly but let us go on  they carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her     chapter ix the queen of the field mice   we cannot be far from the road of yellow brick now remarked the scarecrow as he stood beside the girl for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away  the tin woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl and turning his head which worked beautifully on hinges he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them it was indeed a great yellow wildcat and the woodman thought it must be chasing something for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open showing two rows of ugly teeth while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire as it came nearer the tin woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty harmless creature  so the woodman raised his axe and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces  the field mouse now that it was freed from its enemy stopped short and coming slowly up to the woodman it said in a squeaky little voice   oh thank you thank you ever so much for saving my life  don’t speak of it i beg of you replied the woodman i have no heart you know so i am careful to help all those who may need a friend even if it happens to be only a mouse  only a mouse cried the little animal indignantly why i am a queen—the queen of all the field mice  oh indeed said the woodman making a bow  therefore you have done a great deed as well as a brave one in saving my life added the queen  at that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them and when they saw their queen they exclaimed   oh your majesty we thought you would be killed how did you manage to escape the great wildcat they all bowed so low to the little queen that they almost stood upon their heads  this funny tin man she answered killed the wildcat and saved my life so hereafter you must all serve him and obey his slightest wish  we will cried all the mice in a shrill chorus and then they scampered in all directions for toto had awakened from his sleep and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in kansas and he saw no harm in it  but the tin woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight while he called to the mice come back come back toto shall not hurt you  at this the queen of the mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked in a timid voice are you sure he will not bite us  i will not let him said the woodman so do not be afraid  one by one the mice came creeping back and toto did not bark again although he tried to get out of the woodman’s arms and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin finally one of the biggest mice spoke  is there anything we can do it asked to repay you for saving the life of our queen  nothing that i know of answered the woodman but the scarecrow who had been trying to think but could not because his head was stuffed with straw said quickly oh yes you can save our friend the cowardly lion who is asleep in the poppy bed  a lion cried the little queen why he would eat us all up  oh no declared the scarecrow this lion is a coward  really asked the mouse  he says so himself answered the scarecrow and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend if you will help us to save him i promise that he shall treat you all with kindness  very well said the queen we trust you but what shall we do  are there many of these mice which call you queen and are willing to obey you  oh yes there are thousands she replied  then send for them all to come here as soon as possible and let each one bring a long piece of string  the queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people as soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible  now said the scarecrow to the tin woodman you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the lion  so the woodman went at once to the trees and began to work and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches he fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk so fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them  they came from all directions and there were thousands of them  big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth it was about this time that dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes she was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly but the scarecrow told her about everything and turning to the dignified little mouse he said   permit me to introduce to you her majesty the queen  dorothy nodded gravely and the queen made a curtsy after which she became quite friendly with the little girl  the scarecrow and the woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck using the strings they had brought one end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily even the scarecrow and the tin woodman could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the lion lay asleep  after a great deal of hard work for the lion was heavy they managed to get him up on the truck then the queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep  at first the little creatures many though they were could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck but the woodman and the scarecrow both pushed from behind and they got along better soon they rolled the lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields where he could breathe the sweet fresh air again instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers  dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death she had grown so fond of the big lion she was glad he had been rescued  then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes the queen of the mice was the last to leave  if ever you need us again she said come out into the field and call and we shall hear you and come to your assistance good-bye  good-bye they all answered and away the queen ran while dorothy held toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her  after this they sat down beside the lion until he should awaken and the scarecrow brought dorothy some fruit from a tree near by which she ate for her dinner     chapter x the guardian of the gate   it was some time before the cowardly lion awakened for he had lain among the poppies a long while breathing in their deadly fragrance but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive  i ran as fast as i could he said sitting down and yawning but the flowers were too strong for me how did you get me out  then they told him of the field mice and how they had generously saved him from death and the cowardly lion laughed and said   i have always thought myself very big and terrible yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me and such small animals as mice have saved my life how strange it all is but comrades what shall we do now  we must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again said dorothy and then we can keep on to the emerald city  so the lion being fully refreshed and feeling quite himself again they all started upon the journey greatly enjoying the walk through the soft fresh grass and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the emerald city where the great oz dwelt  the road was smooth and well paved now and the country about was beautiful so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades once more they could see fences built beside the road but these were painted green and when they came to a small house in which a farmer evidently lived that also was painted green they passed by several of these houses during the afternoon and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great lion of which they were very much afraid the people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the munchkins  this must be the land of oz said dorothy and we are surely getting near the emerald city  yes answered the scarecrow everything is green here while in the country of the munchkins blue was the favorite color but the people do not seem to be as friendly as the munchkins and i’m afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night  i should like something to eat besides fruit said the girl and i’m sure toto is nearly starved let us stop at the next house and talk to the people  so when they came to a good-sized farmhouse dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked  a woman opened it just far enough to look out and said what do you want child and why is that great lion with you  we wish to pass the night with you if you will allow us answered dorothy and the lion is my friend and comrade and would not hurt you for the world  is he tame asked the woman opening the door a little wider  oh yes said the girl and he is a great coward too he will be more afraid of you than you are of him  well said the woman after thinking it over and taking another peep at the lion if that is the case you may come in and i will give you some supper and a place to sleep  so they all entered the house where there were besides the woman two children and a man the man had hurt his leg and was lying on the couch in a corner they seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked   where are you all going  to the emerald city said dorothy to see the great oz  oh indeed exclaimed the man are you sure that oz will see you  why not she replied  why it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence i have been to the emerald city many times and it is a beautiful and wonderful place but i have never been permitted to see the great oz nor do i know of any living person who has seen him  does he never go out asked the scarecrow  never he sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face  what is he like asked the girl  that is hard to tell said the man thoughtfully you see oz is a great wizard and can take on any form he wishes so that some say he looks like a bird and some say he looks like an elephant and some say he looks like a cat to others he appears as a beautiful fairy or a brownie or in any other form that pleases him but who the real oz is when he is in his own form no living person can tell  that is very strange said dorothy but we must try in some way to see him or we shall have made our journey for nothing  why do you wish to see the terrible oz asked the man  i want him to give me some brains said the scarecrow eagerly  oh oz could do that easily enough declared the man he has more brains than he needs  and i want him to give me a heart said the tin woodman  that will not trouble him continued the man for oz has a large collection of hearts of all sizes and shapes  and i want him to give me courage said the cowardly lion  oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room said the man which he has covered with a golden plate to keep it from running over he will be glad to give you some  and i want him to send me back to kansas said dorothy  where is kansas asked the man with surprise  i don’t know replied dorothy sorrowfully but it is my home and i’m sure it’s somewhere  very likely well oz can do anything so i suppose he will find kansas for you but first you must get to see him and that will be a hard task for the great wizard does not like to see anyone and he usually has his own way but what do you want he continued speaking to toto toto only wagged his tail for strange to say he could not speak  the woman now called to them that supper was ready so they gathered around the table and dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread and enjoyed her meal the lion ate some of the porridge but did not care for it saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses not for lions the scarecrow and the tin woodman ate nothing at all toto ate a little of everything and was glad to get a good supper again  the woman now gave dorothy a bed to sleep in and toto lay down beside her while the lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night although of course they could not sleep  the next morning as soon as the sun was up they started on their way and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them  that must be the emerald city said dorothy  as they walked on the green glow became brighter and brighter and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the city it was high and thick and of a bright green color  in front of them and at the end of the road of yellow brick was a big gate all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy  there was a bell beside the gate and dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within then the big gate swung slowly open and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds  before them stood a little man about the same size as the munchkins he was clothed all in green from his head to his feet and even his skin was of a greenish tint at his side was a large green box  when he saw dorothy and her companions the man asked what do you wish in the emerald city  we came here to see the great oz said dorothy  the man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over  it has been many years since anyone asked me to see oz he said shaking his head in perplexity he is powerful and terrible and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the great wizard he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant  but it is not a foolish errand nor an idle one replied the scarecrow it is important and we have been told that oz is a good wizard  so he is said the green man and he rules the emerald city wisely and well but to those who are not honest or who approach him from curiosity he is most terrible and few have ever dared ask to see his face i am the guardian of the gates and since you demand to see the great oz i must take you to his palace but first you must put on the spectacles  why asked dorothy  because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the emerald city would blind you even those who live in the city must wear spectacles night and day they are all locked on for oz so ordered it when the city was first built and i have the only key that will unlock them  he opened the big box and dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape all of them had green glasses in them the guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit dorothy and put them over her eyes there were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the guardian of the gates wore around his neck when they were on dorothy could not take them off had she wished but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the emerald city so she said nothing  then the green man fitted spectacles for the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion and even on little toto and all were locked fast with the key  then the guardian of the gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the emerald city     chapter xi the wonderful city of oz   even with eyes protected by the green spectacles dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful city the streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds they walked over a pavement of the same green marble and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds set closely and glittering in the brightness of the sun the window panes were of green glass even the sky above the city had a green tint and the rays of the sun were green  there were many people—men women and children—walking about and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins they looked at dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the lion but no one spoke to them many shops stood in the street and dorothy saw that everything in them was green green candy and green pop-corn were offered for sale as well as green shoes green hats and green clothes of all sorts at one place a man was selling green lemonade and when the children bought it dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies  there seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind the men carried things around in little green carts which they pushed before them everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous  the guardian of the gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building exactly in the middle of the city which was the palace of oz the great wizard there was a soldier before the door dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard  here are strangers said the guardian of the gates to him and they demand to see the great oz  step inside answered the soldier and i will carry your message to him  so they passed through the palace gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds the soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room and when they were seated he said politely   please make yourselves comfortable while i go to the door of the throne room and tell oz you are here  they had to wait a long time before the soldier returned when at last he came back dorothy asked   have you seen oz  oh no returned the soldier i have never seen him but i spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message he said he will grant you an audience if you so desire but each one of you must enter his presence alone and he will admit but one each day therefore as you must remain in the palace for several days i will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey  thank you replied the girl that is very kind of oz  the soldier now blew upon a green whistle and at once a young girl dressed in a pretty green silk gown entered the room she had lovely green hair and green eyes and she bowed low before dorothy as she said follow me and i will show you your room  so dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except toto and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the palace it was the sweetest little room in the world with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane there was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room that shot a spray of green perfume into the air to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin beautiful green flowers stood in the windows and there was a shelf with a row of little green books when dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh they were so funny  in a wardrobe were many green dresses made of silk and satin and velvet and all of them fitted dorothy exactly  make yourself perfectly at home said the green girl and if you wish for anything ring the bell oz will send for you tomorrow morning  she left dorothy alone and went back to the others these she also led to rooms and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the palace of course this politeness was wasted on the scarecrow for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot just within the doorway to wait till morning it would not rest him to lie down and he could not close his eyes so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world the tin woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit for he remembered when he was made of flesh but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order the lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest and did not like being shut up in a room but he had too much sense to let this worry him so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute  the next morning after breakfast the green maiden came to fetch dorothy and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns made of green brocaded satin dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around toto’s neck and they started for the throne room of the great oz  first they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court all dressed in rich costumes these people had nothing to do but talk to each other but they always came to wait outside the throne room every morning although they were never permitted to see oz as dorothy entered they looked at her curiously and one of them whispered   are you really going to look upon the face of oz the terrible  of course answered the girl if he will see me  oh he will see you said the soldier who had taken her message to the wizard although he does not like to have people ask to see him indeed at first he was angry and said i should send you back where you came from then he asked me what you looked like and when i mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested at last i told him about the mark upon your forehead and he decided he would admit you to his presence  just then a bell rang and the green girl said to dorothy that is the signal you must go into the throne room alone  she opened a little door and dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place it was a big round room with a high arched roof and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together in the center of the roof was a great light as bright as the sun which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner  but what interested dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room it was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems as did everything else in the center of the chair was an enormous head without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever there was no hair upon this head but it had eyes and a nose and mouth and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant  as dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily then the mouth moved and dorothy heard a voice say   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  it was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big head so she took courage and answered   i am dorothy the small and meek i have come to you for help  the eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute then said the voice   where did you get the silver shoes  i got them from the wicked witch of the east when my house fell on her and killed her she replied  where did you get the mark upon your forehead continued the voice  that is where the good witch of the north kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you said the girl  again the eyes looked at her sharply and they saw she was telling the truth then oz asked what do you wish me to do  send me back to kansas where my aunt em and uncle henry are she answered earnestly i don’t like your country although it is so beautiful and i am sure aunt em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long  the eyes winked three times and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room and at last they looked at dorothy again  why should i do this for you asked oz  because you are strong and i am weak because you are a great wizard and i am only a little girl  but you were strong enough to kill the wicked witch of the east said oz  that just happened returned dorothy simply i could not help it  well said the head i will give you my answer you have no right to expect me to send you back to kansas unless you do something for me in return in this country everyone must pay for everything he gets if you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first help me and i will help you  what must i do asked the girl  kill the wicked witch of the west answered oz  but i cannot exclaimed dorothy greatly surprised  you killed the witch of the east and you wear the silver shoes which bear a powerful charm there is now but one wicked witch left in all this land and when you can tell me she is dead i will send you back to kansas—but not before  the little girl began to weep she was so much disappointed and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously as if the great oz felt that she could help him if she would  i never killed anything willingly she sobbed even if i wanted to how could i kill the wicked witch if you who are great and terrible cannot kill her yourself how do you expect me to do it  i do not know said the head but that is my answer and until the wicked witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again remember that the witch is wicked—tremendously wicked—and ought to be killed now go and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task  sorrowfully dorothy left the throne room and went back where the lion and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were waiting to hear what oz had said to her there is no hope for me she said sadly for oz will not send me home until i have killed the wicked witch of the west and that i can never do  her friends were sorry but could do nothing to help her so dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep  the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the scarecrow and said   come with me for oz has sent for you  so the scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great throne room where he saw sitting in the emerald throne a most lovely lady she was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels growing from her shoulders were wings gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them  when the scarecrow had bowed as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him before this beautiful creature she looked upon him sweetly and said   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  now the scarecrow who had expected to see the great head dorothy had told him of was much astonished but he answered her bravely  i am only a scarecrow stuffed with straw therefore i have no brains and i come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw so that i may become as much a man as any other in your dominions  why should i do this for you asked the lady  because you are wise and powerful and no one else can help me answered the scarecrow  i never grant favors without some return said oz but this much i will promise if you will kill for me the wicked witch of the west i will bestow upon you a great many brains and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the land of oz  i thought you asked dorothy to kill the witch said the scarecrow in surprise  so i did i don’t care who kills her but until she is dead i will not grant your wish now go and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire  the scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what oz had said and dorothy was surprised to find that the great wizard was not a head as she had seen him but a lovely lady  all the same said the scarecrow she needs a heart as much as the tin woodman  on the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the tin woodman and said   oz has sent for you follow me  so the tin woodman followed him and came to the great throne room he did not know whether he would find oz a lovely lady or a head but he hoped it would be the lovely lady for he said to himself if it is the head i am sure i shall not be given a heart since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me but if it is the lovely lady i shall beg hard for a heart for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted  but when the woodman entered the great throne room he saw neither the head nor the lady for oz had taken the shape of a most terrible beast it was nearly as big as an elephant and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight the beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros only there were five eyes in its face there were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long slim legs thick woolly hair covered every part of it and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined it was fortunate the tin woodman had no heart at that moment for it would have beat loud and fast from terror but being only tin the woodman was not at all afraid although he was much disappointed  i am oz the great and terrible spoke the beast in a voice that was one great roar who are you and why do you seek me  i am a woodman and made of tin therefore i have no heart and cannot love i pray you to give me a heart that i may be as other men are  why should i do this demanded the beast  because i ask it and you alone can grant my request answered the woodman  oz gave a low growl at this but said gruffly  if you indeed desire a heart you must earn it  how asked the woodman  help dorothy to kill the wicked witch of the west replied the beast when the witch is dead come to me and i will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the land of oz  so the tin woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible beast he had seen they all wondered greatly at the many forms the great wizard could take upon himself and the lion said   if he is a beast when i go to see him i shall roar my loudest and so frighten him that he will grant all i ask and if he is the lovely lady i shall pretend to spring upon her and so compel her to do my bidding and if he is the great head he will be at my mercy for i will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire so be of good cheer my friends for all will yet be well  the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the lion to the great throne room and bade him enter the presence of oz  the lion at once passed through the door and glancing around saw to his surprise that before the throne was a ball of fire so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it his first thought was that oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up but when he tried to go nearer the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door  then a low quiet voice came from the ball of fire and these were the words it spoke   i am oz the great and terrible who are you and why do you seek me  and the lion answered i am a cowardly lion afraid of everything i came to you to beg that you give me courage so that in reality i may become the king of beasts as men call me  why should i give you courage demanded oz  because of all wizards you are the greatest and alone have power to grant my request answered the lion  the ball of fire burned fiercely for a time and the voice said bring me proof that the wicked witch is dead and that moment i will give you courage but as long as the witch lives you must remain a coward  the lion was angry at this speech but could say nothing in reply and while he stood silently gazing at the ball of fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room he was glad to find his friends waiting for him and told them of his terrible interview with the wizard  what shall we do now asked dorothy sadly  there is only one thing we can do returned the lion and that is to go to the land of the winkies seek out the wicked witch and destroy her  but suppose we cannot said the girl  then i shall never have courage declared the lion  and i shall never have brains added the scarecrow  and i shall never have a heart spoke the tin woodman  and i shall never see aunt em and uncle henry said dorothy beginning to cry  be careful cried the green girl the tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it  so dorothy dried her eyes and said i suppose we must try it but i am sure i do not want to kill anybody even to see aunt em again  i will go with you but i’m too much of a coward to kill the witch said the lion  i will go too declared the scarecrow but i shall not be of much help to you i am such a fool  i haven’t the heart to harm even a witch remarked the tin woodman but if you go i certainly shall go with you  therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning and the woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled the scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better the green girl who was very kind to them filled dorothy’s basket with good things to eat and fastened a little bell around toto’s neck with a green ribbon  they went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the palace and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg     chapter xii the search for the wicked witch   the soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the emerald city until they reached the room where the guardian of the gates lived this officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box and then he politely opened the gate for our friends  which road leads to the wicked witch of the west asked dorothy  there is no road answered the guardian of the gates no one ever wishes to go that way  how then are we to find her inquired the girl  that will be easy replied the man for when she knows you are in the country of the winkies she will find you and make you all her slaves  perhaps not said the scarecrow for we mean to destroy her  oh that is different said the guardian of the gates no one has ever destroyed her before so i naturally thought she would make slaves of you as she has of the rest but take care for she is wicked and fierce and may not allow you to destroy her keep to the west where the sun sets and you cannot fail to find her  they thanked him and bade him good-bye and turned toward the west walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace but now to her surprise she found it was no longer green but pure white the ribbon around toto’s neck had also lost its green color and was as white as dorothy’s dress  the emerald city was soon left far behind as they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the west and the ground was untilled  in the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces for there were no trees to offer them shade so that before night dorothy and toto and the lion were tired and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch  now the wicked witch of the west had but one eye yet that was as powerful as a telescope and could see everywhere so as she sat in the door of her castle she happened to look around and saw dorothy lying asleep with her friends all about her they were a long distance off but the wicked witch was angry to find them in her country so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck  at once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves they had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth  go to those people said the witch and tear them to pieces  are you not going to make them your slaves asked the leader of the wolves  no she answered one is of tin and one of straw one is a girl and another a lion none of them is fit to work so you may tear them into small pieces  very well said the wolf and he dashed away at full speed followed by the others  it was lucky the scarecrow and the woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming  this is my fight said the woodman so get behind me and i will meet them as they come  he seized his axe which he had made very sharp and as the leader of the wolves came on the tin woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s head from its body so that it immediately died as soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up and he also fell under the sharp edge of the tin woodman’s weapon there were forty wolves and forty times a wolf was killed so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the woodman  then he put down his axe and sat beside the scarecrow who said it was a good fight friend  they waited until dorothy awoke the next morning the little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves but the tin woodman told her all she thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast after which they started again upon their journey  now this same morning the wicked witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off she saw all her wolves lying dead and the strangers still traveling through her country this made her angrier than before and she blew her silver whistle twice  straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her enough to darken the sky  and the wicked witch said to the king crow fly at once to the strangers peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces  the wild crows flew in one great flock toward dorothy and her companions when the little girl saw them coming she was afraid  but the scarecrow said this is my battle so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed  so they all lay upon the ground except the scarecrow and he stood up and stretched out his arms and when the crows saw him they were frightened as these birds always are by scarecrows and did not dare to come any nearer but the king crow said   it is only a stuffed man i will peck his eyes out  the king crow flew at the scarecrow who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died and then another crow flew at him and the scarecrow twisted its neck also there were forty crows and forty times the scarecrow twisted a neck until at last all were lying dead beside him then he called to his companions to rise and again they went upon their journey  when the wicked witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap she got into a terrible rage and blew three times upon her silver whistle  forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her  go to the strangers and sting them to death commanded the witch and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where dorothy and her friends were walking but the woodman had seen them coming and the scarecrow had decided what to do  take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the lion he said to the woodman and the bees cannot sting them this the woodman did and as dorothy lay close beside the lion and held toto in her arms the straw covered them entirely  the bees came and found no one but the woodman to sting so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin without hurting the woodman at all and as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees and they lay scattered thick about the woodman like little heaps of fine coal  then dorothy and the lion got up and the girl helped the tin woodman put the straw back into the scarecrow again until he was as good as ever so they started upon their journey once more  the wicked witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth and then she called a dozen of her slaves who were the winkies and gave them sharp spears telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them  the winkies were not a brave people but they had to do as they were told so they marched away until they came near to dorothy then the lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them and the poor winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could  when they returned to the castle the wicked witch beat them well with a strap and sent them back to their work after which she sat down to think what she should do next she could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed but she was a powerful witch as well as a wicked one and she soon made up her mind how to act  there was in her cupboard a golden cap with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it this golden cap had a charm whoever owned it could call three times upon the winged monkeys who would obey any order they were given but no person could command these strange creatures more than three times twice already the wicked witch had used the charm of the cap once was when she had made the winkies her slaves and set herself to rule over their country the winged monkeys had helped her do this the second time was when she had fought against the great oz himself and driven him out of the land of the west the winged monkeys had also helped her in doing this only once more could she use this golden cap for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted but now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone and her slaves had been scared away by the cowardly lion she saw there was only one way left to destroy dorothy and her friends  so the wicked witch took the golden cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly   ep-pe pep-pe kak-ke  next she stood upon her right foot and said   hil-lo hol-lo hel-lo  after this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice   ziz-zy zuz-zy zik  now the charm began to work the sky was darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air there was a rushing of many wings a great chattering and laughing and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the wicked witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders  one much bigger than the others seemed to be their leader he flew close to the witch and said you have called us for the third and last time what do you command  go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the lion said the wicked witch bring that beast to me for i have a mind to harness him like a horse and make him work  your commands shall be obeyed said the leader then with a great deal of chattering and noise the winged monkeys flew away to the place where dorothy and her friends were walking  some of the monkeys seized the tin woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks here they dropped the poor woodman who fell a great distance to the rocks where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan  others of the monkeys caught the scarecrow and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head they made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree  the remaining monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the witch’s castle where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it so that he could not escape  but dorothy they did not harm at all she stood with toto in her arms watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn the leader of the winged monkeys flew up to her his long hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly but he saw the mark of the good witch’s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short motioning the others not to touch her  we dare not harm this little girl he said to them for she is protected by the power of good and that is greater than the power of evil all we can do is to carry her to the castle of the wicked witch and leave her there  so carefully and gently they lifted dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle where they set her down upon the front doorstep then the leader said to the witch   we have obeyed you as far as we were able the tin woodman and the scarecrow are destroyed and the lion is tied up in your yard the little girl we dare not harm nor the dog she carries in her arms your power over our band is now ended and you will never see us again  then all the winged monkeys with much laughing and chattering and noise flew into the air and were soon out of sight  the wicked witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on dorothy’s forehead for she knew well that neither the winged monkeys nor she herself dare hurt the girl in any way she looked down at dorothy’s feet and seeing the silver shoes began to tremble with fear for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them at first the witch was tempted to run away from dorothy but she happened to look into the child’s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the silver shoes gave her so the wicked witch laughed to herself and thought i can still make her my slave for she does not know how to use her power then she said to dorothy harshly and severely   come with me and see that you mind everything i tell you for if you do not i will make an end of you as i did of the tin woodman and the scarecrow  dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen where the witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood  dorothy went to work meekly with her mind made up to work as hard as she could for she was glad the wicked witch had decided not to kill her  with dorothy hard at work the witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the cowardly lion like a horse it would amuse her she was sure to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive but as she opened the gate the lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the witch was afraid and ran out and shut the gate again  if i cannot harness you said the witch to the lion speaking through the bars of the gate i can starve you you shall have nothing to eat until you do as i wish  so after that she took no food to the imprisoned lion but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked are you ready to be harnessed like a horse  and the lion would answer no if you come in this yard i will bite you  the reason the lion did not have to do as the witch wished was that every night while the woman was asleep dorothy carried him food from the cupboard after he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw and dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft shaggy mane while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape but they could find no way to get out of the castle for it was constantly guarded by the yellow winkies who were the slaves of the wicked witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them  the girl had to work hard during the day and often the witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand but in truth she did not dare to strike dorothy because of the mark upon her forehead the child did not know this and was full of fear for herself and toto once the witch struck toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return the witch did not bleed where she was bitten for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before  dorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to kansas and aunt em again sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours with toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress toto did not really care whether he was in kansas or the land of oz so long as dorothy was with him but he knew the little girl was unhappy and that made him unhappy too  now the wicked witch had a great longing to have for her own the silver shoes which the girl always wore her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up and she had used up all the power of the golden cap but if she could only get hold of the silver shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost she watched dorothy carefully to see if she ever took off her shoes thinking she might steal them but the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath the witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in dorothy’s room at night to take the shoes and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark so she never came near when dorothy was bathing indeed the old witch never touched water nor ever let water touch her in any way  but the wicked creature was very cunning and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted she placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes so that when dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar not being able to see it and fell at full length she was not much hurt but in her fall one of the silver shoes came off and before she could reach it the witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot  the wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm and dorothy could not use it against her even had she known how to do so  the little girl seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes grew angry and said to the witch give me back my shoe  i will not retorted the witch for it is now my shoe and not yours  you are a wicked creature cried dorothy you have no right to take my shoe from me  i shall keep it just the same said the witch laughing at her and someday i shall get the other one from you too  this made dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the witch wetting her from head to foot  instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear and then as dorothy looked at her in wonder the witch began to shrink and fall away  see what you have done she screamed in a minute i shall melt away  i’m very sorry indeed said dorothy who was truly frightened to see the witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes  didn’t you know water would be the end of me asked the witch in a wailing despairing voice  of course not answered dorothy how should i  well in a few minutes i shall be all melted and you will have the castle to yourself i have been wicked in my day but i never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds look out—here i go  with these words the witch fell down in a brown melted shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor seeing that she had really melted away to nothing dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess she then swept it all out the door after picking out the silver shoe which was all that was left of the old woman she cleaned and dried it with a cloth and put it on her foot again then being at last free to do as she chose she ran out to the courtyard to tell the lion that the wicked witch of the west had come to an end and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land     chapter xiii the rescue   the cowardly lion was much pleased to hear that the wicked witch had been melted by a bucket of water and dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free they went in together to the castle where dorothy’s first act was to call all the winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves  there was great rejoicing among the yellow winkies for they had been made to work hard during many years for the wicked witch who had always treated them with great cruelty they kept this day as a holiday then and ever after and spent the time in feasting and dancing  if our friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman were only with us said the lion i should be quite happy  don’t you suppose we could rescue them asked the girl anxiously  we can try answered the lion  so they called the yellow winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends and the winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for dorothy who had set them free from bondage so she chose a number of the winkies who looked as if they knew the most and they all started away they traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the tin woodman lay all battered and bent his axe was near him but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short  the winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms and carried him back to the yellow castle again dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend and the lion looking sober and sorry when they reached the castle dorothy said to the winkies   are any of your people tinsmiths  oh yes some of us are very good tinsmiths they told her  then bring them to me she said and when the tinsmiths came bringing with them all their tools in baskets she inquired can you straighten out those dents in the tin woodman and bend him back into shape again and solder him together where he is broken  the tinsmiths looked the woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever so they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the tin woodman until at last he was straightened out into his old form and his joints worked as well as ever to be sure there were several patches on him but the tinsmiths did a good job and as the woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all  when at last he walked into dorothy’s room and thanked her for rescuing him he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy and dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron so his joints would not be rusted at the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again and these tears did not need to be wiped away as for the lion he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried  if we only had the scarecrow with us again said the tin woodman when dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened i should be quite happy  we must try to find him said the girl  so she called the winkies to help her and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the winged monkeys had tossed the scarecrow’s clothes  it was a very tall tree and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it but the woodman said at once i’ll chop it down and then we can get the scarecrow’s clothes  now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the woodman himself another of the winkies who was a goldsmith had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the woodman’s axe instead of the old broken handle others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver  as soon as he had spoken the tin woodman began to chop and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash whereupon the scarecrow’s clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground  dorothy picked them up and had the winkies carry them back to the castle where they were stuffed with nice clean straw and behold here was the scarecrow as good as ever thanking them over and over again for saving him  now that they were reunited dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the yellow castle where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable  but one day the girl thought of aunt em and said we must go back to oz and claim his promise  yes said the woodman at last i shall get my heart  and i shall get my brains added the scarecrow joyfully  and i shall get my courage said the lion thoughtfully  and i shall get back to kansas cried dorothy clapping her hands oh let us start for the emerald city tomorrow  this they decided to do the next day they called the winkies together and bade them good-bye the winkies were sorry to have them go and they had grown so fond of the tin woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the yellow land of the west finding they were determined to go the winkies gave toto and the lion each a golden collar and to dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds and to the scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick to keep him from stumbling and to the tin woodman they offered a silver oil-can inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels  every one of the travelers made the winkies a pretty speech in return and all shook hands with them until their arms ached  dorothy went to the witch’s cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey and there she saw the golden cap she tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly she did not know anything about the charm of the golden cap but she saw that it was pretty so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket  then being prepared for the journey they all started for the emerald city and the winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them     chapter xiv the winged monkeys   you will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the castle of the wicked witch and the emerald city when the four travelers went in search of the witch she had seen them coming and so sent the winged monkeys to bring them to her it was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried they knew of course they must go straight east toward the rising sun and they started off in the right way but at noon when the sun was over their heads they did not know which was east and which was west and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields they kept on walking however and at night the moon came out and shone brightly so they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the scarecrow and the tin woodman  the next morning the sun was behind a cloud but they started on as if they were quite sure which way they were going  if we walk far enough said dorothy i am sure we shall sometime come to some place  but day by day passed away and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields the scarecrow began to grumble a bit  we have surely lost our way he said and unless we find it again in time to reach the emerald city i shall never get my brains  nor i my heart declared the tin woodman it seems to me i can scarcely wait till i get to oz and you must admit this is a very long journey  you see said the cowardly lion with a whimper i haven’t the courage to keep tramping forever without getting anywhere at all  then dorothy lost heart she sat down on the grass and looked at her companions and they sat down and looked at her and toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head so he put out his tongue and panted and looked at dorothy as if to ask what they should do next  suppose we call the field mice she suggested they could probably tell us the way to the emerald city  to be sure they could cried the scarecrow why didn’t we think of that before  dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the queen of the mice had given it to her in a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet and many of the small gray mice came running up to her among them was the queen herself who asked in her squeaky little voice   what can i do for my friends  we have lost our way said dorothy can you tell us where the emerald city is  certainly answered the queen but it is a great way off for you have had it at your backs all this time then she noticed dorothy’s golden cap and said why don’t you use the charm of the cap and call the winged monkeys to you they will carry you to the city of oz in less than an hour  i didn’t know there was a charm answered dorothy in surprise what is it  it is written inside the golden cap replied the queen of the mice but if you are going to call the winged monkeys we must run away for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us  won’t they hurt me asked the girl anxiously  oh no they must obey the wearer of the cap good-bye and she scampered out of sight with all the mice hurrying after her  dorothy looked inside the golden cap and saw some words written upon the lining these she thought must be the charm so she read the directions carefully and put the cap upon her head  ep-pe pep-pe kak-ke she said standing on her left foot  what did you say asked the scarecrow who did not know what she was doing  hil-lo hol-lo hel-lo dorothy went on standing this time on her right foot  hello replied the tin woodman calmly  ziz-zy zuz-zy zik said dorothy who was now standing on both feet this ended the saying of the charm and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings as the band of winged monkeys flew up to them  the king bowed low before dorothy and asked what is your command  we wish to go to the emerald city said the child and we have lost our way  we will carry you replied the king and no sooner had he spoken than two of the monkeys caught dorothy in their arms and flew away with her others took the scarecrow and the woodman and the lion and one little monkey seized toto and flew after them although the dog tried hard to bite him  the scarecrow and the tin woodman were rather frightened at first for they remembered how badly the winged monkeys had treated them before but they saw that no harm was intended so they rode through the air quite cheerfully and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them  dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest monkeys one of them the king himself they had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her  why do you have to obey the charm of the golden cap she asked  that is a long story answered the king with a winged laugh but as we have a long journey before us i will pass the time by telling you about it if you wish  i shall be glad to hear it she replied  once began the leader we were a free people living happily in the great forest flying from tree to tree eating nuts and fruit and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings chasing birds and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest but we were careless and happy and full of fun and enjoyed every minute of the day this was many years ago long before oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land  there lived here then away at the north a beautiful princess who was also a powerful sorceress all her magic was used to help the people and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good her name was gayelette and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby everyone loved her but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise at last however she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish when he grew to manhood quelala as he was called was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land while his manly beauty was so great that gayelette loved him dearly and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding  my grandfather was at that time the king of the winged monkeys which lived in the forest near gayelette’s palace and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner one day just before the wedding my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw quelala walking beside the river he was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do at his word the band flew down and seized quelala carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river and then dropped him into the water  ‘swim out my fine fellow’ cried my grandfather ‘and see if the water has spotted your clothes’ quelala was much too wise not to swim and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune he laughed when he came to the top of the water and swam in to shore but when gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river  the princess was angry and she knew of course who did it she had all the winged monkeys brought before her and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated quelala and dropped in the river but my grandfather pleaded hard for he knew the monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied and quelala said a kind word for them also so that gayelette finally spared them on condition that the winged monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the golden cap this cap had been made for a wedding present to quelala and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom of course my grandfather and all the other monkeys at once agreed to the condition and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the golden cap whosoever he may be  and what became of them asked dorothy who had been greatly interested in the story  quelala being the first owner of the golden cap replied the monkey he was the first to lay his wishes upon us as his bride could not bear the sight of us he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a winged monkey which we were glad to do for we were all afraid of her  this was all we ever had to do until the golden cap fell into the hands of the wicked witch of the west who made us enslave the winkies and afterward drive oz himself out of the land of the west now the golden cap is yours and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us  as the monkey king finished his story dorothy looked down and saw the green shining walls of the emerald city before them she wondered at the rapid flight of the monkeys but was glad the journey was over the strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the city the king bowed low to dorothy and then flew swiftly away followed by all his band  that was a good ride said the little girl  yes and a quick way out of our troubles replied the lion how lucky it was you brought away that wonderful cap     chapter xv the discovery of oz the terrible   the four travelers walked up to the great gate of emerald city and rang the bell after ringing several times it was opened by the same guardian of the gates they had met before  what are you back again he asked in surprise  do you not see us answered the scarecrow  but i thought you had gone to visit the wicked witch of the west  we did visit her said the scarecrow  and she let you go again asked the man in wonder  she could not help it for she is melted explained the scarecrow  melted well that is good news indeed said the man who melted her  it was dorothy said the lion gravely  good gracious exclaimed the man and he bowed very low indeed before her  then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes just as he had done before afterward they passed on through the gate into the emerald city when the people heard from the guardian of the gates that dorothy had melted the wicked witch of the west they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the palace of oz  the soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door but he let them in at once and they were again met by the beautiful green girl who showed each of them to their old rooms at once so they might rest until the great oz was ready to receive them  the soldier had the news carried straight to oz that dorothy and the other travelers had come back again after destroying the wicked witch but oz made no reply they thought the great wizard would send for them at once but he did not they had no word from him the next day nor the next nor the next the waiting was tiresome and wearing and at last they grew vexed that oz should treat them in so poor a fashion after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery so the scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to oz saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the winged monkeys to help them and find out whether he kept his promises or not when the wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the throne room at four minutes after nine o’clock the next morning he had once met the winged monkeys in the land of the west and he did not wish to meet them again  the four travelers passed a sleepless night each thinking of the gift oz had promised to bestow on him dorothy fell asleep only once and then she dreamed she was in kansas where aunt em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again  promptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them and four minutes later they all went into the throne room of the great oz  of course each one of them expected to see the wizard in the shape he had taken before and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room they kept close to the door and closer to one another for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen oz take  presently they heard a solemn voice that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome and it said   i am oz the great and terrible why do you seek me  they looked again in every part of the room and then seeing no one dorothy asked where are you  i am everywhere answered the voice but to the eyes of common mortals i am invisible i will now seat myself upon my throne that you may converse with me indeed the voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself so they walked toward it and stood in a row while dorothy said   we have come to claim our promise o oz  what promise asked oz  you promised to send me back to kansas when the wicked witch was destroyed said the girl  and you promised to give me brains said the scarecrow  and you promised to give me a heart said the tin woodman  and you promised to give me courage said the cowardly lion  is the wicked witch really destroyed asked the voice and dorothy thought it trembled a little  yes she answered i melted her with a bucket of water  dear me said the voice how sudden well come to me tomorrow for i must have time to think it over  you’ve had plenty of time already said the tin woodman angrily  we shan’t wait a day longer said the scarecrow  you must keep your promises to us exclaimed dorothy  the lion thought it might be as well to frighten the wizard so he gave a large loud roar which was so fierce and dreadful that toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner as it fell with a crash they looked that way and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder for they saw standing in just the spot the screen had hidden a little old man with a bald head and a wrinkled face who seemed to be as much surprised as they were the tin woodman raising his axe rushed toward the little man and cried out who are you  i am oz the great and terrible said the little man in a trembling voice but don’t strike me—please don’t—and i’ll do anything you want me to  our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay  i thought oz was a great head said dorothy  and i thought oz was a lovely lady said the scarecrow  and i thought oz was a terrible beast said the tin woodman  and i thought oz was a ball of fire exclaimed the lion  no you are all wrong said the little man meekly i have been making believe  making believe cried dorothy are you not a great wizard  hush my dear he said don’t speak so loud or you will be overheard—and i should be ruined i’m supposed to be a great wizard  and aren’t you she asked  not a bit of it my dear i’m just a common man  you’re more than that said the scarecrow in a grieved tone you’re a humbug  exactly so declared the little man rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him i am a humbug  but this is terrible said the tin woodman how shall i ever get my heart  or i my courage asked the lion  or i my brains wailed the scarecrow wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve  my dear friends said oz i pray you not to speak of these little things think of me and the terrible trouble i’m in at being found out  doesn’t anyone else know you’re a humbug asked dorothy  no one knows it but you four—and myself replied oz i have fooled everyone so long that i thought i should never be found out it was a great mistake my ever letting you into the throne room usually i will not see even my subjects and so they believe i am something terrible  but i don’t understand said dorothy in bewilderment how was it that you appeared to me as a great head  that was one of my tricks answered oz step this way please and i will tell you all about it  he led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the throne room and they all followed him he pointed to one corner in which lay the great head made out of many thicknesses of paper and with a carefully painted face  this i hung from the ceiling by a wire said oz i stood behind the screen and pulled a thread to make the eyes move and the mouth open  but how about the voice she inquired  oh i am a ventriloquist said the little man i can throw the sound of my voice wherever i wish so that you thought it was coming out of the head here are the other things i used to deceive you he showed the scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely lady and the tin woodman saw that his terrible beast was nothing but a lot of skins sewn together with slats to keep their sides out as for the ball of fire the false wizard had hung that also from the ceiling it was really a ball of cotton but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely  really said the scarecrow you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug  i am—i certainly am answered the little man sorrowfully but it was the only thing i could do sit down please there are plenty of chairs and i will tell you my story  so they sat down and listened while he told the following tale  i was born in omaha—  why that isn’t very far from kansas cried dorothy  no but it’s farther from here he said shaking his head at her sadly when i grew up i became a ventriloquist and at that i was very well trained by a great master i can imitate any kind of a bird or beast here he mewed so like a kitten that toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was after a time continued oz i tired of that and became a balloonist  what is that asked dorothy  a man who goes up in a balloon on circus day so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus he explained  oh she said i know  well one day i went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted so that i couldn’t come down again it went way up above the clouds so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many many miles away for a day and a night i traveled through the air and on the morning of the second day i awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country  it came down gradually and i was not hurt a bit but i found myself in the midst of a strange people who seeing me come from the clouds thought i was a great wizard of course i let them think so because they were afraid of me and promised to do anything i wished them to  just to amuse myself and keep the good people busy i ordered them to build this city and my palace and they did it all willingly and well then i thought as the country was so green and beautiful i would call it the emerald city and to make the name fit better i put green spectacles on all the people so that everything they saw was green  but isn’t everything here green asked dorothy  no more than in any other city replied oz but when you wear green spectacles why of course everything you see looks green to you the emerald city was built a great many years ago for i was a young man when the balloon brought me here and i am a very old man now but my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an emerald city and it certainly is a beautiful place abounding in jewels and precious metals and every good thing that is needed to make one happy i have been good to the people and they like me but ever since this palace was built i have shut myself up and would not see any of them  one of my greatest fears was the witches for while i had no magical powers at all i soon found out that the witches were really able to do wonderful things there were four of them in this country and they ruled the people who live in the north and south and east and west fortunately the witches of the north and south were good and i knew they would do me no harm but the witches of the east and west were terribly wicked and had they not thought i was more powerful than they themselves they would surely have destroyed me as it was i lived in deadly fear of them for many years so you can imagine how pleased i was when i heard your house had fallen on the wicked witch of the east when you came to me i was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other witch but now that you have melted her i am ashamed to say that i cannot keep my promises  i think you are a very bad man said dorothy  oh no my dear i’m really a very good man but i’m a very bad wizard i must admit  can’t you give me brains asked the scarecrow  you don’t need them you are learning something every day a baby has brains but it doesn’t know much experience is the only thing that brings knowledge and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get  that may all be true said the scarecrow but i shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains  the false wizard looked at him carefully  well he said with a sigh i’m not much of a magician as i said but if you will come to me tomorrow morning i will stuff your head with brains i cannot tell you how to use them however you must find that out for yourself  oh thank you—thank you cried the scarecrow i’ll find a way to use them never fear  but how about my courage asked the lion anxiously  you have plenty of courage i am sure answered oz all you need is confidence in yourself there is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger the true courage is in facing danger when you are afraid and that kind of courage you have in plenty  perhaps i have but i’m scared just the same said the lion i shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid  very well i will give you that sort of courage tomorrow replied oz  how about my heart asked the tin woodman  why as for that answered oz i think you are wrong to want a heart it makes most people unhappy if you only knew it you are in luck not to have a heart  that must be a matter of opinion said the tin woodman for my part i will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur if you will give me the heart  very well answered oz meekly come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart i have played wizard for so many years that i may as well continue the part a little longer  and now said dorothy how am i to get back to kansas  we shall have to think about that replied the little man give me two or three days to consider the matter and i’ll try to find a way to carry you over the desert in the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests and while you live in the palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish there is only one thing i ask in return for my help—such as it is you must keep my secret and tell no one i am a humbug  they agreed to say nothing of what they had learned and went back to their rooms in high spirits even dorothy had hope that the great and terrible humbug as she called him would find a way to send her back to kansas and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything     chapter xvi the magic art of the great humbug   next morning the scarecrow said to his friends   congratulate me i am going to oz to get my brains at last when i return i shall be as other men are  i have always liked you as you were said dorothy simply  it is kind of you to like a scarecrow he replied but surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the throne room where he rapped upon the door  come in said oz  the scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window engaged in deep thought  i have come for my brains remarked the scarecrow a little uneasily  oh yes sit down in that chair please replied oz you must excuse me for taking your head off but i shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place  that’s all right said the scarecrow you are quite welcome to take my head off as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again  so the wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran which he mixed with a great many pins and needles having shaken them together thoroughly he filled the top of the scarecrow’s head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw to hold it in place  when he had fastened the scarecrow’s head on his body again he said to him hereafter you will be a great man for i have given you a lot of bran-new brains  the scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish and having thanked oz warmly he went back to his friends  dorothy looked at him curiously his head was quite bulged out at the top with brains  how do you feel she asked  i feel wise indeed he answered earnestly when i get used to my brains i shall know everything  why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head asked the tin woodman  that is proof that he is sharp remarked the lion  well i must go to oz and get my heart said the woodman so he walked to the throne room and knocked at the door  come in called oz and the woodman entered and said i have come for my heart  very well answered the little man but i shall have to cut a hole in your breast so i can put your heart in the right place i hope it won’t hurt you  oh no answered the woodman i shall not feel it at all  so oz brought a pair of tinsmith’s shears and cut a small square hole in the left side of the tin woodman’s breast then going to a chest of drawers he took out a pretty heart made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust  isn’t it a beauty he asked  it is indeed replied the woodman who was greatly pleased but is it a kind heart  oh very answered oz he put the heart in the woodman’s breast and then replaced the square of tin soldering it neatly together where it had been cut  there said he now you have a heart that any man might be proud of i’m sorry i had to put a patch on your breast but it really couldn’t be helped  never mind the patch exclaimed the happy woodman i am very grateful to you and shall never forget your kindness  don’t speak of it replied oz  then the tin woodman went back to his friends who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune  the lion now walked to the throne room and knocked at the door  come in said oz  i have come for my courage announced the lion entering the room  very well answered the little man i will get it for you  he went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish beautifully carved placing this before the cowardly lion who sniffed at it as if he did not like it the wizard said   drink  what is it asked the lion  well answered oz if it were inside of you it would be courage you know of course that courage is always inside one so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it therefore i advise you to drink it as soon as possible  the lion hesitated no longer but drank till the dish was empty  how do you feel now asked oz  full of courage replied the lion who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune  oz left to himself smiled to think of his success in giving the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion exactly what they thought they wanted how can i help being a humbug he said when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done it was easy to make the scarecrow and the lion and the woodman happy because they imagined i could do anything but it will take more than imagination to carry dorothy back to kansas and i’m sure i don’t know how it can be done     chapter xvii how the balloon was launched   for three days dorothy heard nothing from oz these were sad days for the little girl although her friends were all quite happy and contented the scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself when the tin woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast and he told dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh the lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce kalidahs  thus each of the little party was satisfied except dorothy who longed more than ever to get back to kansas  on the fourth day to her great joy oz sent for her and when she entered the throne room he greeted her pleasantly   sit down my dear i think i have found the way to get you out of this country  and back to kansas she asked eagerly  well i’m not sure about kansas said oz for i haven’t the faintest notion which way it lies but the first thing to do is to cross the desert and then it should be easy to find your way home  how can i cross the desert she inquired  well i’ll tell you what i think said the little man you see when i came to this country it was in a balloon you also came through the air being carried by a cyclone so i believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air now it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone but i’ve been thinking the matter over and i believe i can make a balloon  how asked dorothy  a balloon said oz is made of silk which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it i have plenty of silk in the palace so it will be no trouble to make the balloon but in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with to make it float  if it won’t float remarked dorothy it will be of no use to us  true answered oz but there is another way to make it float which is to fill it with hot air hot air isn’t as good as gas for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert and we should be lost  we exclaimed the girl are you going with me  yes of course replied oz i am tired of being such a humbug if i should go out of this palace my people would soon discover i am not a wizard and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them so i have to stay shut up in these rooms all day and it gets tiresome i’d much rather go back to kansas with you and be in a circus again  i shall be glad to have your company said dorothy  thank you he answered now if you will help me sew the silk together we will begin to work on our balloon  so dorothy took a needle and thread and as fast as oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together first there was a strip of light green silk then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green for oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them it took three days to sew all the strips together but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long  then oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue to make it airtight after which he announced that the balloon was ready  but we must have a basket to ride in he said so he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon  when it was all ready oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother wizard who lived in the clouds the news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight  oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the palace and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity the tin woodman had chopped a big pile of wood and now he made a fire of it and oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air until finally the basket just touched the ground  then oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice   i am now going away to make a visit while i am gone the scarecrow will rule over you i command you to obey him as you would me  the balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground for the air within it was hot and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky  come dorothy cried the wizard hurry up or the balloon will fly away  i can’t find toto anywhere replied dorothy who did not wish to leave her little dog behind toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten and dorothy at last found him she picked him up and ran towards the balloon  she was within a few steps of it and oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket when crack went the ropes and the balloon rose into the air without her  come back she screamed i want to go too  i can’t come back my dear called oz from the basket good-bye  good-bye shouted everyone and all eyes were turned upward to where the wizard was riding in the basket rising every moment farther and farther into the sky  and that was the last any of them ever saw of oz the wonderful wizard though he may have reached omaha safely and be there now for all we know but the people remembered him lovingly and said to one another   oz was always our friend when he was here he built for us this beautiful emerald city and now he is gone he has left the wise scarecrow to rule over us  still for many days they grieved over the loss of the wonderful wizard and would not be comforted     chapter xviii away to the south   dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to kansas again but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon and she also felt sorry at losing oz and so did her companions  the tin woodman came to her and said   truly i should be ungrateful if i failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart i should like to cry a little because oz is gone if you will kindly wipe away my tears so that i shall not rust  with pleasure she answered and brought a towel at once then the tin woodman wept for several minutes and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel when he had finished he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can to guard against mishap  the scarecrow was now the ruler of the emerald city and although he was not a wizard the people were proud of him for they said there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man and so far as they knew they were quite right  the morning after the balloon had gone up with oz the four travelers met in the throne room and talked matters over the scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him  we are not so unlucky said the new ruler for this palace and the emerald city belong to us and we can do just as we please when i remember that a short time ago i was up on a pole in a farmer’s cornfield and that now i am the ruler of this beautiful city i am quite satisfied with my lot  i also said the tin woodman am well-pleased with my new heart and really that was the only thing i wished in all the world  for my part i am content in knowing i am as brave as any beast that ever lived if not braver said the lion modestly  if dorothy would only be contented to live in the emerald city continued the scarecrow we might all be happy together  but i don’t want to live here cried dorothy i want to go to kansas and live with aunt em and uncle henry  well then what can be done inquired the woodman  the scarecrow decided to think and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains finally he said   why not call the winged monkeys and ask them to carry you over the desert  i never thought of that said dorothy joyfully it’s just the thing i’ll go at once for the golden cap  when she brought it into the throne room she spoke the magic words and soon the band of winged monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her  this is the second time you have called us said the monkey king bowing before the little girl what do you wish  i want you to fly with me to kansas said dorothy  but the monkey king shook his head  that cannot be done he said we belong to this country alone and cannot leave it there has never been a winged monkey in kansas yet and i suppose there never will be for they don’t belong there we shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power but we cannot cross the desert good-bye  and with another bow the monkey king spread his wings and flew away through the window followed by all his band  dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment i have wasted the charm of the golden cap to no purpose she said for the winged monkeys cannot help me  it is certainly too bad said the tender-hearted woodman  the scarecrow was thinking again and his head bulged out so horribly that dorothy feared it would burst  let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers he said and ask his advice  so the soldier was summoned and entered the throne room timidly for while oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door  this little girl said the scarecrow to the soldier wishes to cross the desert how can she do so  i cannot tell answered the soldier for nobody has ever crossed the desert unless it is oz himself  is there no one who can help me asked dorothy earnestly  glinda might he suggested  who is glinda inquired the scarecrow  the witch of the south she is the most powerful of all the witches and rules over the quadlings besides her castle stands on the edge of the desert so she may know a way to cross it  glinda is a good witch isn’t she asked the child  the quadlings think she is good said the soldier and she is kind to everyone i have heard that glinda is a beautiful woman who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived  how can i get to her castle asked dorothy  the road is straight to the south he answered but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers there are wild beasts in the woods and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country for this reason none of the quadlings ever come to the emerald city  the soldier then left them and the scarecrow said   it seems in spite of dangers that the best thing dorothy can do is to travel to the land of the south and ask glinda to help her for of course if dorothy stays here she will never get back to kansas  you must have been thinking again remarked the tin woodman  i have said the scarecrow  i shall go with dorothy declared the lion for i am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again i am really a wild beast you know besides dorothy will need someone to protect her  that is true agreed the woodman my axe may be of service to her so i also will go with her to the land of the south  when shall we start asked the scarecrow  are you going they asked in surprise  certainly if it wasn’t for dorothy i should never have had brains she lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the emerald city so my good luck is all due to her and i shall never leave her until she starts back to kansas for good and all  thank you said dorothy gratefully you are all very kind to me but i should like to start as soon as possible  we shall go tomorrow morning returned the scarecrow so now let us all get ready for it will be a long journey     chapter xix attacked by the fighting trees   the next morning dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers who had walked with them as far as the gate when the guardian of the gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful city to get into new trouble but he at once unlocked their spectacles which he put back into the green box and gave them many good wishes to carry with them  you are now our ruler he said to the scarecrow so you must come back to us as soon as possible  i certainly shall if i am able the scarecrow replied but i must help dorothy to get home first  as dorothy bade the good-natured guardian a last farewell she said   i have been very kindly treated in your lovely city and everyone has been good to me i cannot tell you how grateful i am  don’t try my dear he answered we should like to keep you with us but if it is your wish to return to kansas i hope you will find a way he then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey  the sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the land of the south they were all in the best of spirits and laughed and chatted together dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were glad to be of use to her as for the lion he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again while toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies barking merrily all the time  city life does not agree with me at all remarked the lion as they walked along at a brisk pace i have lost much flesh since i lived there and now i am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous i have grown  they now turned and took a last look at the emerald city all they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls and high up above everything the spires and dome of the palace of oz  oz was not such a bad wizard after all said the tin woodman as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast  he knew how to give me brains and very good brains too said the scarecrow  if oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me added the lion he would have been a brave man  dorothy said nothing oz had not kept the promise he made her but he had done his best so she forgave him as he said he was a good man even if he was a bad wizard  the first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the emerald city on every side they slept that night on the grass with nothing but the stars over them and they rested very well indeed  in the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood there was no way of going around it for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see and besides they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost so they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest  the scarecrow who was in the lead finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath so he walked forward to the tree but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers  this did not hurt the scarecrow but it surprised him and he looked rather dizzy when dorothy picked him up  here is another space between the trees called the lion  let me try it first said the scarecrow for it doesn’t hurt me to get thrown about he walked up to another tree as he spoke but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again  this is strange exclaimed dorothy what shall we do  the trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us and stop our journey remarked the lion  i believe i will try it myself said the woodman and shouldering his axe he marched up to the first tree that had handled the scarecrow so roughly when a big branch bent down to seize him the woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two at once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain and the tin woodman passed safely under it  come on he shouted to the others be quick they all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury except toto who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled but the woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free  the other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches and that probably these were the policemen of the forest and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it  the four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood then to their surprise they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china it was smooth like the surface of a dish and higher than their heads  what shall we do now asked dorothy  i will make a ladder said the tin woodman for we certainly must climb over the wall     chapter xx the dainty china country   while the woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest dorothy lay down and slept for she was tired by the long walk the lion also curled himself up to sleep and toto lay beside him  the scarecrow watched the woodman while he worked and said to him   i cannot think why this wall is here nor what it is made of  rest your brains and do not worry about the wall replied the woodman when we have climbed over it we shall know what is on the other side  after a time the ladder was finished it looked clumsy but the tin woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose the scarecrow waked dorothy and the lion and toto and told them that the ladder was ready the scarecrow climbed up the ladder first but he was so awkward that dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off when he got his head over the top of the wall the scarecrow said oh my  go on exclaimed dorothy  so the scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall and dorothy put her head over and cried oh my just as the scarecrow had done  then toto came up and immediately began to bark but dorothy made him be still  the lion climbed the ladder next and the tin woodman came last but both of them cried oh my as soon as they looked over the wall when they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down and saw a strange sight  before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors these houses were quite small the biggest of them reaching only as high as dorothy’s waist there were also pretty little barns with china fences around them and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens all made of china were standing about in groups  but the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country there were milkmaids and shepherdesses with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them and golden buckles on their shoes and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads wearing ermine robes and satin doublets and funny clowns in ruffled gowns with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall pointed caps and strangest of all these people were all made of china even to their clothes and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than dorothy’s knee  no one did so much as look at the travelers at first except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice afterwards running away again  how shall we get down asked dorothy  they found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up so the scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet when all were safely down they picked up the scarecrow whose body was quite flattened out and patted his straw into shape again  we must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side said dorothy for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due south  they began walking through the country of the china people and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow as they drew near the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool the pail and even the milkmaid herself and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter  dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off and that the pail was lying in several small pieces while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow  there cried the milkmaid angrily see what you have done my cow has broken her leg and i must take her to the mender’s shop and have it glued on again what do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow  i’m very sorry returned dorothy please forgive us  but the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer she picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away the poor animal limping on three legs as she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers holding her nicked elbow close to her side  dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap  we must be very careful here said the kind-hearted woodman or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it  a little farther on dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young princess who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away  dorothy wanted to see more of the princess so she ran after her but the china girl cried out   don’t chase me don’t chase me  she had such a frightened little voice that dorothy stopped and said why not  because answered the princess also stopping a safe distance away if i run i may fall down and break myself  but could you not be mended asked the girl  oh yes but one is never so pretty after being mended you know replied the princess  i suppose not said dorothy  now there is mr joker one of our clowns continued the china lady who is always trying to stand upon his head he has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places and doesn’t look at all pretty here he comes now so you can see for yourself  indeed a jolly little clown came walking toward them and dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places  the clown put his hands in his pockets and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily he said       my lady fair    why do you stare at poor old mr joker     you’re quite as stiff     and prim as if you’d eaten up a poker   be quiet sir said the princess can’t you see these are strangers and should be treated with respect  well that’s respect i expect declared the clown and immediately stood upon his head  don’t mind mr joker said the princess to dorothy he is considerably cracked in his head and that makes him foolish  oh i don’t mind him a bit said dorothy but you are so beautiful she continued that i am sure i could love you dearly won’t you let me carry you back to kansas and stand you on aunt em’s mantel i could carry you in my basket  that would make me very unhappy answered the china princess you see here in our country we live contentedly and can talk and move around as we please but whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen and we can only stand straight and look pretty of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country  i would not make you unhappy for all the world exclaimed dorothy so i’ll just say good-bye  good-bye replied the princess  they walked carefully through the china country the little animals and all the people scampered out of their way fearing the strangers would break them and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall  it was not so high as the first however and by standing upon the lion’s back they all managed to scramble to the top then the lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall but just as he jumped he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces  that was too bad said dorothy but really i think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow’s leg and a church they are all so brittle  they are indeed said the scarecrow and i am thankful i am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged there are worse things in the world than being a scarecrow     chapter xxi the lion becomes the king of beasts   after climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall rank grass it was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight however by carefully picking their way they got safely along until they reached solid ground but here the country seemed wilder than ever and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen  this forest is perfectly delightful declared the lion looking around him with joy never have i seen a more beautiful place  it seems gloomy said the scarecrow  not a bit of it answered the lion i should like to live here all my life see how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home  perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now said dorothy  i suppose there are returned the lion but i do not see any of them about  they walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther dorothy and toto and the lion lay down to sleep while the woodman and the scarecrow kept watch over them as usual  when morning came they started again before they had gone far they heard a low rumble as of the growling of many wild animals toto whimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety there were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history and for a moment dorothy was afraid but the lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble  as he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic the biggest of the tigers came up to the lion and bowed saying   welcome o king of beasts you have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more  what is your trouble asked the lion quietly  we are all threatened answered the tiger by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest it is a most tremendous monster like a great spider with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk it has eight of these long legs and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth where he eats it as a spider does a fly not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us  the lion thought for a moment  are there any other lions in this forest he asked  no there were some but the monster has eaten them all and besides they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you  if i put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as king of the forest inquired the lion  we will do that gladly returned the tiger and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar  we will  where is this great spider of yours now asked the lion  yonder among the oak trees said the tiger pointing with his forefoot  take good care of these friends of mine said the lion and i will go at once to fight the monster  he bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy  the great spider was lying asleep when the lion found him and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said and its body covered with coarse black hair it had a great mouth with a row of sharp teeth a foot long but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp’s waist this gave the lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster’s back then with one blow of his heavy paw all armed with sharp claws he knocked the spider’s head from its body jumping down he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling when he knew it was quite dead  the lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly   you need fear your enemy no longer  then the beasts bowed down to the lion as their king and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as dorothy was safely on her way to kansas     chapter xxii the country of the quadlings   the four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock  that will be a hard climb said the scarecrow but we must get over the hill nevertheless  so he led the way and the others followed they had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out keep back  who are you asked the scarecrow  then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said this hill belongs to us and we don’t allow anyone to cross it  but we must cross it said the scarecrow we’re going to the country of the quadlings  but you shall not replied the voice and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen  he was quite short and stout and had a big head which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles but he had no arms at all and seeing this the scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill so he said i’m sorry not to do as you wish but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not and he walked boldly forward  as quick as lightning the man’s head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head where it was flat struck the scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling over and over down the hill almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body and the man laughed harshly as he said it isn’t as easy as you think  a chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks and dorothy saw hundreds of the armless hammer-heads upon the hillside one behind every rock  the lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the scarecrow’s mishap and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill  again a head shot swiftly out and the great lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball  dorothy ran down and helped the scarecrow to his feet and the lion came up to her feeling rather bruised and sore and said it is useless to fight people with shooting heads no one can withstand them  what can we do then she asked  call the winged monkeys suggested the tin woodman you have still the right to command them once more  very well she answered and putting on the golden cap she uttered the magic words the monkeys were as prompt as ever and in a few moments the entire band stood before her  what are your commands inquired the king of the monkeys bowing low  carry us over the hill to the country of the quadlings answered the girl  it shall be done said the king and at once the winged monkeys caught the four travelers and toto up in their arms and flew away with them as they passed over the hill the hammer-heads yelled with vexation and shot their heads high in the air but they could not reach the winged monkeys which carried dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the quadlings  this is the last time you can summon us said the leader to dorothy so good-bye and good luck to you  good-bye and thank you very much returned the girl and the monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling  the country of the quadlings seemed rich and happy there was field upon field of ripening grain with well-paved roads running between and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them the fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the winkies and blue in the country of the munchkins the quadlings themselves who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured were dressed all in red which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain  the monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door it was opened by the farmer’s wife and when dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies and a bowl of milk for toto  how far is it to the castle of glinda asked the child  it is not a great way answered the farmer’s wife take the road to the south and you will soon reach it  thanking the good woman they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful castle before the gates were three young girls dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid and as dorothy approached one of them said to her   why have you come to the south country  to see the good witch who rules here she answered will you take me to her  let me have your name and i will ask glinda if she will receive you they told who they were and the girl soldier went into the castle after a few moments she came back to say that dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once     chapter xxiii glinda the good witch grants dorothy’s wish   before they went to see glinda however they were taken to a room of the castle where dorothy washed her face and combed her hair and the lion shook the dust out of his mane and the scarecrow patted himself into his best shape and the woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints  when they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the witch glinda sat upon a throne of rubies  she was both beautiful and young to their eyes her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue and they looked kindly upon the little girl  what can i do for you my child she asked  dorothy told the witch all her story  how the cyclone had brought her to the land of oz how she had found her companions and of the wonderful adventures they had met with  my greatest wish now she added is to get back to kansas for aunt em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me and that will make her put on mourning and unless the crops are better this year than they were last i am sure uncle henry cannot afford it  glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet upturned face of the loving little girl  bless your dear heart she said i am sure i can tell you of a way to get back to kansas then she added but if i do you must give me the golden cap  willingly exclaimed dorothy indeed it is of no use to me now and when you have it you can command the winged monkeys three times  and i think i shall need their service just those three times answered glinda smiling  dorothy then gave her the golden cap and the witch said to the scarecrow what will you do when dorothy has left us  i will return to the emerald city he replied for oz has made me its ruler and the people like me the only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the hammer-heads  by means of the golden cap i shall command the winged monkeys to carry you to the gates of the emerald city said glinda for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler  am i really wonderful asked the scarecrow  you are unusual replied glinda  turning to the tin woodman she asked what will become of you when dorothy leaves this country  he leaned on his axe and thought a moment then he said the winkies were very kind to me and wanted me to rule over them after the wicked witch died i am fond of the winkies and if i could get back again to the country of the west i should like nothing better than to rule over them forever  my second command to the winged monkeys said glinda will be that they carry you safely to the land of the winkies your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the scarecrow but you are really brighter than he is—when you are well polished—and i am sure you will rule the winkies wisely and well  then the witch looked at the big shaggy lion and asked when dorothy has returned to her own home what will become of you  over the hill of the hammer-heads he answered lies a grand old forest and all the beasts that live there have made me their king if i could only get back to this forest i would pass my life very happily there  my third command to the winged monkeys said glinda shall be to carry you to your forest then having used up the powers of the golden cap i shall give it to the king of the monkeys that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore  the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion now thanked the good witch earnestly for her kindness and dorothy exclaimed   you are certainly as good as you are beautiful but you have not yet told me how to get back to kansas  your silver shoes will carry you over the desert replied glinda if you had known their power you could have gone back to your aunt em the very first day you came to this country  but then i should not have had my wonderful brains cried the scarecrow i might have passed my whole life in the farmer’s cornfield  and i should not have had my lovely heart said the tin woodman i might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world  and i should have lived a coward forever declared the lion and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me  this is all true said dorothy and i am glad i was of use to these good friends but now that each of them has had what he most desired and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides i think i should like to go back to kansas  the silver shoes said the good witch have wonderful powers and one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps and each step will be made in the wink of an eye all you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go  if that is so said the child joyfully i will ask them to carry me back to kansas at once  she threw her arms around the lion’s neck and kissed him patting his big head tenderly then she kissed the tin woodman who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints but she hugged the soft stuffed body of the scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades  glinda the good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss and dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself  dorothy now took toto up solemnly in her arms and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times saying   take me home to aunt em   instantly she was whirling through the air so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears  the silver shoes took but three steps and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was  at length however she sat up and looked about her  good gracious she cried  for she was sitting on the broad kansas prairie and just before her was the new farmhouse uncle henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one uncle henry was milking the cows in the barnyard and toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn barking furiously  dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet for the silver shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air and were lost forever in the desert     chapter xxiv home again   aunt em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw dorothy running toward her  my darling child she cried folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses where in the world did you come from  from the land of oz said dorothy gravely and here is toto too and oh aunt em i’m so glad to be at home again,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,L.Frank Baum
at the back of the north wind   chapter i the hay-loft   i have been asked to tell you about the back of the north wind an old greek writer mentions a people who lived there and were so comfortable that they could not bear it any longer and drowned themselves my story is not the same as his i do not think herodotus had got the right account of the place i am going to tell you how it fared with a boy who went there  he lived in a low room over a coach-house and that was not by any means at the back of the north wind as his mother very well knew for one side of the room was built only of boards and the boards were so old that you might run a penknife through into the north wind and then let them settle between them which was the sharper i know that when you pulled it out again the wind would be after it like a cat after a mouse and you would know soon enough you were not at the back of the north wind still this room was not very cold except when the north wind blew stronger than usual  the room i have to do with now was always cold except in summer when the sun took the matter into his own hands indeed i am not sure whether i ought to call it a room at all for it was just a loft where they kept hay and straw and oats for the horses  and when little diamond but stop  i must tell you that his father who was a coachman had named him after a favourite horse and his mother had had no objection  when little diamond then lay there in bed he could hear the horses under him munching away in the dark or moving sleepily in their dreams for diamond's father had built him a bed in the loft with boards all round it because they had so little room in their own end over the coach-house and diamond's father put old diamond in the stall under the bed because he was a quiet horse and did not go to sleep standing but lay down like a reasonable creature but although he was a surprisingly reasonable creature yet when young diamond woke in the middle of the night and felt the bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind he could not help wondering whether if the wind should blow the house down and he were to fall through into the manger old diamond mightn't eat him up before he knew him in his night-gown and although old diamond was very quiet all night long yet when he woke he got up like an earthquake and then young diamond knew what o'clock it was or at least what was to be done next which was to go to sleep again as fast as he could  there was hay at his feet and hay at his head piled up in great trusses to the very roof indeed it was sometimes only through a little lane with several turnings which looked as if it had been sawn out for him that he could reach his bed at all for the stock of hay was of course always in a state either of slow ebb or of sudden flow sometimes the whole space of the loft with the little panes in the roof for the stars to look in would lie open before his open eyes as he lay in bed sometimes a yellow wall of sweet-smelling fibres closed up his view at the distance of half a yard sometimes when his mother had undressed him in her room and told him to trot to bed by himself he would creep into the heart of the hay and lie there thinking how cold it was outside in the wind and how warm it was inside there in his bed and how he could go to it when he pleased only he wouldn't just yet he would get a little colder first and ever as he grew colder his bed would grow warmer till at last he would scramble out of the hay shoot like an arrow into his bed cover himself up and snuggle down thinking what a happy boy he was he had not the least idea that the wind got in at a chink in the wall and blew about him all night for the back of his bed was only of boards an inch thick and on the other side of them was the north wind  now as i have already said these boards were soft and crumbly to be sure they were tarred on the outside yet in many places they were more like tinder than timber hence it happened that the soft part having worn away from about it little diamond found one night after he lay down that a knot had come out of one of them and that the wind was blowing in upon him in a cold and rather imperious fashion now he had no fancy for leaving things wrong that might be set right so he jumped out of bed again got a little strike of hay twisted it up folded it in the middle and having thus made it into a cork stuck it into the hole in the wall but the wind began to blow loud and angrily and as diamond was falling asleep out blew his cork and hit him on the nose just hard enough to wake him up quite and let him hear the wind whistling shrill in the hole he searched for his hay-cork found it stuck it in harder and was just dropping off once more when pop with an angry whistle behind it the cork struck him again this time on the cheek up he rose once more made a fresh stopple of hay and corked the hole severely but he was hardly down again before pop it came on his forehead he gave it up drew the clothes above his head and was soon fast asleep  although the next day was very stormy diamond forgot all about the hole for he was busy making a cave by the side of his mother's fire with a broken chair a three-legged stool and a blanket and then sitting in it his mother however discovered it and pasted a bit of brown paper over it so that when diamond had snuggled down the next night he had no occasion to think of it  presently however he lifted his head and listened who could that be talking to him the wind was rising again and getting very loud and full of rushes and whistles he was sure some one was talking and very near him too it was but he was not frightened for he had not yet learned how to be so he sat up and hearkened at last the voice which though quite gentle sounded a little angry appeared to come from the back of the bed he crept nearer to it and laid his ear against the wall then he heard nothing but the wind which sounded very loud indeed the moment however that he moved his head from the wall he heard the voice again close to his ear he felt about with his hand and came upon the piece of paper his mother had pasted over the hole against this he laid his ear and then he heard the voice quite distinctly there was in fact a little corner of the paper loose and through that as from a mouth in the wall the voice came  what do you mean little boy closing up my window  what window asked diamond  you stuffed hay into it three times last night i had to blow it out again three times  you can't mean this little hole it isn't a window it's a hole in my bed  i did not say it was a window  i said it was my window  but it can't be a window because windows are holes to see out of  well that's just what i made this window for  but you are outside  you can't want a window  you are quite mistaken windows are to see out of you say well i'm in my house and i want windows to see out of it  but you've made a window into my bed  well your mother has got three windows into my dancing room and you have three into my garret  but i heard father say when my mother wanted him to make a window through the wall that it was against the law for it would look into mr dyves's garden  the voice laughed  the law would have some trouble to catch me it said  but if it's not right you know said diamond that's no matter you shouldn't do it  i am so tall i am above that law said the voice  you must have a tall house then said diamond  yes a tall house  the clouds are inside it  dear me said diamond and thought a minute i think then you can hardly expect me to keep a window in my bed for you why don't you make a window into mr dyves's bed  nobody makes a window into an ash-pit said the voice rather sadly i like to see nice things out of my windows  but he must have a nicer bed than i have though mine is very nice so nice that i couldn't wish a better  it's not the bed i care about  it's what is in it but you just open that window  well mother says i shouldn't be disobliging but it's rather hard you see the north wind will blow right in my face if i do  i am the north wind  o-o-oh said diamond thoughtfully then will you promise not to blow on my face if i open your window  i can't promise that  but you'll give me the toothache mother's got it already  but what's to become of me without a window  i'm sure i don't know all i say is it will be worse for me than for you  no it will not you shall not be the worse for it i promise you that you will be much the better for it just you believe what i say and do as i tell you  well i can pull the clothes over my head said diamond and feeling with his little sharp nails he got hold of the open edge of the paper and tore it off at once  in came a long whistling spear of cold and struck his little naked chest he scrambled and tumbled in under the bedclothes and covered himself up  there was no paper now between him and the voice and he felt a little not frightened exactly i told you he had not learned that yet but rather queer for what a strange person this north wind must be that lived in the great house called out-of-doors i suppose  thought diamond and made windows into people's beds but the voice began again and he could hear it quite plainly even with his head under the bed-clothes it was a still more gentle voice now although six times as large and loud as it had been and he thought it sounded a little like his mother's  what is your name little boy it asked  diamond answered diamond under the bed-clothes  what a funny name  it's a very nice name returned its owner  i don't know that said the voice  well i do retorted diamond a little rudely  do you know to whom you are speaking  no said diamond  and indeed he did not for to know a person's name is not always to know the person's self  then i must not be angry with you you had better look and see though  diamond is a very pretty name persisted the boy vexed that it should not give satisfaction  diamond is a useless thing rather said the voice  that's not true diamond is very nice as big as two and so quiet all night and doesn't he make a jolly row in the morning getting upon his four great legs it's like thunder  you don't seem to know what a diamond is  oh don't i just diamond is a great and good horse and he sleeps right under me he is old diamond and i am young diamond or if you like it better for you're very particular mr north wind he's big diamond and i'm little diamond and i don't know which of us my father likes best  a beautiful laugh large but very soft and musical sounded somewhere beside him but diamond kept his head under the clothes  i'm not mr north wind said the voice  you told me that you were the north wind insisted diamond  i did not say mister north wind said the voice  well then i do for mother tells me i ought to be polite  then let me tell you i don't think it at all polite of you to say mister to me  well i didn't know better i'm very sorry  but you ought to know better  i don't know that  i do you can't say it's polite to lie there talking with your head under the bed-clothes and never look up to see what kind of person you are talking to i want you to come out with me  i want to go to sleep said diamond very nearly crying for he did not like to be scolded even when he deserved it  you shall sleep all the better to-morrow night  besides said diamond you are out in mr dyves's garden and i can't get there i can only get into our own yard  will you take your head out of the bed-clothes said the voice just a little angrily  no answered diamond half peevish half frightened  the instant he said the word a tremendous blast of wind crashed in a board of the wall and swept the clothes off diamond he started up in terror leaning over him was the large beautiful pale face of a woman her dark eyes looked a little angry for they had just begun to flash but a quivering in her sweet upper lip made her look as if she were going to cry what was the most strange was that away from her head streamed out her black hair in every direction so that the darkness in the hay-loft looked as if it were made of her hair but as diamond gazed at her in speechless amazement mingled with confidence for the boy was entranced with her mighty beauty her hair began to gather itself out of the darkness and fell down all about her again till her face looked out of the midst of it like a moon out of a cloud from her eyes came all the light by which diamond saw her face and her hair and that was all he did see of her yet the wind was over and gone  will you go with me now you little diamond i am sorry i was forced to be so rough with you said the lady  i will yes i will answered diamond holding out both his arms but he added dropping them how shall i get my clothes they are in mother's room and the door is locked  oh never mind your clothes you will not be cold i shall take care of that nobody is cold with the north wind  i thought everybody was said diamond  that is a great mistake most people make it however they are cold because they are not with the north wind but without it  if diamond had been a little older and had supposed himself a good deal wiser he would have thought the lady was joking but he was not older and did not fancy himself wiser and therefore understood her well enough again he stretched out his arms the lady's face drew back a little  follow me diamond she said  yes said diamond only a little ruefully  you're not afraid said the north wind  no ma'am but mother never would let me go without shoes  she never said anything about clothes so i dare say she wouldn't mind that  i know your mother very well said the lady she is a good woman i have visited her often i was with her when you were born i saw her laugh and cry both at once i love your mother diamond  how was it you did not know my name then ma'am please am i to say ma'am to you ma'am  one question at a time dear boy i knew your name quite well but i wanted to hear what you would say for it don't you remember that day when the man was finding fault with your name how i blew the window in  yes yes answered diamond eagerly our window opens like a door right over the coach-house door and the wind you ma'am came in and blew the bible out of the man's hands and the leaves went all flutter flutter on the floor and my mother picked it up and gave it back to him open and there    was your name in the bible the sixth stone in the high priest's breastplate  oh a stone was it said diamond i thought it had been a horse i did  never mind a horse is better than a stone any day well you see i know all about you and your mother  yes i will go with you  now for the next question  you're not to call me ma'am you must call me just my own name respectfully you know just north wind  well please north wind you are so beautiful i am quite ready to go with you  you must not be ready to go with everything beautiful all at once diamond  but what's beautiful can't be bad you're not bad north wind  no i'm not bad but sometimes beautiful things grow bad by doing bad and it takes some time for their badness to spoil their beauty so little boys may be mistaken if they go after things because they are beautiful  well i will go with you because you are beautiful and good too  ah but there's another thing diamond  what if i should look ugly without being bad look ugly myself because i am making ugly things beautiful what then  i don't quite understand you north wind you tell me what then  well i will tell you if you see me with my face all black don't be frightened if you see me flapping wings like a bat's as big as the whole sky don't be frightened if you hear me raging ten times worse than mrs bill the blacksmith's wife even if you see me looking in at people's windows like mrs eve dropper the gardener's wife you must believe that i am doing my work nay diamond if i change into a serpent or a tiger you must not let go your hold of me for my hand will never change in yours if you keep a good hold if you keep a hold you will know who i am all the time even when you look at me and can't see me the least like the north wind i may look something very awful do you understand  quite well said little diamond  come along then said north wind and disappeared behind the mountain of hay  diamond crept out of bed and followed her     chapter ii the lawn   when diamond got round the corner of the hay for a moment he hesitated the stair by which he would naturally have gone down to the door was at the other side of the loft and looked very black indeed for it was full of north wind's hair as she descended before him and just beside him was the ladder going straight down into the stable up which his father always came to fetch the hay for diamond's dinner through the opening in the floor the faint gleam of the-stable lantern was enticing and diamond thought he would run down that way  the stair went close past the loose-box in which diamond the horse lived when diamond the boy was half-way down he remembered that it was of no use to go this way for the stable-door was locked but at the same moment there was horse diamond's great head poked out of his box on to the ladder for he knew boy diamond although he was in his night-gown and wanted him to pull his ears for him this diamond did very gently for a minute or so and patted and stroked his neck too and kissed the big horse and had begun to take the bits of straw and hay out of his mane when all at once he recollected that the lady north wind was waiting for him in the yard  good night diamond he said and darted up the ladder across the loft and down the stair to the door but when he got out into the yard there was no lady  now it is always a dreadful thing to think there is somebody and find nobody children in particular have not made up their minds to it they generally cry at nobody especially when they wake up at night but it was an especial disappointment to diamond for his little heart had been beating with joy  the face of the north wind was so grand to have a lady like that for a friend with such long hair too why it was longer than twenty diamonds' tails she was gone and there he stood with his bare feet on the stones of the paved yard  it was a clear night overhead and the stars were shining orion in particular was making the most of his bright belt and golden sword but the moon was only a poor thin crescent there was just one great jagged black and gray cloud in the sky with a steep side to it like a precipice and the moon was against this side and looked as if she had tumbled off the top of the cloud-hill and broken herself in rolling down the precipice she did not seem comfortable for she was looking down into the deep pit waiting for her at least that was what diamond thought as he stood for a moment staring at her but he was quite wrong for the moon was not afraid and there was no pit she was going down into for there were no sides to it and a pit without sides to it is not a pit at all diamond however had not been out so late before in all his life and things looked so strange about him just as if he had got into fairyland of which he knew quite as much as anybody for his mother had no money to buy books to set him wrong on the subject i have seen this world only sometimes just now and then you know look as strange as ever i saw fairyland but i confess that i have not yet seen fairyland at its best i am always going to see it so some time but if you had been out in the face and not at the back of the north wind on a cold rather frosty night and in your night-gown you would have felt it all quite as strange as diamond did he cried a little just a little he was so disappointed to lose the lady  of course you little man wouldn't have done that but for my part i don't mind people crying so much as i mind what they cry about and how they cry whether they cry quietly like ladies and gentlemen or go shrieking like vulgar emperors or ill-natured cooks for all emperors are not gentlemen and all cooks are not ladies nor all queens and princesses for that matter either  but it can't be denied that a little gentle crying does one good it did diamond good for as soon as it was over he was a brave boy again  she shan't say it was my fault anyhow said diamond i daresay she is hiding somewhere to see what i will do i will look for her  so he went round the end of the stable towards the kitchen-garden but the moment he was clear of the shelter of the stable sharp as a knife came the wind against his little chest and his bare legs still he would look in the kitchen-garden and went on but when he got round the weeping-ash that stood in the corner the wind blew much stronger and it grew stronger and stronger till he could hardly fight against it and it was so cold all the flashy spikes of the stars seemed to have got somehow into the wind then he thought of what the lady had said about people being cold because they were not with the north wind how it was that he should have guessed what she meant at that very moment i cannot tell but i have observed that the most wonderful thing in the world is how people come to understand anything he turned his back to the wind and trotted again towards the yard whereupon strange to say it blew so much more gently against his calves than it had blown against his shins that he began to feel almost warm by contrast  you must not think it was cowardly of diamond to turn his back to the wind  he did so only because he thought lady north wind had said something like telling him to do so if she had said to him that he must hold his face to it diamond would have held his face to it but the most foolish thing is to fight for no good and to please nobody  well it was just as if the wind was pushing diamond along if he turned round it grew very sharp on his legs especially and so he thought the wind might really be lady north wind though he could not see her and he had better let her blow him wherever she pleased so she blew and blew and he went and went until he found himself standing at a door in a wall which door led from the yard into a little belt of shrubbery flanking mr coleman's house mr coleman was his father's master and the owner of diamond he opened the door and went through the shrubbery and out into the middle of the lawn still hoping to find north wind the soft grass was very pleasant to his bare feet and felt warm after the stones of the yard but the lady was nowhere to be seen then he began to think that after all he must have done wrong and she was offended with him for not following close after her but staying to talk to the horse which certainly was neither wise nor polite  there he stood in the middle of the lawn the wind blowing his night-gown till it flapped like a loose sail the stars were very shiny over his head but they did not give light enough to show that the grass was green and diamond stood alone in the strange night which looked half solid all about him he began to wonder whether he was in a dream or not it was important to determine this for thought diamond if i am in a dream i am safe in my bed and i needn't cry but if i'm not in a dream i'm out here and perhaps i had better cry or at least i'm not sure whether i can help it he came to the conclusion however that whether he was in a dream or not there could be no harm in not crying for a little while longer  he could begin whenever he liked  the back of mr coleman's house was to the lawn and one of the drawing-room windows looked out upon it the ladies had not gone to bed for the light was still shining in that window but they had no idea that a little boy was standing on the lawn in his night-gown or they would have run out in a moment and as long as he saw that light diamond could not feel quite lonely he stood staring not at the great warrior orion in the sky nor yet at the disconsolate neglected moon going down in the west but at the drawing-room window with the light shining through its green curtains he had been in that room once or twice that he could remember at christmas times for the colemans were kind people though they did not care much about children  all at once the light went nearly out  he could only see a glimmer of the shape of the window then indeed he felt that he was left alone it was so dreadful to be out in the night after everybody was gone to bed that was more than he could bear he burst out crying in good earnest beginning with a wail like that of the wind when it is waking up  perhaps you think this was very foolish for could he not go home to his own bed again when he liked yes but it looked dreadful to him to creep up that stair again and lie down in his bed again and know that north wind's window was open beside him and she gone and he might never see her again he would be just as lonely there as here nay it would be much worse if he had to think that the window was nothing but a hole in the wall  at the very moment when he burst out crying the old nurse who had grown to be one of the family for she had not gone away when miss coleman did not want any more nursing came to the back door which was of glass to close the shutters she thought she heard a cry and peering out with a hand on each side of her eyes like diamond's blinkers she saw something white on the lawn too old and too wise to be frightened she opened the door and went straight towards the white thing to see what it was and when diamond saw her coming he was not frightened either though mrs crump was a little cross sometimes for there is a good kind of crossness that is only disagreeable and there is a bad kind of crossness that is very nasty indeed so she came up with her neck stretched out and her head at the end of it and her eyes foremost of all like a snail's peering into the night to see what it could be that went on glimmering white before her when she did see she made a great exclamation and threw up her hands then without a word for she thought diamond was walking in his sleep she caught hold of him and led him towards the house he made no objection for he was just in the mood to be grateful for notice of any sort and mrs crump led him straight into the drawing-room  now from the neglect of the new housemaid the fire in miss coleman's bedroom had gone out and her mother had told her to brush her hair by the drawing-room fire a disorderly proceeding which a mother's wish could justify the young lady was very lovely though not nearly so beautiful as north wind and her hair was extremely long for it came down to her knees though that was nothing at all to north wind's hair yet when she looked round with her hair all about her as diamond entered he thought for one moment that it was north wind and pulling his hand from mrs crump's he stretched out his arms and ran towards miss coleman she was so pleased that she threw down her brush and almost knelt on the floor to receive him in her arms he saw the next moment that she was not lady north wind but she looked so like her he could not help running into her arms and bursting into tears afresh mrs crump said the poor child had walked out in his sleep and diamond thought she ought to know and did not contradict her for anything he knew it might be so indeed he let them talk on about him and said nothing and when after their astonishment was over and miss coleman had given him a sponge-cake it was decreed that mrs crump should take him to his mother he was quite satisfied  his mother had to get out of bed to open the door when mrs crump knocked she was indeed surprised to see her boy and having taken him in her arms and carried him to his bed returned and had a long confabulation with mrs crump for they were still talking when diamond fell fast asleep and could hear them no longer     chapter iii old diamond   diamond woke very early in the morning and thought what a curious dream he had had but the memory grew brighter and brighter in his head until it did not look altogether like a dream and he began to doubt whether he had not really been abroad in the wind last night he came to the conclusion that if he had really been brought home to his mother by mrs crump she would say something to him about it and that would settle the matter then he got up and dressed himself but finding that his father and mother were not yet stirring he went down the ladder to the stable there he found that even old diamond was not awake yet for he as well as young diamond always got up the moment he woke and now he was lying as flat as a horse could lie upon his nice trim bed of straw  i'll give old diamond a surprise thought the boy and creeping up very softly before the horse knew he was astride of his back then it was young diamond's turn to have more of a surprise than he had expected for as with an earthquake with a rumbling and a rocking hither and thither a sprawling of legs and heaving as of many backs young diamond found himself hoisted up in the air with both hands twisted in the horse's mane the next instant old diamond lashed out with both his hind legs and giving one cry of terror young diamond found himself lying on his neck with his arms as far round it as they would go but then the horse stood as still as a stone except that he lifted his head gently up to let the boy slip down to his back for when he heard young diamond's cry he knew that there was nothing to kick about for young diamond was a good boy and old diamond was a good horse and the one was all right on the back of the other  as soon as diamond had got himself comfortable on the saddle place the horse began pulling at the hay and the boy began thinking he had never mounted diamond himself before and he had never got off him without being lifted down so he sat while the horse ate wondering how he was to reach the ground  but while he meditated his mother woke and her first thought was to see her boy she had visited him twice during the night and found him sleeping quietly now his bed was empty and she was frightened  diamond diamond where are you diamond she called out  diamond turned his head where he sat like a knight on his steed in enchanted stall and cried aloud   here mother  where diamond she returned  here mother on diamond's back  she came running to the ladder and peeping down saw him aloft on the great horse  come down diamond she said  i can't answered diamond  how did you get up asked his mother  quite easily answered he but when i got up diamond would get up too and so here i am  his mother thought he had been walking in his sleep again and hurried down the ladder she did not much like going up to the horse for she had not been used to horses but she would have gone into a lion's den not to say a horse's stall to help her boy so she went and lifted him off diamond's back and felt braver all her life after she carried him in her arms up to her room but afraid of frightening him at his own sleep-walking as she supposed it said nothing about last night before the next day was over diamond had almost concluded the whole adventure a dream  for a week his mother watched him very carefully going into the loft several times a night as often in fact as she woke every time she found him fast asleep  all that week it was hard weather the grass showed white in the morning with the hoar-frost which clung like tiny comfits to every blade and as diamond's shoes were not good and his mother had not quite saved up enough money to get him the new pair she so much wanted for him she would not let him run out he played all his games over and over indoors especially that of driving two chairs harnessed to the baby's cradle and if they did not go very fast they went as fast as could be expected of the best chairs in the world although one of them had only three legs and the other only half a back  at length his mother brought home his new shoes and no sooner did she find they fitted him than she told him he might run out in the yard and amuse himself for an hour  the sun was going down when he flew from the door like a bird from its cage all the world was new to him a great fire of sunset burned on the top of the gate that led from the stables to the house above the fire in the sky lay a large lake of green light above that a golden cloud and over that the blue of the wintry heavens and diamond thought that next to his own home he had never seen any place he would like so much to live in as that sky for it is not fine things that make home a nice place but your mother and your father  as he was looking at the lovely colours the gates were thrown open and there was old diamond and his friend in the carriage dancing with impatience to get at their stalls and their oats and in they came diamond was not in the least afraid of his father driving over him but careful not to spoil the grand show he made with his fine horses and his multitudinous cape with a red edge to every fold he slipped out of the way and let him dash right on to the stables to be quite safe he had to step into the recess of the door that led from the yard to the shrubbery  as he stood there he remembered how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream and once more he was almost sure that it was no dream at all events he would go in and see whether things looked at all now as they did then he opened the door and passed through the little belt of shrubbery not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn even the brave old chrysanthemums and christmas roses had passed away before the frost what yes there was one he ran and knelt down to look at it  it was a primrose a dwarfish thing but perfect in shape a baby-wonder as he stooped his face to see it close a little wind began to blow and two or three long leaves that stood up behind the flower shook and waved and quivered but the primrose lay still in the green hollow looking up at the sky and not seeming to know that the wind was blowing at all it was just a one eye that the dull black wintry earth had opened to look at the sky with all at once diamond thought it was saying its prayers and he ought not to be staring at it so he ran to the stable to see his father make diamond's bed then his father took him in his arms carried him up the ladder and set him down at the table where they were going to have their tea  miss is very poorly said diamond's father mis'ess has been to the doctor with her to-day and she looked very glum when she came out again i was a-watching of them to see what doctor had said  and didn't miss look glum too asked his mother  not half as glum as mis'ess returned the coachman you see   but he lowered his voice and diamond could not make out more than a word here and there for diamond's father was not only one of the finest of coachmen to look at and one of the best of drivers but one of the most discreet of servants as well therefore he did not talk about family affairs to any one but his wife whom he had proved better than himself long ago and was careful that even diamond should hear nothing he could repeat again concerning master and his family  it was bed-time soon and diamond went to bed and fell fast asleep  he awoke all at once in the dark  open the window diamond said a voice  now diamond's mother had once more pasted up north wind's window  are you north wind said diamond  i don't hear you blowing  no but you hear me talking open the window for i haven't overmuch time  yes returned diamond but please north wind where's the use you left me all alone last time  he had got up on his knees and was busy with his nails once more at the paper over the hole in the wall for now that north wind spoke again he remembered all that had taken place before as distinctly as if it had happened only last night  yes but that was your fault returned north wind i had work to do and besides a gentleman should never keep a lady waiting  but i'm not a gentleman said diamond scratching away at the paper  i hope you won't say so ten years after this  i'm going to be a coachman and a coachman is not a gentleman  persisted diamond  we call your father a gentleman in our house said north wind  he doesn't call himself one said diamond  that's of no consequence  every man ought to be a gentleman and your father is one  diamond was so pleased to hear this that he scratched at the paper like ten mice and getting hold of the edge of it tore it off the next instant a young girl glided across the bed and stood upon the floor  oh dear said diamond quite dismayed i didn't know who are you please  i'm north wind  are you really  yes make haste  but you're no bigger than me  do you think i care about how big or how little i am didn't you see me this evening i was less then  no where was you  behind the leaves of the primrose didn't you see them blowing  yes  make haste then if you want to go with me  but you are not big enough to take care of me i think you are only miss north wind  i am big enough to show you the way anyhow but if you won't come why you must stay  i must dress myself i didn't mind with a grown lady but i couldn't go with a little girl in my night-gown  very well i'm not in such a hurry as i was the other night dress as fast as you can and i'll go and shake the primrose leaves till you come  don't hurt it said diamond  north wind broke out in a little laugh like the breaking of silver bubbles and was gone in a moment diamond saw for it was a starlit night and the mass of hay was at a low ebb now the gleam of something vanishing down the stair and springing out of bed dressed himself as fast as ever he could then he crept out into the yard through the door in the wall and away to the primrose behind it stood north wind leaning over it and looking at the flower as if she had been its mother  come along she said jumping up and holding out her hand  diamond took her hand it was cold but so pleasant and full of life it was better than warm she led him across the garden with one bound she was on the top of the wall diamond was left at the foot  stop stop he cried please i can't jump like that  you don't try said north wind who from the top looked down a foot taller than before  give me your hand again and i will try said diamond  she reached down diamond laid hold of her hand gave a great spring and stood beside her  this is nice he said  another bound and they stood in the road by the river it was full tide and the stars were shining clear in its depths for it lay still waiting for the turn to run down again to the sea they walked along its side but they had not walked far before its surface was covered with ripples and the stars had vanished from its bosom  and north wind was now tall as a full-grown girl her hair was flying about her head and the wind was blowing a breeze down the river but she turned aside and went up a narrow lane and as she went her hair fell down around her  i have some rather disagreeable work to do to-night she said before i get out to sea and i must set about it at once the disagreeable work must be looked after first  so saying she laid hold of diamond and began to run gliding along faster and faster diamond kept up with her as well as he could she made many turnings and windings apparently because it was not quite easy to get him over walls and houses once they ran through a hall where they found back and front doors open at the foot of the stair north wind stood still and diamond hearing a great growl started in terror and there instead of north wind was a huge wolf by his side he let go his hold in dismay and the wolf bounded up the stair the windows of the house rattled and shook as if guns were firing and the sound of a great fall came from above diamond stood with white face staring up at the landing  surely he thought north wind can't be eating one of the children  coming to himself all at once he rushed after her with his little fist clenched there were ladies in long trains going up and down the stairs and gentlemen in white neckties attending on them who stared at him but none of them were of the people of the house and they said nothing before he reached the head of the stair however north wind met him took him by the hand and hurried down and out of the house  i hope you haven't eaten a baby north wind said diamond very solemnly  north wind laughed merrily and went tripping on faster her grassy robe swept and swirled about her steps and wherever it passed over withered leaves they went fleeing and whirling in spirals and running on their edges like wheels all about her feet  no she said at last i did not eat a baby you would not have had to ask that foolish question if you had not let go your hold of me you would have seen how i served a nurse that was calling a child bad names and telling her she was wicked she had been drinking i saw an ugly gin bottle in a cupboard  and you frightened her said diamond  i believe so answered north wind laughing merrily i flew at her throat and she tumbled over on the floor with such a crash that they ran in she'll be turned away to-morrow and quite time if they knew as much as i do  but didn't you frighten the little one  she never saw me the woman would not have seen me either if she had not been wicked  oh said diamond dubiously  why should you see things returned north wind that you wouldn't understand or know what to do with good people see good things bad people bad things  then are you a bad thing  no for you see me diamond dear said the girl and she looked down at him and diamond saw the loving eyes of the great lady beaming from the depths of her falling hair  i had to make myself look like a bad thing before she could see me if i had put on any other shape than a wolf's she would not have seen me for that is what is growing to be her own shape inside of her  i don't know what you mean said diamond but i suppose it's all right  they were now climbing the slope of a grassy ascent it was primrose hill in fact although diamond had never heard of it the moment they reached the top north wind stood and turned her face towards london the stars were still shining clear and cold overhead there was not a cloud to be seen the air was sharp but diamond did not find it cold  now said the lady whatever you do do not let my hand go i might have lost you the last time only i was not in a hurry then  now i am in a hurry  yet she stood still for a moment     chapter iv north wind   and as she stood looking towards london diamond saw that she was trembling  are you cold north wind he asked  no diamond she answered looking down upon him with a smile i am only getting ready to sweep one of my rooms those careless greedy untidy children make it in such a mess  as she spoke he could have told by her voice if he had not seen with his eyes that she was growing larger and larger her head went up and up towards the stars and as she grew still trembling through all her body her hair also grew longer and longer and lifted itself from her head and went out in black waves the next moment however it fell back around her and she grew less and less till she was only a tall woman then she put her hands behind her head and gathered some of her hair and began weaving and knotting it together when she had done she bent down her beautiful face close to his and said   diamond i am afraid you would not keep hold of me and if i were to drop you i don't know what might happen so i have been making a place for you in my hair come  diamond held out his arms for with that grand face looking at him he believed like a baby she took him in her hands threw him over her shoulder and said get in diamond  and diamond parted her hair with his hands crept between and feeling about soon found the woven nest it was just like a pocket or like the shawl in which gipsy women carry their children north wind put her hands to her back felt all about the nest and finding it safe said   are you comfortable diamond  yes indeed answered diamond  the next moment he was rising in the air north wind grew towering up to the place of the clouds her hair went streaming out from her till it spread like a mist over the stars she flung herself abroad in space  diamond held on by two of the twisted ropes which parted and interwoven formed his shelter for he could not help being a little afraid as soon as he had come to himself he peeped through the woven meshes for he did not dare to look over the top of the nest the earth was rushing past like a river or a sea below him trees and water and green grass hurried away beneath a great roar of wild animals rose as they rushed over the zoological gardens mixed with a chattering of monkeys and a screaming of birds but it died away in a moment behind them and now there was nothing but the roofs of houses sweeping along like a great torrent of stones and rocks chimney-pots fell and tiles flew from the roofs but it looked to him as if they were left behind by the roofs and the chimneys as they scudded away there was a great roaring for the wind was dashing against london like a sea but at north wind's back diamond of course felt nothing of it all he was in a perfect calm he could hear the sound of it that was all  by and by he raised himself and looked over the edge of his nest there were the houses rushing up and shooting away below him like a fierce torrent of rocks instead of water then he looked up to the sky but could see no stars they were hidden by the blinding masses of the lady's hair which swept between he began to wonder whether she would hear him if he spoke he would try  please north wind he said what is that noise  from high over his head came the voice of north wind answering him gently   the noise of my besom i am the old woman that sweeps the cobwebs from the sky only i'm busy with the floor now  what makes the houses look as if they were running away  i am sweeping so fast over them  but please north wind i knew london was very big but i didn't know it was so big as this it seems as if we should never get away from it  we are going round and round else we should have left it long ago  is this the way you sweep north wind  yes i go round and round with my great besom  please would you mind going a little slower for i want to see the streets  you won't see much now  why  because i have nearly swept all the people home  oh i forgot said diamond and was quiet after that for he did not want to be troublesome  but she dropped a little towards the roofs of the houses and diamond could see down into the streets there were very few people about though the lamps flickered and flared again but nobody seemed to want them  suddenly diamond espied a little girl coming along a street she was dreadfully blown by the wind and a broom she was trailing behind her was very troublesome it seemed as if the wind had a spite at her it kept worrying her like a wild beast and tearing at her rags she was so lonely there  oh please north wind he cried won't you help that little girl  no diamond i mustn't leave my work  but why shouldn't you be kind to her  i am kind to her i am sweeping the wicked smells away  but you're kinder to me dear north wind why shouldn't you be as kind to her as you are to me  there are reasons diamond everybody can't be done to all the same everybody is not ready for the same thing  but i don't see why i should be kinder used than she  do you think nothing's to be done but what you can see diamond you silly it's all right of course you can help her if you like you've got nothing particular to do at this moment i have  oh do let me help her then but you won't be able to wait perhaps  no i can't wait you must do it yourself and mind the wind will get a hold of you too  don't you want me to help her north wind  not without having some idea what will happen if you break down and cry that won't be much of a help to her and it will make a goose of little diamond  i want to go said diamond only there's just one thing how am i to get home  if you're anxious about that perhaps you had better go with me i am bound to take you home again if you do  there cried diamond who was still looking after the little girl i'm sure the wind will blow her over and perhaps kill her do let me go  they had been sweeping more slowly along the line of the street there was a lull in the roaring  well though i cannot promise to take you home said north wind as she sank nearer and nearer to the tops of the houses i can promise you it will be all right in the end you will get home somehow have you made up your mind what to do  yes to help the little girl said diamond firmly  the same moment north wind dropt into the street and stood only a tall lady but with her hair flying up over the housetops she put her hands to her back took diamond and set him down in the street the same moment he was caught in the fierce coils of the blast and all but blown away north wind stepped back a step and at once towered in stature to the height of the houses a chimney-pot clashed at diamond's feet he turned in terror but it was to look for the little girl and when he turned again the lady had vanished and the wind was roaring along the street as if it had been the bed of an invisible torrent the little girl was scudding before the blast her hair flying too and behind her she dragged her broom her little legs were going as fast as ever they could to keep her from falling diamond crept into the shelter of a doorway thinking to stop her but she passed him like a bird crying gently and pitifully  stop stop little girl shouted diamond starting in pursuit  i can't wailed the girl the wind won't leave go of me  diamond could run faster than she and he had no broom in a few moments he had caught her by the frock but it tore in his hand and away went the little girl so he had to run again and this time he ran so fast that he got before her and turning round caught her in his arms when down they went both together which made the little girl laugh in the midst of her crying  where are you going asked diamond rubbing the elbow that had stuck farthest out the arm it belonged to was twined round a lamp-post as he stood between the little girl and the wind  home she said gasping for breath  then i will go with you said diamond  and then they were silent for a while for the wind blew worse than ever and they had both to hold on to the lamp-post  where is your crossing asked the girl at length  i don't sweep answered diamond  what do you do then asked she you ain't big enough for most things  i don't know what i do do answered he feeling rather ashamed nothing i suppose my father's mr coleman's coachman  have you a father she said staring at him as if a boy with a father was a natural curiosity  yes haven't you returned diamond  no nor mother neither old sal's all i've got and she began to cry again  i wouldn't go to her if she wasn't good to me said diamond  but you must go somewheres  move on said the voice of a policeman behind them  i told you so said the girl you must go somewheres they're always at it  but old sal doesn't beat you does she  i wish she would  what do you mean asked diamond quite bewildered  she would if she was my mother but she wouldn't lie abed a-cuddlin' of her ugly old bones and laugh to hear me crying at the door  you don't mean she won't let you in to-night  it'll be a good chance if she does  why are you out so late then asked diamond  my crossing's a long way off at the west end and i had been indulgin' in door-steps and mewses  we'd better have a try anyhow said diamond come along  as he spoke diamond thought he caught a glimpse of north wind turning a corner in front of them and when they turned the corner too they found it quiet there but he saw nothing of the lady  now you lead me he said taking her hand and i'll take care of you  the girl withdrew her hand but only to dry her eyes with her frock for the other had enough to do with her broom she put it in his again and led him turning after turning until they stopped at a cellar-door in a very dirty lane there she knocked  i shouldn't like to live here said diamond  oh yes you would if you had nowhere else to go to answered the girl i only wish we may get in  i don't want to go in said diamond  where do you mean to go then  home to my home  where's that  i don't exactly know  then you're worse off than i am  oh no for north wind  began diamond and stopped he hardly knew why  what said the girl as she held her ear to the door listening  but diamond did not reply neither did old sal  i told you so said the girl she is wide awake hearkening but we don't get in  what will you do then asked diamond  move on she answered  where  oh anywheres bless you i'm used to it  hadn't you better come home with me then  that's a good joke when you don't know where it is come on  but where  oh nowheres in particular come on  diamond obeyed the wind had now fallen considerably they wandered on and on turning in this direction and that without any reason for one way more than another until they had got out of the thick of the houses into a waste kind of place by this time they were both very tired diamond felt a good deal inclined to cry and thought he had been very silly to get down from the back of north wind not that he would have minded it if he had done the girl any good but he thought he had been of no use to her he was mistaken there for she was far happier for having diamond with her than if she had been wandering about alone she did not seem so tired as he was  do let us rest a bit said diamond  let's see she answered there's something like a railway there perhaps there's an open arch  they went towards it and found one and better still there was an empty barrel lying under the arch  hallo here we are said the girl a barrel's the jolliest bed going on the tramp i mean we'll have forty winks and then go on again  she crept in and diamond crept in beside her they put their arms round each other and when he began to grow warm diamond's courage began to come back  this is jolly he said i'm so glad  i don't think so much of it said the girl i'm used to it i suppose but i can't think how a kid like you comes to be out all alone this time o' night  she called him a kid but she was not really a month older than he was only she had had to work for her bread and that so soon makes people older  but i shouldn't have been out so late if i hadn't got down to help you said diamond north wind is gone home long ago  i think you must ha' got out o' one o' them hidget asylms said the girl you said something about the north wind afore that i couldn't get the rights of  so now for the sake of his character diamond had to tell her the whole story  she did not believe a word of it she said he wasn't such a flat as to believe all that bosh but as she spoke there came a great blast of wind through the arch and set the barrel rolling so they made haste to get out of it for they had no notion of being rolled over and over as if they had been packed tight and wouldn't hurt like a barrel of herrings  i thought we should have had a sleep said diamond but i can't say i'm very sleepy after all come let's go on again  they wandered on and on sometimes sitting on a door-step but always turning into lanes or fields when they had a chance  they found themselves at last on a rising ground that sloped rather steeply on the other side it was a waste kind of spot below bounded by an irregular wall with a few doors in it outside lay broken things in general from garden rollers to flower-pots and wine-bottles but the moment they reached the brow of the rising ground a gust of wind seized them and blew them down hill as fast as they could run nor could diamond stop before he went bang against one of the doors in the wall to his dismay it burst open when they came to themselves they peeped in it was the back door of a garden  ah ah cried diamond after staring for a few moments i thought so north wind takes nobody in here i am in master's garden i tell you what little girl you just bore a hole in old sal's wall and put your mouth to it and say 'please north wind mayn't i go out with you' and then you'll see what'll come  i daresay i shall but i'm out in the wind too often already to want more of it  i said with the north wind not in it  it's all one  it's not all one  it is all one  but i know best  and i know better i'll box your ears said the girl  diamond got very angry but he remembered that even if she did box his ears he musn't box hers again for she was a girl and all that boys must do if girls are rude is to go away and leave them so he went in at the door  good-bye mister said the girl  this brought diamond to his senses  i'm sorry i was cross he said come in and my mother will give you some breakfast  no thank you i must be off to my crossing it's morning now  i'm very sorry for you said diamond  well it is a life to be tired of what with old sal and so many holes in my shoes  i wonder you're so good i should kill myself  oh no you wouldn't when i think of it i always want to see what's coming next and so i always wait till next is over well i suppose there's somebody happy somewheres but it ain't in them carriages oh my how they do look sometimes fit to bite your head off good-bye  she ran up the hill and disappeared behind it then diamond shut the door as he best could and ran through the kitchen-garden to the stable and wasn't he glad to get into his own blessed bed again     chapter v the summer-house   diamond said nothing to his mother about his adventures he had half a notion that north wind was a friend of his mother and that if she did not know all about it at least she did not mind his going anywhere with the lady of the wind at the same time he doubted whether he might not appear to be telling stories if he told all especially as he could hardly believe it himself when he thought about it in the middle of the day although when the twilight was once half-way on to night he had no doubt about it at least for the first few days after he had been with her the girl that swept the crossing had certainly refused to believe him besides he felt sure that north wind would tell him if he ought to speak  it was some time before he saw the lady of the wind again indeed nothing remarkable took place in diamond's history until the following week this was what happened then diamond the horse wanted new shoes and diamond's father took him out of the stable and was just getting on his back to ride him to the forge when he saw his little boy standing by the pump and looking at him wistfully then the coachman took his foot out of the stirrup left his hold of the mane and bridle came across to his boy lifted him up and setting him on the horse's back told him to sit up like a man he then led away both diamonds together  the boy atop felt not a little tremulous as the great muscles that lifted the legs of the horse knotted and relaxed against his legs and he cowered towards the withers grasping with his hands the bit of mane worn short by the collar but when his father looked back at him saying once more sit up diamond he let the mane go and sat up notwithstanding that the horse thinking i suppose that his master had said to him come up diamond stepped out faster for both the diamonds were just grandly obedient and diamond soon found that as he was obedient to his father so the horse was obedient to him for he had not ridden far before he found courage to reach forward and catch hold of the bridle and when his father whose hand was upon it felt the boy pull it towards him he looked up and smiled and well pleased let go his hold and left diamond to guide diamond and the boy soon found that he could do so perfectly it was a grand thing to be able to guide a great beast like that and another discovery he made was that in order to guide the horse he had in a measure to obey the horse first if he did not yield his body to the motions of the horse's body he could not guide him he must fall off  the blacksmith lived at some distance deeper into london as they crossed the angle of a square diamond who was now quite comfortable on his living throne was glancing this way and that in a gentle pride when he saw a girl sweeping a crossing scuddingly before a lady the lady was his father's mistress mrs coleman and the little girl was she for whose sake he had got off north wind's back he drew diamond's bridle in eager anxiety to see whether her outstretched hand would gather a penny from mrs coleman but she had given one at the last crossing and the hand returned only to grasp its broom diamond could not bear it he had a penny in his pocket a gift of the same lady the day before and he tumbled off his horse to give it to the girl he tumbled off i say for he did tumble when he reached the ground but he got up in an instant and ran searching his pocket as he ran she made him a pretty courtesy when he offered his treasure but with a bewildered stare she thought first  then he was on the back of the north wind after all but looking up at the sound of the horse's feet on the paved crossing she changed her idea saying to herself north wind is his father's horse that's the secret of it why couldn't he say so and she had a mind to refuse the penny but his smile put it all right and she not only took his penny but put it in her mouth with a thank you mister did they wollop you then  oh no answered diamond they never wollops me  lor said the little girl and was speechless  meantime his father looking up and seeing the horse's back bare suffered a pang of awful dread but the next moment catching sight of him took him up and put him on saying   don't get off again diamond the horse might have put his foot on you  no father answered the boy and rode on in majestic safety  the summer drew near warm and splendid miss coleman was a little better in health and sat a good deal in the garden one day she saw diamond peeping through the shrubbery and called him he talked to her so frankly that she often sent for him after that and by degrees it came about that he had leave to run in the garden as he pleased he never touched any of the flowers or blossoms for he was not like some boys who cannot enjoy a thing without pulling it to pieces and so preventing every one from enjoying it after them  a week even makes such a long time in a child's life that diamond had begun once more to feel as if north wind were a dream of some far-off year  one hot evening he had been sitting with the young mistress as they called her in a little summer-house at the bottom of the lawn a wonderful thing for beauty the boy thought for a little window in the side of it was made of coloured glass it grew dusky and the lady began to feel chill and went in leaving the boy in the summer-house he sat there gazing out at a bed of tulips which although they had closed for the night could not go quite asleep for the wind that kept waving them about all at once he saw a great bumble-bee fly out of one of the tulips  there that is something done said a voice a gentle merry childish voice but so tiny at last it was i thought he would have had to stay there all night poor fellow i did  diamond could not tell whether the voice was near or far away it was so small and yet so clear he had never seen a fairy but he had heard of such and he began to look all about for one and there was the tiniest creature sliding down the stem of the tulip  are you the fairy that herds the bees he asked going out of the summer-house and down on his knees on the green shore of the tulip-bed  i'm not a fairy answered the little creature  how do you know that  it would become you better to ask how you are to know it  you've just told me  yes but what's the use of knowing a thing only because you're told it  well how am i to know you are not a fairy you do look very like one  in the first place fairies are much bigger than you see me  oh said diamond reflectively i thought they were very little  but they might be tremendously bigger than i am and yet not very big why i could be six times the size i am and not be very huge besides a fairy can't grow big and little at will though the nursery-tales do say so  they don't know better you stupid diamond have you never seen me before  and as she spoke a moan of wind bent the tulips almost to the ground and the creature laid her hand on diamond's shoulder in a moment he knew that it was north wind  i am very stupid he said but i never saw you so small before not even when you were nursing the primrose  must you see me every size that can be measured before you know me diamond  but how could i think it was you taking care of a great stupid bumble-bee  the more stupid he was the more need he had to be taken care of what with sucking honey and trying to open the door he was nearly dated and when it opened in the morning to let the sun see the tulip's heart what would the sun have thought to find such a stupid thing lying there with wings too  but how do you have time to look after bees  i don't look after bees i had this one to look after it was hard work though  hard work why you could blow a chimney down or or a boy's cap off  said diamond  both are easier than to blow a tulip open but i scarcely know the difference between hard and easy i am always able for what i have to do when i see my work i just rush at it and it is done but i mustn't chatter i have got to sink a ship to-night  sink a ship what with men in it  yes and women too  how dreadful i wish you wouldn't talk so  it is rather dreadful but it is my work i must do it  i hope you won't ask me to go with you  no i won't ask you but you must come for all that  i won't then  won't you and north wind grew a tall lady and looked him in the eyes and diamond said   please take me you cannot be cruel  no i could not be cruel if i would i can do nothing cruel although i often do what looks like cruel to those who do not know what i really am doing the people they say i drown i only carry away to to to well the back of the north wind that is what they used to call it long ago only i never saw the place  how can you carry them there if you never saw it  i know the way  but how is it you never saw it  because it is behind me  but you can look round  not far enough to see my own back no i always look before me in fact i grow quite blind and deaf when i try to see my back i only mind my work  but how does it be your work  ah that i can't tell you i only know it is because when i do it i feel all right and when i don't i feel all wrong east wind says only one does not exactly know how much to believe of what she says for she is very naughty sometimes she says it is all managed by a baby but whether she is good or naughty when she says that i don't know i just stick to my work it is all one to me to let a bee out of a tulip or to sweep the cobwebs from the sky you would like to go with me to-night  i don't want to see a ship sunk  but suppose i had to take you  why then of course i must go  there's a good diamond i think i had better be growing a bit only you must go to bed first i can't take you till you're in bed that's the law about the children so i had better go and do something else first  very well north wind said diamond what are you going to do first if you please  i think i may tell you jump up on the top of the wall there  i can't  ah and i can't help you you haven't been to bed yet you see come out to the road with me just in front of the coach-house and i will show you  north wind grew very small indeed so small that she could not have blown the dust off a dusty miller as the scotch children call a yellow auricula diamond could not even see the blades of grass move as she flitted along by his foot they left the lawn went out by the wicket in the-coach-house gates and then crossed the road to the low wall that separated it from the river  you can get up on this wall diamond said north wind  yes but my mother has forbidden me  then don't said north wind  but i can see over said diamond  ah to be sure i can't  so saying north wind gave a little bound and stood on the top of the wall she was just about the height a dragon-fly would be if it stood on end  you darling said diamond seeing what a lovely little toy-woman she was  don't be impertinent master diamond said north wind if there's one thing makes me more angry than another it is the way you humans judge things by their size i am quite as respectable now as i shall be six hours after this when i take an east indiaman by the royals twist her round and push her under you have no right to address me in such a fashion  but as she spoke the tiny face wore the smile of a great grand woman she was only having her own beautiful fun out of diamond and true woman's fun never hurts  but look there she resumed do you see a boat with one man in it a green and white boat  yes quite well  that's a poet  i thought you said it was a bo-at  stupid pet don't you know what a poet is  why a thing to sail on the water in  well perhaps you're not so far wrong some poets do carry people over the sea but i have no business to talk so much the man is a poet  the boat is a boat said diamond  can't you spell asked north wind  not very well  so i see a poet is not a bo-at as you call it a poet is a man who is glad of something and tries to make other people glad of it too  ah now i know like the man in the sweety-shop  not very but i see it is no use i wasn't sent to tell you and so i can't tell you i must be off only first just look at the man  he's not much of a rower said diamond paddling first with one fin and then with the other  now look here said north wind  and she flashed like a dragon-fly across the water whose surface rippled and puckered as she passed the next moment the man in the boat glanced about him and bent to his oars the boat flew over the rippling water man and boat and river were awake the same instant almost north wind perched again upon the river wall  how did you do that asked diamond  i blew in his face answered north wind i don't see how that could do it said diamond i daresay not and therefore you will say you don't believe it could  no no dear north wind i know you too well not to believe you  well i blew in his face and that woke him up  but what was the good of it  why don't you see look at him how he is pulling i blew the mist out of him  how was that  that is just what i cannot tell you  but you did it  yes i have to do ten thousand things without being able to tell how  i don't like that said diamond  he was staring after the boat hearing no answer he looked down to the wall  north wind was gone away across the river went a long ripple what sailors call a cat's paw the man in the boat was putting up a sail the moon was coming to herself on the edge of a great cloud and the sail began to shine white diamond rubbed his eyes and wondered what it was all about things seemed going on around him and all to understand each other but he could make nothing of it so he put his hands in his pockets and went in to have his tea the night was very hot for the wind had fallen again  you don't seem very well to-night diamond said his mother  i am quite well mother returned diamond who was only puzzled  i think you had better go to bed she added  very well mother he answered  he stopped for one moment to look out of the window above the moon the clouds were going different ways somehow or other this troubled him but notwithstanding he was soon fast asleep  he woke in the middle of the night and the darkness a terrible noise was rumbling overhead like the rolling beat of great drums echoing through a brazen vault the roof of the loft in which he lay had no ceiling only the tiles were between him and the sky for a while he could not come quite awake for the noise kept beating him down so that his heart was troubled and fluttered painfully a second peal of thunder burst over his head and almost choked him with fear nor did he recover until the great blast that followed having torn some tiles off the roof sent a spout of wind down into his bed and over his face which brought him wide awake and gave him back his courage the same moment he heard a mighty yet musical voice calling him  come up diamond it said it's all ready i'm waiting for you  he looked out of the bed and saw a gigantic powerful but most lovely arm with a hand whose fingers were nothing the less ladylike that they could have strangled a boa-constrictor or choked a tigress off its prey stretched down through a big hole in the roof without a moment's hesitation he reached out his tiny one and laid it in the grand palm before him     chapter vi out in the storm   the hand felt its way up his arm and grasping it gently and strongly above the elbow lifted diamond from the bed the moment he was through the hole in the roof all the winds of heaven seemed to lay hold upon him and buffet him hither and thither his hair blew one way his night-gown another his legs threatened to float from under him and his head to grow dizzy with the swiftness of the invisible assailant cowering he clung with the other hand to the huge hand which held his arm and fear invaded his heart  oh north wind he murmured but the words vanished from his lips as he had seen the soap-bubbles that burst too soon vanish from the mouth of his pipe the wind caught them and they were nowhere they couldn't get out at all but were torn away and strangled and yet north wind heard them and in her answer it seemed to diamond that just because she was so big and could not help it and just because her ear and her mouth must seem to him so dreadfully far away she spoke to him more tenderly and graciously than ever before her voice was like the bass of a deep organ without the groan in it like the most delicate of violin tones without the wail in it like the most glorious of trumpet-ejaculations without the defiance in it like the sound of falling water without the clatter and clash in it  it was like all of them and neither of them all of them without their faults each of them without its peculiarity  after all it was more like his mother's voice than anything else in the world  diamond dear she said be a man what is fearful to you is not the least fearful to me  but it can't hurt you murmured diamond for you're it  then if i'm it and have you in my arms how can it hurt you  oh yes i see whispered diamond but it looks so dreadful and it pushes me about so  yes it does my dear that is what it was sent for  at the same moment a peal of thunder which shook diamond's heart against the sides of his bosom hurtled out of the heavens  i cannot say out of the sky for there was no sky diamond had not seen the lightning for he had been intent on finding the face of north wind every moment the folds of her garment would sweep across his eyes and blind him but between he could just persuade himself that he saw great glories of woman's eyes looking down through rifts in the mountainous clouds over his head  he trembled so at the thunder that his knees failed him and he sunk down at north wind's feet and clasped her round the column of her ankle she instantly stooped lifted him from the roof up up into her bosom and held him there saying as if to an inconsolable child   diamond dear this will never do  oh yes it will answered diamond i am all right now quite comfortable i assure you dear north wind if you will only let me stay here i shall be all right indeed  but you will feel the wind here diamond  i don't mind that a bit so long as i feel your arms through it  answered diamond nestling closer to her grand bosom  brave boy returned north wind pressing him closer  no said diamond i don't see that it's not courage at all so long as i feel you there  but hadn't you better get into my hair then you would not feel the wind you will here  ah but dear north wind you don't know how nice it is to feel your arms about me it is a thousand times better to have them and the wind together than to have only your hair and the back of your neck and no wind at all  but it is surely more comfortable there  well perhaps but i begin to think there are better things than being comfortable  yes indeed there are well i will keep you in front of me you will feel the wind but not too much i shall only want one arm to take care of you the other will be quite enough to sink the ship  oh dear north wind how can you talk so  my dear boy i never talk i always mean what i say  then you do mean to sink the ship with the other hand  yes  it's not like you  how do you know that  quite easily here you are taking care of a poor little boy with one arm and there you are sinking a ship with the other it can't be like you  ah but which is me i can't be two mes you know  no nobody can be two mes  well which me is me  now i must think there looks to be two  yes that's the very point you can't be knowing the thing you don't know can you  no  which me do you know  the kindest goodest best me in the world answered diamond clinging to north wind  why am i good to you  i don't know  have you ever done anything for me  no  then i must be good to you because i choose to be good to you  yes  why should i choose  because because because you like  why should i like to be good to you  i don't know except it be because it's good to be good to me  that's just it i am good to you because i like to be good  then why shouldn't you be good to other people as well as to me  that's just what i don't know why shouldn't i  i don't know either then why shouldn't you  because i am  there it is again said diamond i don't see that you are it looks quite the other thing  well but listen to me diamond you know the one me you say and that is good  yes  do you know the other me as well  no i can't i shouldn't like to  there it is you don't know the other me you are sure of one of them  yes  and you are sure there can't be two mes  yes  then the me you don't know must be the same as the me you do know else there would be two mes  yes  then the other me you don't know must be as kind as the me you do know  yes  besides i tell you that it is so only it doesn't look like it that i confess freely have you anything more to object  no no dear north wind i am quite satisfied  then i will tell you something you might object you might say that the me you know is like the other me and that i am cruel all through  i know that can't be because you are so kind  but that kindness might be only a pretence for the sake of being more cruel afterwards  diamond clung to her tighter than ever crying   no no dear north wind i can't believe that i don't believe it i won't believe it that would kill me i love you and you must love me else how did i come to love you how could you know how to put on such a beautiful face if you did not love me and the rest no you may sink as many ships as you like and i won't say another word i can't say i shall like to see it you know  that's quite another thing said north wind and as she spoke she gave one spring from the roof of the hay-loft and rushed up into the clouds with diamond on her left arm close to her heart and as if the clouds knew she had come they burst into a fresh jubilation of thunderous light for a few moments diamond seemed to be borne up through the depths of an ocean of dazzling flame the next the winds were writhing around him like a storm of serpents for they were in the midst of the clouds and mists and they of course took the shapes of the wind eddying and wreathing and whirling and shooting and dashing about like grey and black water so that it was as if the wind itself had taken shape and he saw the grey and black wind tossing and raving most madly all about him now it blinded him by smiting him upon the eyes now it deafened him by bellowing in his ears for even when the thunder came he knew now that it was the billows of the great ocean of the air dashing against each other in their haste to fill the hollow scooped out by the lightning now it took his breath quite away by sucking it from his body with the speed of its rush but he did not mind it he only gasped first and then laughed for the arm of north wind was about him and he was leaning against her bosom it is quite impossible for me to describe what he saw did you ever watch a great wave shoot into a winding passage amongst rocks if you ever did you would see that the water rushed every way at once some of it even turning back and opposing the rest greater confusion you might see nowhere except in a crowd of frightened people well the wind was like that except that it went much faster and therefore was much wilder and twisted and shot and curled and dodged and clashed and raved ten times more madly than anything else in creation except human passions diamond saw the threads of the lady's hair streaking it all in parts indeed he could not tell which was hair and which was black storm and vapour it seemed sometimes that all the great billows of mist-muddy wind were woven out of the crossing lines of north wind's infinite hair sweeping in endless intertwistings and diamond felt as the wind seized on his hair which his mother kept rather long as if he too was a part of the storm and some of its life went out from him but so sheltered was he by north wind's arm and bosom that only at times in the fiercer onslaught of some curl-billowed eddy did he recognise for a moment how wild was the storm in which he was carried nestling in its very core and formative centre  it seemed to diamond likewise that they were motionless in this centre and that all the confusion and fighting went on around them flash after flash illuminated the fierce chaos revealing in varied yellow and blue and grey and dusky red the vapourous contention peal after peal of thunder tore the infinite waste but it seemed to diamond that north wind and he were motionless all but the hair it was not so they were sweeping with the speed of the wind itself towards the sea     chapter vii the cathedral   i must not go on describing what cannot be described for nothing is more wearisome  before they reached the sea diamond felt north wind's hair just beginning to fall about him  is the storm over north wind he called out  no diamond i am only waiting a moment to set you down you would not like to see the ship sunk and i am going to give you a place to stop in till i come back for you  oh thank you said diamond i shall be sorry to leave you north wind but i would rather not see the ship go down and i'm afraid the poor people will cry and i should hear them oh dear  there are a good many passengers on board and to tell the truth diamond i don't care about your hearing the cry you speak of i am afraid you would not get it out of your little head again for a long time  but how can you bear it then north wind for i am sure you are kind i shall never doubt that again  i will tell you how i am able to bear it diamond  i am always hearing through every noise through all the noise i am making myself even the sound of a far-off song i do not exactly know where it is or what it means and i don't hear much of it only the odour of its music as it were flitting across the great billows of the ocean outside this air in which i make such a storm but what i do hear is quite enough to make me able to bear the cry from the drowning ship so it would you if you could hear it  no it wouldn't returned diamond stoutly for they wouldn't hear the music of the far-away song and if they did it wouldn't do them any good you see you and i are not going to be drowned and so we might enjoy it  but you have never heard the psalm and you don't know what it is like somehow i can't say how it tells me that all is right that it is coming to swallow up all cries  but that won't do them any good the people i mean persisted diamond  it must it must said north wind hurriedly it wouldn't be the song it seems to be if it did not swallow up all their fear and pain too and set them singing it themselves with the rest i am sure it will and do you know ever since i knew i had hair that is ever since it began to go out and away that song has been coming nearer and nearer only i must say it was some thousand years before i heard it  but how can you say it was coming nearer when you did not hear it  asked doubting little diamond  since i began to hear it i know it is growing louder therefore i judge it was coming nearer and nearer until i did hear it first i'm not so very old you know a few thousand years only and i was quite a baby when i heard the noise first but i knew it must come from the voices of people ever so much older and wiser than i was i can't sing at all except now and then and i can never tell what my song is going to be i only know what it is after i have sung it but this will never do will you stop here  i can't see anywhere to stop said diamond your hair is all down like a darkness and i can't see through it if i knock my eyes into it ever so much  look then said north wind and with one sweep of her great white arm she swept yards deep of darkness like a great curtain from before the face of the boy  and lo it was a blue night lit up with stars where it did not shine with stars it shimmered with the milk of the stars except where just opposite to diamond's face the grey towers of a cathedral blotted out each its own shape of sky and stars  oh what's that cried diamond struck with a kind of terror for he had never seen a cathedral and it rose before him with an awful reality in the midst of the wide spaces conquering emptiness with grandeur  a very good place for you to wait in said north wind but we shall go in and you shall judge for yourself  there was an open door in the middle of one of the towers leading out upon the roof and through it they passed then north wind set diamond on his feet and he found himself at the top of a stone stair which went twisting away down into the darkness for only a little light came in at the door it was enough however to allow diamond to see that north wind stood beside him he looked up to find her face and saw that she was no longer a beautiful giantess but the tall gracious lady he liked best to see she took his hand and giving him the broad part of the spiral stair to walk on led him down a good way then opening another little door led him out upon a narrow gallery that ran all round the central part of the church on the ledges of the windows of the clerestory and through openings in the parts of the wall that divided the windows from each other it was very narrow and except when they were passing through the wall diamond saw nothing to keep him from falling into the church it lay below him like a great silent gulf hollowed in stone and he held his breath for fear as he looked down  what are you trembling for little diamond said the lady as she walked gently along with her hand held out behind her leading him for there was not breadth enough for them to walk side by side  i am afraid of falling down there answered diamond it is so deep down  yes rather answered north wind but you were a hundred times higher a few minutes ago  ah yes but somebody's arm was about me then said diamond putting his little mouth to the beautiful cold hand that had a hold of his  what a dear little warm mouth you've got said north wind it is a pity you should talk nonsense with it don't you know i have a hold of you  yes but i'm walking on my own legs and they might slip i can't trust myself so well as your arms  but i have a hold of you i tell you foolish child  yes but somehow i can't feel comfortable  if you were to fall and my hold of you were to give way i should be down after you in a less moment than a lady's watch can tick and catch you long before you had reached the ground  i don't like it though said diamond  oh oh oh he screamed the next moment bent double with terror for north wind had let go her hold of his hand and had vanished leaving him standing as if rooted to the gallery  she left the words come after me sounding in his ears  but move he dared not in a moment more he would from very terror have fallen into the church but suddenly there came a gentle breath of cool wind upon his face and it kept blowing upon him in little puffs and at every puff diamond felt his faintness going away and his fear with it courage was reviving in his little heart and still the cool wafts of the soft wind breathed upon him and the soft wind was so mighty and strong within its gentleness that in a minute more diamond was marching along the narrow ledge as fearless for the time as north wind herself  he walked on and on with the windows all in a row on one side of him and the great empty nave of the church echoing to every one of his brave strides on the other until at last he came to a little open door from which a broader stair led him down and down and down till at last all at once he found himself in the arms of north wind who held him close to her and kissed him on the forehead diamond nestled to her and murmured into her bosom why did you leave me dear north wind  because i wanted you to walk alone she answered  but it is so much nicer here said diamond  i daresay but i couldn't hold a little coward to my heart it would make me so cold  but i wasn't brave of myself said diamond whom my older readers will have already discovered to be a true child in this that he was given to metaphysics it was the wind that blew in my face that made me brave wasn't it now north wind  yes  i know that you had to be taught what courage was and you couldn't know what it was without feeling it  therefore it was given you but don't you feel as if you would try to be brave yourself next time  yes i do but trying is not much  yes it is a very great deal for it is a beginning and a beginning is the greatest thing of all to try to be brave is to be brave the coward who tries to be brave is before the man who is brave because he is made so and never had to try  how kind you are north wind  i am only just all kindness is but justice we owe it  i don't quite understand that  never mind you will some day there is no hurry about understanding it now  who blew the wind on me that made me brave  i did  i didn't see you  therefore you can believe me  yes yes of course but how was it that such a little breath could be so strong  that i don't know  but you made it strong  no  i only blew it i knew it would make you strong just as it did the man in the boat you remember but how my breath has that power i cannot tell it was put into it when i was made that is all i know but really i must be going about my work  ah the poor ship i wish you would stop here and let the poor ship go  that i dare not do will you stop here till i come back  yes you won't be long  not longer than i can help trust me you shall get home before the morning  in a moment north wind was gone and the next diamond heard a moaning about the church which grew and grew to a roaring the storm was up again and he knew that north wind's hair was flying  the church was dark only a little light came through the windows which were almost all of that precious old stained glass which is so much lovelier than the new but diamond could not see how beautiful they were for there was not enough of light in the stars to show the colours of them he could only just distinguish them from the walls he looked up but could not see the gallery along which he had passed he could only tell where it was far up by the faint glimmer of the windows of the clerestory whose sills made part of it the church grew very lonely about him and he began to feel like a child whose mother has forsaken it only he knew that to be left alone is not always to be forsaken  he began to feel his way about the place and for a while went wandering up and down his little footsteps waked little answering echoes in the great house it wasn't too big to mind him it was as if the church knew he was there and meant to make itself his house so it went on giving back an answer to every step until at length diamond thought he should like to say something out loud and see what the church would answer but he found he was afraid to speak he could not utter a word for fear of the loneliness perhaps it was as well that he did not for the sound of a spoken word would have made him feel the place yet more deserted and empty but he thought he could sing he was fond of singing and at home he used to sing to tunes of his own all the nursery rhymes he knew so he began to try `hey diddle diddle' but it wouldn't do then he tried `little boy blue' but it was no better neither would `sing a song of sixpence' sing itself at all then he tried `poor old cockytoo' but he wouldn't do they all sounded so silly and he had never thought them silly before so he was quiet and listened to the echoes that came out of the dark corners in answer to his footsteps  at last he gave a great sigh and said i'm so tired but he did not hear the gentle echo that answered from far away over his head for at the same moment he came against the lowest of a few steps that stretched across the church and fell down and hurt his arm he cried a little first and then crawled up the steps on his hands and knees at the top he came to a little bit of carpet on which he lay down and there he lay staring at the dull window that rose nearly a hundred feet above his head  now this was the eastern window of the church and the moon was at that moment just on the edge of the horizon the next she was peeping over it and lo with the moon st john and st paul and the rest of them began to dawn in the window in their lovely garments diamond did not know that the wonder-working moon was behind and he thought all the light was coming out of the window itself and that the good old men were appearing to help him growing out of the night and the darkness because he had hurt his arm and was very tired and lonely and north wind was so long in coming so he lay and looked at them backwards over his head wondering when they would come down or what they would do next they were very dim for the moonlight was not strong enough for the colours and he had enough to do with his eyes trying to make out their shapes so his eyes grew tired and more and more tired and his eyelids grew so heavy that they would keep tumbling down over his eyes he kept lifting them and lifting them but every time they were heavier than the last it was no use  they were too much for him sometimes before he had got them half up down they were again and at length he gave it up quite and the moment he gave it up he was fast asleep     chapter viii the east window   that diamond had fallen fast asleep is very evident from the strange things he now fancied as taking place for he thought he heard a sound as of whispering up in the great window he tried to open his eyes but he could not and the whispering went on and grew louder and louder until he could hear every word that was said he thought it was the apostles talking about him but he could not open his eyes  and how comes he to be lying there st peter said one  i think i saw him a while ago up in the gallery under the nicodemus window perhaps he has fallen down  what do you think st matthew  i don't think he could have crept here after falling from such a height he must have been killed  what are we to do with him we can't leave him lying there and we could not make him comfortable up here in the window  it's rather crowded already what do you say st thomas  let's go down and look at him  there came a rustling and a chinking for some time and then there was a silence and diamond felt somehow that all the apostles were standing round him and looking down on him and still he could not open his eyes  what is the matter with him st luke asked one  there's nothing the matter with him answered st luke who must have joined the company of the apostles from the next window one would think he's in a sound sleep  i have it cried another this is one of north wind's tricks she has caught him up and dropped him at our door like a withered leaf or a foundling baby i don't understand that woman's conduct i must say as if we hadn't enough to do with our money without going taking care of other people's children that's not what our forefathers built cathedrals for  now diamond could not bear to hear such things against north wind who he knew never played anybody a trick she was far too busy with her own work for that he struggled hard to open his eyes but without success  she should consider that a church is not a place for pranks not to mention that we live in it said another  it certainly is disrespectful of her but she always is disrespectful what right has she to bang at our windows as she has been doing the whole of this night i daresay there is glass broken somewhere i know my blue robe is in a dreadful mess with the rain first and the dust after it will cost me shillings to clean it  then diamond knew that they could not be apostles talking like this they could only be the sextons and vergers and such-like who got up at night and put on the robes of deans and bishops and called each other grand names as the foolish servants he had heard his father tell of call themselves lords and ladies after their masters and mistresses and he was so angry at their daring to abuse north wind that he jumped up crying north wind knows best what she is about she has a good right to blow the cobwebs from your windows for she was sent to do it she sweeps them away from grander places i can tell you for i've been with her at it  this was what he began to say but as he spoke his eyes came wide open and behold there were neither apostles nor vergers there not even a window with the effigies of holy men in it but a dark heap of hay all about him and the little panes in the roof of his loft glimmering blue in the light of the morning old diamond was coming awake down below in the stable in a moment more he was on his feet and shaking himself so that young diamond's bed trembled under him  he's grand at shaking himself said diamond i wish i could shake myself like that but then i can wash myself and he can't what fun it would be to see old diamond washing his face with his hoofs and iron shoes wouldn't it be a picture  so saying he got up and dressed himself then he went out into the garden there must have been a tremendous wind in the night for although all was quiet now there lay the little summer-house crushed to the ground and over it the great elm-tree which the wind had broken across being much decayed in the middle diamond almost cried to see the wilderness of green leaves which used to be so far up in the blue air tossing about in the breeze and liking it best when the wind blew it most now lying so near the ground and without any hope of ever getting up into the deep air again  i wonder how old the tree is thought diamond it must take a long time to get so near the sky as that poor tree was  yes indeed said a voice beside him for diamond had spoken the last words aloud  diamond started and looking around saw a clergyman a brother of mrs coleman who happened to be visiting her he was a great scholar and was in the habit of rising early  who are you my man he added  little diamond answered the boy  oh i have heard of you how do you come to be up so early  because the sham apostles talked such nonsense they waked me up  the clergyman stared diamond saw that he had better have held his tongue for he could not explain things  you must have been dreaming my little man said he dear dear he went on looking at the tree there has been terrible work here this is the north wind's doing what a pity i wish we lived at the back of it i'm sure  where is that sir asked diamond  away in the hyperborean regions answered the clergyman smiling  i never heard of the place returned diamond  i daresay not answered the clergyman but if this tree had been there now it would not have been blown down for there is no wind there  but please sir if it had been there said diamond we should not have had to be sorry for it  certainly not  then we shouldn't have had to be glad for it either  you're quite right my boy said the clergyman looking at him very kindly as he turned away to the house with his eyes bent towards the earth but diamond thought within himself i will ask north wind next time i see her to take me to that country i think she did speak about it once before     chapter ix how diamond got to the back of the north wind   when diamond went home to breakfast he found his father and mother already seated at the table they were both busy with their bread and butter and diamond sat himself down in his usual place his mother looked up at him and after watching him for a moment said   i don't think the boy is looking well husband  don't you well i don't know i think he looks pretty bobbish how do you feel yourself diamond my boy  quite well thank you father at least i think i've got a little headache  there i told you said his father and mother both at once  the child's very poorly added his mother  the child's quite well added his father  and then they both laughed  you see said his mother i've had a letter from my sister at sandwich  sleepy old hole said his father  don't abuse the place there's good people in it said his mother  right old lady returned his father only i don't believe there are more than two pair of carriage-horses in the whole blessed place  well people can get to heaven without carriages or coachmen either husband not that i should like to go without my coachman you know but about the boy  what boy  that boy there staring at you with his goggle-eyes  have i got goggle-eyes mother asked diamond a little dismayed  not too goggle said his mother who was quite proud of her boy's eyes only did not want to make him vain  not too goggle only you need not stare so  well what about him said his father  i told you i had got a letter  yes from your sister not from diamond  la husband you've got out of bed the wrong leg first this morning i do believe  i always get out with both at once said his father laughing  well listen then his aunt wants the boy to go down and see her  and that's why you want to make out that he ain't looking well  no more he is i think he had better go  well i don't care if you can find the money said his father  i'll manage that said his mother and so it was agreed that diamond should go to sandwich  i will not describe the preparations diamond made you would have thought he had been going on a three months' voyage nor will i describe the journey for our business is now at the place he was met at the station by his aunt a cheerful middle-aged woman and conveyed in safety to the sleepy old town as his father called it and no wonder that it was sleepy for it was nearly dead of old age  diamond went about staring with his beautiful goggle-eyes at the quaint old streets and the shops and the houses everything looked very strange indeed for here was a town abandoned by its nurse the sea like an old oyster left on the shore till it gaped for weariness it used to be one of the five chief seaports in england but it began to hold itself too high and the consequence was the sea grew less and less intimate with it gradually drew back and kept more to itself till at length it left it high and dry  sandwich was a seaport no more the sea went on with its own tide-business a long way off and forgot it of course it went to sleep and had no more to do with ships that's what comes to cities and nations and boys and girls who say i can do without your help i'm enough for myself  diamond soon made great friends with an old woman who kept a toyshop for his mother had given him twopence for pocket-money before he left and he had gone into her shop to spend it and she got talking to him she looked very funny because she had not got any teeth but diamond liked her and went often to her shop although he had nothing to spend there after the twopence was gone  one afternoon he had been wandering rather wearily about the streets for some time it was a hot day and he felt tired as he passed the toyshop he stepped in  please may i sit down for a minute on this box he said thinking the old woman was somewhere in the shop but he got no answer and sat down without one around him were a great many toys of all prices from a penny up to shillings all at once he heard a gentle whirring somewhere amongst them it made him start and look behind him there were the sails of a windmill going round and round almost close to his ear he thought at first it must be one of those toys which are wound up and go with clockwork but no it was a common penny toy with the windmill at the end of a whistle and when the whistle blows the windmill goes but the wonder was that there was no one at the whistle end blowing and yet the sails were turning round and round now faster now slower now faster again  what can it mean said diamond aloud  it means me said the tiniest voice he had ever heard  who are you please asked diamond  well really i begin to be ashamed of you said the voice i wonder how long it will be before you know me or how often i might take you in before you got sharp enough to suspect me you are as bad as a baby that doesn't know his mother in a new bonnet  not quite so bad as that dear north wind said diamond for i didn't see you at all and indeed i don't see you yet although i recognise your voice do grow a little please  not a hair's-breadth said the voice and it was the smallest voice that ever spoke what are you doing here  i am come to see my aunt but please north wind why didn't you come back for me in the church that night  i did i carried you safe home all the time you were dreaming about the glass apostles you were lying in my arms  i'm so glad said diamond i thought that must be it only i wanted to hear you say so did you sink the ship then  yes  and drown everybody  not quite one boat got away with six or seven men in it  how could the boat swim when the ship couldn't  of course i had some trouble with it i had to contrive a bit and manage the waves a little when they're once thoroughly waked up i have a good deal of trouble with them sometimes they're apt to get stupid with tumbling over each other's heads that's when they're fairly at it however the boat got to a desert island before noon next day  and what good will come of that  i don't know i obeyed orders good bye  oh stay north wind do stay cried diamond dismayed to see the windmill get slower and slower  what is it my dear child said north wind and the windmill began turning again so swiftly that diamond could scarcely see it what a big voice you've got and what a noise you do make with it what is it you want i have little to do but that little must be done  i want you to take me to the country at the back of the north wind  that's not so easy said north wind and was silent for so long that diamond thought she was gone indeed but after he had quite given her up the voice began again  i almost wish old herodotus had held his tongue about it much he knew of it  why do you wish that north wind  because then that clergyman would never have heard of it and set you wanting to go but we shall see we shall see you must go home now my dear for you don't seem very well and i'll see what can be done for you don't wait for me i've got to break a few of old goody's toys she's thinking too much of her new stock two or three will do there go now  diamond rose quite sorry and without a word left the shop and went home  it soon appeared that his mother had been right about him for that same afternoon his head began to ache very much and he had to go to bed  he awoke in the middle of the night the lattice window of his room had blown open and the curtains of his little bed were swinging about in the wind  if that should be north wind now thought diamond  but the next moment he heard some one closing the window and his aunt came to his bedside she put her hand on his face and said   how's your head dear  better auntie i think  would you like something to drink  oh yes i should please  so his aunt gave him some lemonade for she had been used to nursing sick people and diamond felt very much refreshed and laid his head down again to go very fast asleep as he thought and so he did but only to come awake again as a fresh burst of wind blew the lattice open a second time the same moment he found himself in a cloud of north wind's hair with her beautiful face set in it like a moon bending over him  quick diamond she said i have found such a chance  but i'm not well said diamond  i know that but you will be better for a little fresh air you shall have plenty of that  you want me to go then  yes i do it won't hurt you  very well said diamond and getting out of the bed-clothes he jumped into north wind's arms  we must make haste before your aunt comes said she as she glided out of the open lattice and left it swinging  the moment diamond felt her arms fold around him he began to feel better it was a moonless night and very dark with glimpses of stars when the clouds parted  i used to dash the waves about here said north wind where cows and sheep are feeding now but we shall soon get to them there they are  and diamond looking down saw the white glimmer of breaking water far below him  you see diamond said north wind it is very difficult for me to get you to the back of the north wind for that country lies in the very north itself and of course i can't blow northwards  why not asked diamond  you little silly said north wind don't you see that if i were to blow northwards i should be south wind and that is as much as to say that one person could be two persons  but how can you ever get home at all then  you are quite right that is my home though i never get farther than the outer door i sit on the doorstep and hear the voices inside i am nobody there diamond  i'm very sorry  why  that you should be nobody  oh i don't mind it dear little man you will be very glad some day to be nobody yourself but you can't understand that now and you had better not try for if you do you will be certain to go fancying some egregious nonsense and making yourself miserable about it  then i won't said diamond  there's a good boy it will all come in good time  but you haven't told me how you get to the doorstep you know  it is easy enough for me i have only to consent to be nobody and there i am i draw into myself and there i am on the doorstep but you can easily see or you have less sense than i think that to drag you you heavy thing along with me would take centuries and i could not give the time to it  oh i'm so sorry said diamond  what for now pet  that i'm so heavy for you i would be lighter if i could but i don't know how  you silly darling why i could toss you a hundred miles from me if i liked it is only when i am going home that i shall find you heavy  then you are going home with me  of course did i not come to fetch you just for that  but all this time you must be going southwards  yes of course i am  how can you be taking me northwards then  a very sensible question but you shall see i will get rid of a few of these clouds only they do come up so fast it's like trying to blow a brook dry there what do you see now  i think i see a little boat away there down below  a little boat indeed well she's a yacht of two hundred tons and the captain of it is a friend of mine for he is a man of good sense and can sail his craft well i've helped him many a time when he little thought it i've heard him grumbling at me when i was doing the very best i could for him why i've carried him eighty miles a day again and again right north  he must have dodged for that said diamond who had been watching the vessels and had seen that they went other ways than the wind blew  of course he must but don't you see it was the best i could do i couldn't be south wind and besides it gave him a share in the business it is not good at all mind that diamond to do everything for those you love and not give them a share in the doing it's not kind it's making too much of yourself my child if i had been south wind he would only have smoked his pipe all day and made himself stupid  but how could he be a man of sense and grumble at you when you were doing your best for him  oh you must make allowances said north wind or you will never do justice to anybody you do understand then that a captain may sail north    in spite of a north wind yes supplemented diamond  now i do think you must be stupid my dear said north wind suppose the north wind did not blow where would he be then  why then the south wind would carry him  so you think that when the north wind stops the south wind blows nonsense if i didn't blow the captain couldn't sail his eighty miles a day no doubt south wind would carry him faster but south wind is sitting on her doorstep then and if i stopped there would be a dead calm so you are all wrong to say he can sail north in spite of me he sails north by my help and my help alone you see that diamond  yes i do north wind i am stupid but i don't want to be stupid  good boy i am going to blow you north in that little craft one of the finest that ever sailed the sea here we are right over it i shall be blowing against you you will be sailing against me and all will be just as we want it the captain won't get on so fast as he would like but he will get on and so shall we i'm just going to put you on board do you see in front of the tiller that thing the man is working now to one side now to the other a round thing like the top of a drum  yes said diamond  below that is where they keep their spare sails and some stores of that sort i am going to blow that cover off the same moment i will drop you on deck and you must tumble in don't be afraid it is of no depth and you will fall on sail-cloth you will find it nice and warm and dry-only dark and you will know i am near you by every roll and pitch of the vessel coil yourself up and go to sleep the yacht shall be my cradle and you shall be my baby  thank you dear north wind i am not a bit afraid said diamond  in a moment they were on a level with the bulwarks and north wind sent the hatch of the after-store rattling away over the deck to leeward the next diamond found himself in the dark for he had tumbled through the hole as north wind had told him and the cover was replaced over his head away he went rolling to leeward for the wind began all at once to blow hard he heard the call of the captain and the loud trampling of the men over his head as they hauled at the main sheet to get the boom on board that they might take in a reef in the mainsail diamond felt about until he had found what seemed the most comfortable place and there he snuggled down and lay  hours after hours a great many of them went by and still diamond lay there he never felt in the least tired or impatient for a strange pleasure filled his heart the straining of the masts the creaking of the boom the singing of the ropes the banging of the blocks as they put the vessel about all fell in with the roaring of the wind above the surge of the waves past her sides and the thud with which every now and then one would strike her while through it all diamond could hear the gurgling rippling talking flow of the water against her planks as she slipped through it lying now on this side now on that like a subdued air running through the grand music his north wind was making about him to keep him from tiring as they sped on towards the country at the back of her doorstep  how long this lasted diamond had no idea he seemed to fall asleep sometimes only through the sleep he heard the sounds going on at length the weather seemed to get worse the confusion and trampling of feet grew more frequent over his head the vessel lay over more and more on her side and went roaring through the waves which banged and thumped at her as if in anger all at once arose a terrible uproar the hatch was blown off a cold fierce wind swept in upon him and a long arm came with it which laid hold of him and lifted him out the same moment he saw the little vessel far below him righting herself she had taken in all her sails and lay now tossing on the waves like a sea-bird with folded wings a short distance to the south lay a much larger vessel with two or three sails set and towards it north wind was carrying diamond it was a german ship on its way to the north pole  that vessel down there will give us a lift now said north wind and after that i must do the best i can  she managed to hide him amongst the flags of the big ship which were all snugly stowed away and on and on they sped towards the north at length one night she whispered in his ear come on deck diamond and he got up at once and crept on deck everything looked very strange here and there on all sides were huge masses of floating ice looking like cathedrals and castles and crags while away beyond was a blue sea  is the sun rising or setting asked diamond  neither or both which you please i can hardly tell which myself if he is setting now he will be rising the next moment  what a strange light it is said diamond i have heard that the sun doesn't go to bed all the summer in these parts miss coleman told me that i suppose he feels very sleepy and that is why the light he sends out looks so like a dream  that will account for it well enough for all practical purposes said north wind  some of the icebergs were drifting northwards one was passing very near the ship north wind seized diamond and with a single bound lighted on one of them a huge thing with sharp pinnacles and great clefts the same instant a wind began to blow from the south north wind hurried diamond down the north side of the iceberg stepping by its jags and splintering for this berg had never got far enough south to be melted and smoothed by the summer sun she brought him to a cave near the water where she entered and letting diamond go sat down as if weary on a ledge of ice  diamond seated himself on the other side and for a while was enraptured with the colour of the air inside the cave it was a deep dazzling lovely blue deeper than the deepest blue of the sky the blue seemed to be in constant motion like the blackness when you press your eyeballs with your fingers boiling and sparkling but when he looked across to north wind he was frightened her face was worn and livid  what is the matter with you dear north wind he said  nothing much i feel very faint but you mustn't mind it for i can bear it quite well south wind always blows me faint if it were not for the cool of the thick ice between me and her i should faint altogether indeed as it is i fear i must vanish  diamond stared at her in terror for he saw that her form and face were growing not small but transparent like something dissolving not in water but in light he could see the side of the blue cave through her very heart and she melted away till all that was left was a pale face like the moon in the morning with two great lucid eyes in it  i am going diamond she said  does it hurt you asked diamond  it's very uncomfortable she answered but i don't mind it for i shall come all right again before long i thought i should be able to go with you all the way but i cannot you must not be frightened though just go straight on and you will come all right you'll find me on the doorstep  as she spoke her face too faded quite away only diamond thought he could still see her eyes shining through the blue when he went closer however he found that what he thought her eyes were only two hollows in the ice north wind was quite gone and diamond would have cried if he had not trusted her so thoroughly so he sat still in the blue air of the cavern listening to the wash and ripple of the water all about the base of the iceberg as it sped on and on into the open sea northwards it was an excellent craft to go with the current for there was twice as much of it below water as above but a light south wind was blowing too and so it went fast  after a little while diamond went out and sat on the edge of his floating island and looked down into the ocean beneath him the white sides of the berg reflected so much light below the water that he could see far down into the green abyss sometimes he fancied he saw the eyes of north wind looking up at him from below but the fancy never lasted beyond the moment of its birth and the time passed he did not know how for he felt as if he were in a dream when he got tired of the green water he went into the blue cave and when he got tired of the blue cave he went out and gazed all about him on the blue sea ever sparkling in the sun which kept wheeling about the sky never going below the horizon but he chiefly gazed northwards to see whether any land were appearing all this time he never wanted to eat he broke off little bits of the berg now and then and sucked them and he thought them very nice  at length one time he came out of his cave he spied far off on the horizon a shining peak that rose into the sky like the top of some tremendous iceberg and his vessel was bearing him straight towards it as it went on the peak rose and rose higher and higher above the horizon and other peaks rose after it with sharp edges and jagged ridges connecting them diamond thought this must be the place he was going to and he was right for the mountains rose and rose till he saw the line of the coast at their feet and at length the iceberg drove into a little bay all around which were lofty precipices with snow on their tops and streaks of ice down their sides the berg floated slowly up to a projecting rock diamond stepped on shore and without looking behind him began to follow a natural path which led windingly towards the top of the precipice  when he reached it he found himself on a broad table of ice along which he could walk without much difficulty before him at a considerable distance rose a lofty ridge of ice which shot up into fantastic pinnacles and towers and battlements the air was very cold and seemed somehow dead for there was not the slightest breath of wind  in the centre of the ridge before him appeared a gap like the opening of a valley but as he walked towards it gazing and wondering whether that could be the way he had to take he saw that what had appeared a gap was the form of a woman seated against the ice front of the ridge leaning forwards with her hands in her lap and her hair hanging down to the ground  it is north wind on her doorstep said diamond joyfully and hurried on  he soon came up to the place and there the form sat like one of the great figures at the door of an egyptian temple motionless with drooping arms and head then diamond grew frightened because she did not move nor speak he was sure it was north wind but he thought she must be dead at last her face was white as the snow her eyes were blue as the air in the ice-cave and her hair hung down straight like icicles she had on a greenish robe like the colour in the hollows of a glacier seen from far off  he stood up before her and gazed fearfully into her face for a few minutes before he ventured to speak at length with a great effort and a trembling voice he faltered out   north wind  well child said the form without lifting its head  are you ill dear north wind  no i am waiting  what for  till i'm wanted  you don't care for me any more said diamond almost crying now  yes i do only i can't show it all my love is down at the bottom of my heart but i feel it bubbling there  what do you want me to do next dear north wind said diamond wishing to show his love by being obedient  what do you want to do yourself  i want to go into the country at your back  then you must go through me  i don't know what you mean  i mean just what i say you must walk on as if i were an open door and go right through me  but that will hurt you  not in the least it will hurt you though  i don't mind that if you tell me to do it  do it said north wind  diamond walked towards her instantly when he reached her knees he put out his hand to lay it on her but nothing was there save an intense cold he walked on then all grew white about him and the cold stung him like fire he walked on still groping through the whiteness it thickened about him at last it got into his heart and he lost all sense i would say that he fainted only whereas in common faints all grows black about you he felt swallowed up in whiteness it was when he reached north wind's heart that he fainted and fell but as he fell he rolled over the threshold and it was thus that diamond got to the back of the north wind     chapter x at the back of the north wind   i have now come to the most difficult part of my story and why because i do not know enough about it and why should i not know as much about this part as about any other part for of course i could know nothing about the story except diamond had told it and why should not diamond tell about the country at the back of the north wind as well as about his adventures in getting there because when he came back he had forgotten a great deal and what he did remember was very hard to tell things there are so different from things here the people there do not speak the same language for one thing indeed diamond insisted that there they do not speak at all i do not think he was right but it may well have appeared so to diamond the fact is we have different reports of the place from the most trustworthy people therefore we are bound to believe that it appears somewhat different to different people all however agree in a general way about it  i will tell you something of what two very different people have reported both of whom knew more about it i believe than herodotus one of them speaks from his own experience for he visited the country the other from the testimony of a young peasant girl who came back from it for a month's visit to her friends the former was a great italian of noble family who died more than five hundred years ago the latter a scotch shepherd who died not forty years ago  the italian then informs us that he had to enter that country through a fire so hot that he would have thrown himself into boiling glass to cool himself this was not diamond's experience but then durante that was the name of the italian and it means lasting for his books will last as long as there are enough men in the world worthy of having them durante was an elderly man and diamond was a little boy and so their experience must be a little different the peasant girl on the other hand fell fast asleep in a wood and woke in the same country  in describing it durante says that the ground everywhere smelt sweetly and that a gentle even-tempered wind which never blew faster or slower breathed in his face as he went making all the leaves point one way not so as to disturb the birds in the tops of the trees but on the contrary sounding a bass to their song he describes also a little river which was so full that its little waves as it hurried along bent the grass full of red and yellow flowers through which it flowed he says that the purest stream in the world beside this one would look as if it were mixed with something that did not belong to it even although it was flowing ever in the brown shadow of the trees and neither sun nor moon could shine upon it he seems to imply that it is always the month of may in that country it would be out of place to describe here the wonderful sights he saw for the music of them is in another key from that of this story and i shall therefore only add from the account of this traveller that the people there are so free and so just and so healthy that every one of them has a crown like a king and a mitre like a priest  the peasant girl kilmeny was her name could not report such grand things as durante for as the shepherd says telling her story as i tell diamond's              kilmeny had been she knew not where            and kilmeny had seen what she could not declare            kilmeny had been where the cock never crew            where the rain never fell and the wind never blew            but it seemed as the harp of the sky had rung            and the airs of heaven played round her tongue            when she spoke of the lovely forms she had seen            and a land where sin had never been            a land of love and a land of light            withouten sun or moon or night            where the river swayed a living stream            and the light a pure and cloudless beam             the land of vision it would seem            and still an everlasting dream   the last two lines are the shepherd's own remark and a matter of opinion but it is clear i think that kilmeny must have described the same country as durante saw though not having his experience she could neither understand nor describe it so well  now i must give you such fragments of recollection as diamond was able to bring back with him  when he came to himself after he fell he found himself at the back of the north wind north wind herself was nowhere to be seen neither was there a vestige of snow or of ice within sight the sun too had vanished but that was no matter for there was plenty of a certain still rayless light where it came from he never found out but he thought it belonged to the country itself sometimes he thought it came out of the flowers which were very bright but had no strong colour he said the river for all agree that there is a river there flowed not only through but over grass  its channel instead of being rock stones pebbles sand or anything else was of pure meadow grass not over long he insisted that if it did not sing tunes in people's ears it sung tunes in their heads in proof of which i may mention that in the troubles which followed diamond was often heard singing and when asked what he was singing would answer one of the tunes the river at the back of the north wind sung and i may as well say at once that diamond never told these things to any one but no i had better not say who it was but whoever it was told me and i thought it would be well to write them for my child-readers  he could not say he was very happy there for he had neither his father nor mother with him but he felt so still and quiet and patient and contented that as far as the mere feeling went it was something better than mere happiness nothing went wrong at the back of the north wind neither was anything quite right he thought only everything was going to be right some day his account disagreed with that of durante and agreed with that of kilmeny in this that he protested there was no wind there at all i fancy he missed it at all events we could not do without wind it all depends on how big our lungs are whether the wind is too strong for us or not  when the person he told about it asked him whether he saw anybody he knew there he answered only a little girl belonging to the gardener who thought he had lost her but was quite mistaken for there she was safe enough and was to come back some day as i came back if they would only wait  did you talk to her diamond  no nobody talks there they only look at each other and understand everything  is it cold there  no  is it hot  no  what is it then  you never think about such things there  what a queer place it must be  it's a very good place  do you want to go back again  no i don't think i have left it i feel it here somewhere  did the people there look pleased  yes quite pleased only a little sad  then they didn't look glad  they looked as if they were waiting to be gladder some day  this was how diamond used to answer questions about that country and now i will take up the story again and tell you how he got back to this country     chapter xi how diamond got home again   when one at the back of the north wind wanted to know how things were going with any one he loved he had to go to a certain tree climb the stem and sit down in the branches in a few minutes if he kept very still he would see something at least of what was going on with the people he loved  one day when diamond was sitting in this tree he began to long very much to get home again and no wonder for he saw his mother crying durante says that the people there may always follow their wishes because they never wish but what is good diamond's wish was to get home and he would fain follow his wish  but how was he to set about it if he could only see north wind but the moment he had got to her back she was gone altogether from his sight he had never seen her back she might be sitting on her doorstep still looking southwards and waiting white and thin and blue-eyed until she was wanted or she might have again become a mighty creature with power to do that which was demanded of her and gone far away upon many missions she must be somewhere however he could not go home without her and therefore he must find her she could never have intended to leave him always away from his mother if there had been any danger of that she would have told him and given him his choice about going for north wind was right honest how to find north wind therefore occupied all his thoughts  in his anxiety about his mother he used to climb the tree every day and sit in its branches however many of the dwellers there did so they never incommoded one another for the moment one got into the tree he became invisible to every one else and it was such a wide-spreading tree that there was room for every one of the people of the country in it without the least interference with each other sometimes on getting down two of them would meet at the root and then they would smile to each other more sweetly than at any other time as much as to say ah you've been up there too  one day he was sitting on one of the outer branches of the tree looking southwards after his home far away was a blue shining sea dotted with gleaming and sparkling specks of white those were the icebergs nearer he saw a great range of snow-capped mountains and down below him the lovely meadow-grass of the country with the stream flowing and flowing through it away towards the sea as he looked he began to wonder for the whole country lay beneath him like a map and that which was near him looked just as small as that which he knew to be miles away the ridge of ice which encircled it appeared but a few yards off and no larger than the row of pebbles with which a child will mark out the boundaries of the kingdom he has appropriated on the sea-shore he thought he could distinguish the vapoury form of north wind seated as he had left her on the other side hastily he descended the tree and to his amazement found that the map or model of the country still lay at his feet he stood in it with one stride he had crossed the river with another he had reached the ridge of ice with the third he stepped over its peaks and sank wearily down at north wind's knees for there she sat on her doorstep the peaks of the great ridge of ice were as lofty as ever behind her and the country at her back had vanished from diamond's view  north wind was as still as diamond had left her her pale face was white as the snow and her motionless eyes were as blue as the caverns in the ice but the instant diamond touched her her face began to change like that of one waking from sleep light began to glimmer from the blue of her eyes  a moment more and she laid her hand on diamond's head and began playing with his hair diamond took hold of her hand and laid his face to it she gave a little start  how very alive you are child she murmured come nearer to me  by the help of the stones all around he clambered up beside her and laid himself against her bosom she gave a great sigh slowly lifted her arms and slowly folded them about him until she clasped him close yet a moment and she roused herself and came quite awake and the cold of her bosom which had pierced diamond's bones vanished  have you been sitting here ever since i went through you dear north wind asked diamond stroking her hand  yes she answered looking at him with her old kindness  ain't you very tired  no i've often had to sit longer do you know how long you have been  oh years and years answered diamond  you have just been seven days returned north wind  i thought i had been a hundred years exclaimed diamond  yes i daresay replied north wind you've been away from here seven days but how long you may have been in there is quite another thing behind my back and before my face things are so different they don't go at all by the same rule  i'm very glad said diamond after thinking a while  why asked north wind  because i've been such a long time there and such a little while away from mother why she won't be expecting me home from sandwich yet  no but we mustn't talk any longer i've got my orders now and we must be off in a few minutes  next moment diamond found himself sitting alone on the rock north wind had vanished a creature like a great humble-bee or cockchafer flew past his face but it could be neither for there were no insects amongst the ice it passed him again and again flying in circles around him and he concluded that it must be north wind herself no bigger than tom thumb when his mother put him in the nutshell lined with flannel but she was no longer vapoury and thin she was solid although tiny a moment more and she perched on his shoulder  come along diamond she said in his ear in the smallest and highest of treble voices it is time we were setting out for sandwich  diamond could just see her by turning his head towards his shoulder as far as he could but only with one eye for his nose came between her and the other  won't you take me in your arms and carry me he said in a whisper for he knew she did not like a loud voice when she was small  ah you ungrateful boy returned north wind smiling how dare you make game of me yes i will carry you but you shall walk a bit for your impertinence first come along  she jumped from his shoulder but when diamond looked for her upon the ground he could see nothing but a little spider with long legs that made its way over the ice towards the south it ran very fast indeed for a spider but diamond ran a long way before it and then waited for it it was up with him sooner than he had expected however and it had grown a good deal and the spider grew and grew and went faster and faster till all at once diamond discovered that it was not a spider but a weasel and away glided the weasel and away went diamond after it and it took all the run there was in him to keep up with the weasel and the weasel grew and grew and grew till all at once diamond saw that the weasel was not a weasel but a cat and away went the cat and diamond after it and when he had run half a mile he found the cat waiting for him sitting up and washing her face not to lose time and away went the cat again and diamond after it but the next time he came up with the cat the cat was not a cat but a hunting-leopard and the hunting-leopard grew to a jaguar all covered with spots like eyes and the jaguar grew to a bengal tiger and at none of them was diamond afraid for he had been at north wind's back and he could be afraid of her no longer whatever she did or grew and the tiger flew over the snow in a straight line for the south growing less and less to diamond's eyes till it was only a black speck upon the whiteness and then it vanished altogether and now diamond felt that he would rather not run any farther and that the ice had got very rough besides he was near the precipices that bounded the sea so he slackened his pace to a walk saying aloud to himself   when north wind has punished me enough for making game of her she will come back to me i know she will for i can't go much farther without her  you dear boy it was only in fun here i am said north wind's voice behind him  diamond turned and saw her as he liked best to see her standing beside him a tall lady  where's the tiger he asked for he knew all the creatures from a picture book that miss coleman had given him but of course he added you were the tiger i was puzzled and forgot i saw it such a long way off before me and there you were behind me it's so odd you know  it must look very odd to you diamond  i see that but it is no more odd to me than to break an old pine in two  well that's odd enough remarked diamond  so it is i forgot well none of these things are odder to me than it is to you to eat bread and butter  well that's odd too when i think of it persisted diamond i should just like a slice of bread and butter i'm afraid to say how long it is how long it seems to me that is since i had anything to eat  come then said north wind stooping and holding out her arms you shall have some bread and butter very soon i am glad to find you want some  diamond held up his arms to meet hers and was safe upon her bosom north wind bounded into the air her tresses began to lift and rise and spread and stream and flow and flutter and with a roar from her hair and an answering roar from one of the great glaciers beside them whose slow torrent tumbled two or three icebergs at once into the waves at their feet north wind and diamond went flying southwards     chapter xii who met diamond at sandwich   as they flew so fast they went that the sea slid away from under them like a great web of shot silk blue shot with grey and green shot with purple they went so fast that the stars themselves appeared to sail away past them overhead like golden boats on a blue sea turned upside down and they went so fast that diamond himself went the other way as fast i mean he went fast asleep in north wind's arms  when he woke a face was bending over him but it was not north wind's it was his mother's he put out his arms to her and she clasped him to her bosom and burst out crying diamond kissed her again and again to make her stop perhaps kissing is the best thing for crying but it will not always stop it  what is the matter mother he said  oh diamond my darling you have been so ill she sobbed  no mother dear i've only been at the back of the north wind  returned diamond  i thought you were dead said his mother  but that moment the doctor came in  oh there said the doctor with gentle cheerfulness we're better to-day i see  then he drew the mother aside and told her not to talk to diamond or to mind what he might say for he must be kept as quiet as possible and indeed diamond was not much inclined to talk for he felt very strange and weak which was little wonder seeing that all the time he had been away he had only sucked a few lumps of ice and there could not be much nourishment in them  now while he is lying there getting strong again with chicken broth and other nice things i will tell my readers what had been taking place at his home for they ought to be told it  they may have forgotten that miss coleman was in a very poor state of health now there were three reasons for this in the first place her lungs were not strong in the second place there was a gentleman somewhere who had not behaved very well to her in the third place she had not anything particular to do these three nots together are enough to make a lady very ill indeed of course she could not help the first cause but if the other two causes had not existed that would have been of little consequence she would only have to be a little careful the second she could not help quite but if she had had anything to do and had done it well it would have been very difficult for any man to behave badly to her and for this third cause of her illness if she had had anything to do that was worth doing she might have borne his bad behaviour so that even that would not have made her ill it is not always easy i confess to find something to do that is worth doing but the most difficult things are constantly being done and she might have found something if she had tried her fault lay in this that she had not tried but to be sure her father and mother were to blame that they had never set her going only then again nobody had told her father and mother that they ought to set her going in that direction so as none of them would find it out of themselves north wind had to teach them  we know that north wind was very busy that night on which she left diamond in the cathedral she had in a sense been blowing through and through the colemans' house the whole of the night first miss coleman's maid had left a chink of her mistress's window open thinking she had shut it and north wind had wound a few of her hairs round the lady's throat she was considerably worse the next morning again the ship which north wind had sunk that very night belonged to mr coleman nor will my readers understand what a heavy loss this was to him until i have informed them that he had been getting poorer and poorer for some time he was not so successful in his speculations as he had been for he speculated a great deal more than was right and it was time he should be pulled up it is a hard thing for a rich man to grow poor but it is an awful thing for him to grow dishonest and some kinds of speculation lead a man deep into dishonesty before he thinks what he is about poverty will not make a man worthless he may be worth a great deal more when he is poor than he was when he was rich but dishonesty goes very far indeed to make a man of no value a thing to be thrown out in the dust-hole of the creation like a bit of a broken basin or a dirty rag so north wind had to look after mr coleman and try to make an honest man of him so she sank the ship which was his last venture and he was what himself and his wife and the world called ruined  nor was this all yet for on board that vessel miss coleman's lover was a passenger and when the news came that the vessel had gone down and that all on board had perished we may be sure she did not think the loss of their fine house and garden and furniture the greatest misfortune in the world  of course the trouble did not end with mr coleman and his family nobody can suffer alone when the cause of suffering is most deeply hidden in the heart and nobody knows anything about it but the man himself he must be a great and a good man indeed such as few of us have known if the pain inside him does not make him behave so as to cause all about him to be more or less uncomfortable but when a man brings money-troubles on himself by making haste to be rich then most of the people he has to do with must suffer in the same way with himself the elm-tree which north wind blew down that very night as if small and great trials were to be gathered in one heap crushed miss coleman's pretty summer-house  just so the fall of mr coleman crushed the little family that lived over his coach-house and stable before diamond was well enough to be taken home there was no home for him to go to mr coleman or his creditors for i do not know the particulars had sold house carriage horses furniture and everything he and his wife and daughter and mrs crump had gone to live in a small house in hoxton where he would be unknown and whence he could walk to his place of business in the city for he was not an old man and hoped yet to retrieve his fortunes let us hope that he lived to retrieve his honesty the tail of which had slipped through his fingers to the very last joint if not beyond it  of course diamond's father had nothing to do for a time but it was not so hard for him to have nothing to do as it was for miss coleman he wrote to his wife that if her sister would keep her there till he got a place it would be better for them and he would be greatly obliged to her meantime the gentleman who had bought the house had allowed his furniture to remain where it was for a little while  diamond's aunt was quite willing to keep them as long as she could and indeed diamond was not yet well enough to be moved with safety  when he had recovered so far as to be able to go out one day his mother got her sister's husband who had a little pony-cart to carry them down to the sea-shore and leave them there for a few hours he had some business to do further on at ramsgate and would pick them up as he returned a whiff of the sea-air would do them both good she said and she thought besides she could best tell diamond what had happened if she had him quite to herself     chapter xiii the seaside   diamond and his mother sat down upon the edge of the rough grass that bordered the sand the sun was just far enough past its highest not to shine in their eyes when they looked eastward a sweet little wind blew on their left side and comforted the mother without letting her know what it was that comforted her away before them stretched the sparkling waters of the ocean every wave of which flashed out its own delight back in the face of the great sun which looked down from the stillness of its blue house with glorious silent face upon its flashing children on each hand the shore rounded outwards forming a little bay there were no white cliffs here as further north and south and the place was rather dreary but the sky got at them so much the better not a house not a creature was within sight dry sand was about their feet and under them thin wiry grass that just managed to grow out of the poverty-stricken shore  oh dear said diamond's mother with a deep sigh it's a sad world  is it said diamond i didn't know  how should you know child you've been too well taken care of i trust  oh yes i have returned diamond i'm sorry i thought you were taken care of too i thought my father took care of you i will ask him about it i think he must have forgotten  dear boy said his mother your father's the best man in the world  so i thought returned diamond with triumph i was sure of it well doesn't he take very good care of you  yes yes he does answered his mother bursting into tears but who's to take care of him and how is he to take care of us if he's got nothing to eat himself  oh dear said diamond with a gasp hasn't he got anything to eat oh i must go home to him  no no child he's not come to that yet but what's to become of us i don't know  are you very hungry mother there's the basket i thought you put something to eat in it  o you darling stupid i didn't say i was hungry returned his mother smiling through her tears  then i don't understand you at all said diamond do tell me what's the matter  there are people in the world who have nothing to eat diamond  then i suppose they don't stop in it any longer they they what you call die don't they  yes they do how would you like that  i don't know i never tried but i suppose they go where they get something to eat  like enough they don't want it said his mother petulantly  that's all right then said diamond thinking i daresay more than he chose to put in words  is it though poor boy how little you know about things mr coleman's lost all his money and your father has nothing to do and we shall have nothing to eat by and by  are you sure mother  sure of what  sure that we shall have nothing to eat  no thank heaven i'm not sure of it i hope not  then i can't understand it mother there's a piece of gingerbread in the basket i know  o you little bird you have no more sense than a sparrow that picks what it wants and never thinks of the winter and the frost and the snow  ah yes i see but the birds get through the winter don't they  some of them fall dead on the ground  they must die some time they wouldn't like to be birds always would you mother  what a child it is thought his mother but she said nothing  oh now i remember diamond went on father told me that day i went to epping forest with him that the rose-bushes and the may-bushes and the holly-bushes were the bird's barns for there were the hips and the haws and the holly-berries all ready for the winter  yes that's all very true so you see the birds are provided for but there are no such barns for you and me diamond  ain't there  no we've got to work for our bread  then let's go and work said diamond getting up  it's no use we've not got anything to do  then let's wait  then we shall starve  no there's the basket do you know mother i think i shall call that basket the barn  it's not a very big one and when it's empty where are we then  at auntie's cupboard returned diamond promptly  but we can't eat auntie's things all up and leave her to starve  no no we'll go back to father before that he'll have found a cupboard somewhere by that time  how do you know that  i don't know it but i haven't got even a cupboard and i've always had plenty to eat i've heard you say i had too much sometimes  but i tell you that's because i've had a cupboard for you child  and when yours was empty auntie opened hers  but that can't go on  how do you know i think there must be a big cupboard somewhere out of which the little cupboards are filled you know mother  well i wish i could find the door of that cupboard said his mother but the same moment she stopped and was silent for a good while i cannot tell whether diamond knew what she was thinking but i think i know she had heard something at church the day before which came back upon her something like this that she hadn't to eat for tomorrow as well as for to-day and that what was not wanted couldn't be missed so instead of saying anything more she stretched out her hand for the basket and she and diamond had their dinner  and diamond did enjoy it for the drive and the fresh air had made him quite hungry and he did not like his mother trouble himself about what they should dine off that day week the fact was he had lived so long without any food at all at the back of the north wind that he knew quite well that food was not essential to existence that in fact under certain circumstances people could live without it well enough  his mother did not speak much during their dinner after it was over she helped him to walk about a little but he was not able for much and soon got tired he did not get fretful though he was too glad of having the sun and the wind again to fret because he could not run about he lay down on the dry sand and his mother covered him with a shawl she then sat by his side and took a bit of work from her pocket but diamond felt rather sleepy and turned on his side and gazed sleepily over the sand a few yards off he saw something fluttering  what is that mother he said  only a bit of paper she answered  it flutters more than a bit of paper would i think said diamond  i'll go and see if you like said his mother my eyes are none of the best  so she rose and went and found that they were both right for it was a little book partly buried in the sand but several of its leaves were clear of the sand and these the wind kept blowing about in a very flutterful manner she took it up and brought it to diamond  what is it mother he asked  some nursery rhymes i think she answered  i'm too sleepy said diamond do read some of them to me  yes i will she said and began one but this is such nonsense  she said again i will try to find a better one  she turned the leaves searching but three times with sudden puffs the wind blew the leaves rustling back to the same verses  do read that one said diamond who seemed to be of the same mind as the wind it sounded very nice i am sure it is a good one  so his mother thought it might amuse him though she couldn't find any sense in it she never thought he might understand it although she could not  now i do not exactly know what the mother read but this is what diamond heard or thought afterwards that he had heard he was however as i have said very sleepy and when he thought he understood the verses he may have been only dreaming better ones this is how they went   i know a river whose waters run asleep run run ever singing in the shallows dumb in the hollows sleeping so deep and all the swallows that dip their feathers in the hollows or in the shallows are the merriest swallows of all for the nests they bake with the clay they cake with the water they shake from their wings that rake the water out of the shallows or the hollows will hold together in any weather and so the swallows are the merriest fellows and have the merriest children and are built so narrow like the head of an arrow to cut the air and go just where the nicest water is flowing and the nicest dust is blowing for each so narrow like head of an arrow is only a barrow to carry the mud he makes from the nicest water flowing and the nicest dust that is blowing to build his nest for her he loves best with the nicest cakes which the sunshine bakes all for their merry children all so callow with beaks that follow gaping and hollow wider and wider after their father or after their mother the food-provider who brings them a spider or a worm the poor hider down in the earth so there's no dearth for their beaks as yellow as the buttercups growing beside the flowing of the singing river always and ever growing and blowing for fast as the sheep awake or asleep crop them and crop them they cannot stop them but up they creep and on they go blowing and so with the daisies the little white praises they grow and they blow and they spread out their crown and they praise the sun and when he goes down their praising is done and they fold up their crown and they sleep every one till over the plain he's shining amain and they're at it again praising and praising such low songs raising that no one hears them but the sun who rears them and the sheep that bite them are the quietest sheep awake or asleep with the merriest bleat and the little lambs are the merriest lambs they forget to eat for the frolic in their feet and the lambs and their dams are the whitest sheep with the woolliest wool and the longest wool and the trailingest tails and they shine like snow in the grasses that grow by the singing river that sings for ever and the sheep and the lambs are merry for ever because the river sings and they drink it and the lambs and their dams are quiet and white because of their diet for what they bite is buttercups yellow and daisies white and grass as green as the river can make it with wind as mellow to kiss it and shake it as never was seen but here in the hollows beside the river where all the swallows are merriest of fellows for the nests they make with the clay they cake in the sunshine bake till they are like bone as dry in the wind as a marble stone so firm they bind the grass in the clay that dries in the wind the sweetest wind that blows by the river flowing for ever but never you find whence comes the wind that blows on the hollows and over the shallows where dip the swallows alive it blows the life as it goes awake or asleep into the river that sings as it flows and the life it blows into the sheep awake or asleep with the woolliest wool and the trailingest tails and it never fails gentle and cool to wave the wool and to toss the grass as the lambs and the sheep over it pass and tug and bite with their teeth so white and then with the sweep of their trailing tails smooth it again and it grows amain and amain it grows and the wind as it blows tosses the swallows over the hollows and down on the shallows till every feather doth shake and quiver and all their feathers go all together blowing the life and the joy so rife into the swallows that skim the shallows and have the yellowest children for the wind that blows is the life of the river flowing for ever that washes the grasses still as it passes and feeds the daisies the little white praises and buttercups bonny so golden and sunny with butter and honey that whiten the sheep awake or asleep that nibble and bite and grow whiter than white and merry and quiet on the sweet diet fed by the river and tossed for ever by the wind that tosses the swallow that crosses over the shallows dipping his wings to gather the water and bake the cake that the wind shall make as hard as a bone as dry as a stone it's all in the wind that blows from behind and all in the river that flows for ever and all in the grasses and the white daisies and the merry sheep awake or asleep and the happy swallows skimming the shallows and it's all in the wind that blows from behind   here diamond became aware that his mother had stopped reading  why don't you go on mother dear he asked  it's such nonsense said his mother i believe it would go on for ever  that's just what it did said diamond  what did she asked  why the river that's almost the very tune it used to sing  his mother was frightened for she thought the fever was coming on again so she did not contradict him  who made that poem asked diamond  i don't know she answered some silly woman for her children i suppose and then thought it good enough to print  she must have been at the back of the north wind some time or other anyhow said diamond she couldn't have got a hold of it anywhere else that's just how it went and he began to chant bits of it here and there but his mother said nothing for fear of making him worse and she was very glad indeed when she saw her brother-in-law jogging along in his little cart they lifted diamond in and got up themselves and away they went home again home again home again as diamond sang but he soon grew quiet and before they reached sandwich he was fast asleep and dreaming of the country at the back of the north wind     chapter xiv old diamond   after this diamond recovered so fast that in a few days he was quite able to go home as soon as his father had a place for them to go now his father having saved a little money and finding that no situation offered itself had been thinking over a new plan a strange occurrence it was which turned his thoughts in that direction he had a friend in the bloomsbury region who lived by letting out cabs and horses to the cabmen this man happening to meet him one day as he was returning from an unsuccessful application said to him   why don't you set up for yourself now in the cab line i mean  i haven't enough for that answered diamond's father  you must have saved a goodish bit i should think just come home with me now and look at a horse i can let you have cheap i bought him only a few weeks ago thinking he'd do for a hansom but i was wrong he's got bone enough for a waggon but a waggon ain't a hansom he ain't got go enough for a hansom you see parties as takes hansoms wants to go like the wind and he ain't got wind enough for he ain't so young as he once was but for a four-wheeler as takes families and their luggages he's the very horse he'd carry a small house any day i bought him cheap and i'll sell him cheap  oh i don't want him said diamond's father a body must have time to think over an affair of so much importance and there's the cab too that would come to a deal of money  i could fit you there i daresay said his friend but come and look at the animal anyhow  since i lost my own old pair as was mr coleman's said diamond's father turning to accompany the cab-master i ain't almost got the heart to look a horse in the face it's a thousand pities to part man and horse  so it is returned his friend sympathetically  but what was the ex-coachman's delight when on going into the stable where his friend led him he found the horse he wanted him to buy was no other than his own old diamond grown very thin and bony and long-legged as if they had been doing what they could to fit him for hansom work  he ain't a hansom horse said diamond's father indignantly  well you're right he ain't handsome but he's a good un said his owner  who says he ain't handsome he's one of the handsomest horses a gentleman's coachman ever druv said diamond's father remarking to himself under his breath though i says it as shouldn't for he did not feel inclined all at once to confess that his own old horse could have sunk so low  well said his friend all i say is there's a animal for you as strong as a church an'll go like a train leastways a parly he added correcting himself  but the coachman had a lump in his throat and tears in his eyes for the old horse hearing his voice had turned his long neck and when his old friend went up to him and laid his hand on his side he whinnied for joy and laid his big head on his master's breast this settled the matter the coachman's arms were round the horse's neck in a moment and he fairly broke down and cried the cab-master had never been so fond of a horse himself as to hug him like that but he saw in a moment how it was and he must have been a good-hearted fellow for i never heard of such an idea coming into the head of any other man with a horse to sell  instead of putting something on to the price because he was now pretty sure of selling him he actually took a pound off what he had meant to ask for him saying to himself it was a shame to part old friends  diamond's father as soon as he came to himself turned and asked how much he wanted for the horse  i see you're old friends said the owner  it's my own old diamond i liked him far the best of the pair though the other was good you ain't got him too have you  no nothing in the stable to match him there  i believe you said the coachman but you'll be wanting a long price for him i know  no not so much i bought him cheap and as i say he ain't for my work  the end of it was that diamond's father bought old diamond again along with a four-wheeled cab and as there were some rooms to be had over the stable he took them wrote to his wife to come home and set up as a cabman     chapter xv the mews   it was late in the afternoon when diamond and his mother and the baby reached london i was so full of diamond that i forgot to tell you a baby had arrived in the meantime his father was waiting for them with his own cab but they had not told diamond who the horse was for his father wanted to enjoy the pleasure of his surprise when he found it out he got in with his mother without looking at the horse and his father having put up diamond's carpet-bag and his mother's little trunk got upon the box himself and drove off and diamond was quite proud of riding home in his father's own carriage but when he got to the mews he could not help being a little dismayed at first and if he had never been to the back of the north wind i am afraid he would have cried a little but instead of that he said to himself it was a fine thing all the old furniture was there and instead of helping his mother to be miserable at the change he began to find out all the advantages of the place for every place has some advantages and they are always better worth knowing than the disadvantages certainly the weather was depressing for a thick dull persistent rain was falling by the time they reached home but happily the weather is very changeable and besides there was a good fire burning in the room which their neighbour with the drunken husband had attended to for them and the tea-things were put out and the kettle was boiling on the fire and with a good fire and tea and bread and butter things cannot be said to be miserable  diamond's father and mother were notwithstanding rather miserable and diamond began to feel a kind of darkness beginning to spread over his own mind but the same moment he said to himself this will never do i can't give in to this i've been to the back of the north wind things go right there and so i must try to get things to go right here i've got to fight the miserable things they shan't make me miserable if i can help it i do not mean that he thought these very words they are perhaps too grown-up for him to have thought but they represent the kind of thing that was in his heart and his head and when heart and head go together nothing can stand before them  what nice bread and butter this is said diamond  i'm glad you like it my dear said his father i bought the butter myself at the little shop round the corner  it's very nice thank you father oh there's baby waking i'll take him  sit still diamond said his mother go on with your bread and butter you're not strong enough to lift him yet  so she took the baby herself and set him on her knee then diamond began to amuse him and went on till the little fellow was shrieking with laughter for the baby's world was his mother's arms and the drizzling rain and the dreary mews and even his father's troubled face could not touch him what cared baby for the loss of a hundred situations yet neither father nor mother thought him hard-hearted because he crowed and laughed in the middle of their troubles on the contrary his crowing and laughing were infectious his little heart was so full of merriment that it could not hold it all and it ran over into theirs father and mother began to laugh too and diamond laughed till he had a fit of coughing which frightened his mother and made them all stop his father took the baby and his mother put him to bed  but it was indeed a change to them all not only from sandwich but from their old place instead of the great river where the huge barges with their mighty brown and yellow sails went tacking from side to side like little pleasure-skiffs and where the long thin boats shot past with eight and sometimes twelve rowers their windows now looked out upon a dirty paved yard and there was no garden more for diamond to run into when he pleased with gay flowers about his feet and solemn sun-filled trees over his head neither was there a wooden wall at the back of his bed with a hole in it for north wind to come in at when she liked indeed there was such a high wall and there were so many houses about the mews that north wind seldom got into the place at all except when something must be done and she had a grand cleaning out like other housewives while the partition at the head of diamond's new bed only divided it from the room occupied by a cabman who drank too much beer and came home chiefly to quarrel with his wife and pinch his children it was dreadful to diamond to hear the scolding and the crying but it could not make him miserable because he had been at the back of the north wind  if my reader find it hard to believe that diamond should be so good he must remember that he had been to the back of the north wind if he never knew a boy so good did he ever know a boy that had been to the back of the north wind it was not in the least strange of diamond to behave as he did on the contrary it was thoroughly sensible of him  we shall see how he got on     chapter xvi diamond makes a beginning   the wind blew loud but diamond slept a deep sleep and never heard it my own impression is that every time when diamond slept well and remembered nothing about it in the morning he had been all that night at the back of the north wind i am almost sure that was how he woke so refreshed and felt so quiet and hopeful all the day indeed he said this much though not to me that always when he woke from such a sleep there was a something in his mind he could not tell what could not tell whether it was the last far-off sounds of the river dying away in the distance or some of the words of the endless song his mother had read to him on the sea-shore sometimes he thought it must have been the twittering of the swallows over the shallows you know but it may have been the chirping of the dingy sparrows picking up their breakfast in the yard how can i tell i don't know what i know i only know what i think and to tell the truth i am more for the swallows than the sparrows when he knew he was coming awake he would sometimes try hard to keep hold of the words of what seemed a new song one he had not heard before a song in which the words and the music somehow appeared to be all one but even when he thought he had got them well fixed in his mind ever as he came awaker as he would say one line faded away out of it and then another and then another till at last there was nothing left but some lovely picture of water or grass or daisies or something else very common but with all the commonness polished off it and the lovely soul of it which people so seldom see and alas yet seldomer believe in shining out but after that he would sing the oddest loveliest little songs to the baby of his own making his mother said but diamond said he did not make them they were made somewhere inside him and he knew nothing about them till they were coming out  when he woke that first morning he got up at once saying to himself i've been ill long enough and have given a great deal of trouble i must try and be of use now and help my mother when he went into her room he found her lighting the fire and his father just getting out of bed they had only the one room besides the little one not much more than a closet in which diamond slept he began at once to set things to rights but the baby waking up he took him and nursed him till his mother had got the breakfast ready she was looking gloomy and his father was silent and indeed except diamond had done all he possibly could to keep out the misery that was trying to get in at doors and windows he too would have grown miserable and then they would have been all miserable together but to try to make others comfortable is the only way to get right comfortable ourselves and that comes partly of not being able to think so much about ourselves when we are helping other people for our selves will always do pretty well if we don't pay them too much attention our selves are like some little children who will be happy enough so long as they are left to their own games but when we begin to interfere with them and make them presents of too nice playthings or too many sweet things they begin at once to fret and spoil  why diamond child said his mother at last you're as good to your mother as if you were a girl nursing the baby and toasting the bread and sweeping up the hearth i declare a body would think you had been among the fairies  could diamond have had greater praise or greater pleasure you see when he forgot his self his mother took care of his self and loved and praised his self our own praises poison our selves and puff and swell them up till they lose all shape and beauty and become like great toadstools but the praises of father or mother do our selves good and comfort them and make them beautiful they never do them any harm if they do any harm it comes of our mixing some of our own praises with them and that turns them nasty and slimy and poisonous  when his father had finished his breakfast which he did rather in a hurry he got up and went down into the yard to get out his horse and put him to the cab  won't you come and see the cab diamond he said  yes please father if mother can spare me a minute answered diamond  bless the child i don't want him said his mother cheerfully  but as he was following his father out of the door she called him back  diamond just hold the baby one minute i have something to say to your father  so diamond sat down again took the baby in his lap and began poking his face into its little body laughing and singing all the while so that the baby crowed like a little bantam and what he sang was something like this such nonsense to those that couldn't understand it but not to the baby who got all the good in the world out of it   baby's a-sleeping wake up baby for all the swallows are the merriest fellows and have the yellowest children who would go sleeping and snore like a gaby disturbing his mother and father and brother and all a-boring their ears with his snoring snoring snoring for himself and no other for himself in particular wake up baby sit up perpendicular hark to the gushing hark to the rushing where the sheep are the woolliest and the lambs the unruliest and their tails the whitest and their eyes the brightest and baby's the bonniest and baby's the funniest and baby's the shiniest and baby's the tiniest and baby's the merriest and baby's the worriest of all the lambs that plague their dams and mother's the whitest of all the dams that feed the lambs that go crop-cropping without stop-stopping and father's the best of all the swallows that build their nest out of the shining shallows and he has the merriest children that's baby and diamond and diamond and baby and baby and diamond and diamond and baby    here diamond's knees went off in a wild dance which tossed the baby about and shook the laughter out of him in immoderate peals his mother had been listening at the door to the last few lines of his song and came in with the tears in her eyes she took the baby from him gave him a kiss and told him to run to his father  by the time diamond got into the yard the horse was between the shafts and his father was looping the traces on diamond went round to look at the horse the sight of him made him feel very queer he did not know much about different horses and all other horses than their own were very much the same to him but he could not make it out this was diamond and it wasn't diamond diamond didn't hang his head like that yet the head that was hanging was very like the one that diamond used to hold so high diamond's bones didn't show through his skin like that but the skin they pushed out of shape so was very like diamond's skin and the bones might be diamond's bones for he had never seen the shape of them but when he came round in front of the old horse and he put out his long neck and began sniffing at him and rubbing his upper lip and his nose on him then diamond saw it could be no other than old diamond and he did just as his father had done before put his arms round his neck and cried but not much  ain't it jolly father he said was there ever anybody so lucky as me dear old diamond  and he hugged the horse again and kissed both his big hairy cheeks he could only manage one at a time however the other cheek was so far off on the other side of his big head  his father mounted the box with just the same air as diamond thought with which he had used to get upon the coach-box and diamond said to himself father's as grand as ever anyhow he had kept his brown livery-coat only his wife had taken the silver buttons off and put brass ones instead because they did not think it polite to mr coleman in his fallen fortunes to let his crest be seen upon the box of a cab old diamond had kept just his collar and that had the silver crest upon it still for his master thought nobody would notice that and so let it remain for a memorial of the better days of which it reminded him not unpleasantly seeing it had been by no fault either of his or of the old horse's that they had come down in the world together  oh father do let me drive a bit said diamond jumping up on the box beside him  his father changed places with him at once putting the reins into his hands diamond gathered them up eagerly  don't pull at his mouth said his father just feel at it gently to let him know you're there and attending to him that's what i call talking to him through the reins  yes father i understand said diamond then to the horse he said go on diamond and old diamond's ponderous bulk began at once to move to the voice of the little boy  but before they had reached the entrance of the mews another voice called after young diamond which in his turn he had to obey for it was that of his mother diamond diamond it cried and diamond pulled the reins and the horse stood still as a stone  husband said his mother coming up you're never going to trust him with the reins a baby like that  he must learn some day and he can't begin too soon i see already he's a born coachman said his father proudly and i don't see well how he could escape it for my father and my grandfather that's his great-grandfather was all coachmen i'm told so it must come natural to him any one would think besides you see old diamond's as proud of him as we are our own selves wife don't you see how he's turning round his ears with the mouths of them open for the first word he speaks to tumble in he's too well bred to turn his head you know  well but husband i can't do without him to-day everything's got to be done you know it's my first day here and there's that baby  bless you wife i never meant to take him away only to the bottom of endell street he can watch his way back  no thank you father not to-day said diamond mother wants me perhaps she'll let me go another day  very well my man said his father and took the reins which diamond was holding out to him  diamond got down a little disappointed of course and went with his mother who was too pleased to speak she only took hold of his hand as tight as if she had been afraid of his running away instead of glad that he would not leave her  now although they did not know it the owner of the stables the same man who had sold the horse to his father had been standing just inside one of the stable-doors with his hands in his pockets and had heard and seen all that passed and from that day john stonecrop took a great fancy to the little boy and this was the beginning of what came of it  the same evening just as diamond was feeling tired of the day's work and wishing his father would come home mr stonecrop knocked at the door his mother went and opened it  good evening ma'am said he is the little master in  yes to be sure he is at your service i'm sure mr stonecrop said his mother  no no ma'am it's i'm at his service i'm just a-going out with my own cab and if he likes to come with me he shall drive my old horse till he's tired  it's getting rather late for him said his mother thoughtfully you see he's been an invalid  diamond thought what a funny thing how could he have been an invalid when he did not even know what the word meant but of course his mother was right  oh well said mr stonecrop i can just let him drive through bloomsbury square and then he shall run home again  very good sir and i'm much obliged to you said his mother and diamond dancing with delight got his cap put his hand in mr stonecrop's and went with him to the yard where the cab was waiting he did not think the horse looked nearly so nice as diamond nor mr stonecrop nearly so grand as his father but he was none the less pleased he got up on the box and his new friend got up beside him  what's the horse's name whispered diamond as he took the reins from the man  it's not a nice name said mr stonecrop you needn't call him by it i didn't give it him he'll go well enough without it give the boy a whip jack i never carries one when i drive old    he didn't finish the sentence jack handed diamond a whip with which by holding it half down the stick he managed just to flack the haunches of the horse and away he went  mind the gate said mr stonecrop and diamond did mind the gate and guided the nameless horse through it in safety pulling him this way and that according as was necessary diamond learned to drive all the sooner that he had been accustomed to do what he was told and could obey the smallest hint in a moment nothing helps one to get on like that some people don't know how to do what they are told they have not been used to it and they neither understand quickly nor are able to turn what they do understand into action quickly with an obedient mind one learns the rights of things fast enough for it is the law of the universe and to obey is to understand  look out cried mr stonecrop as they were turning the corner into bloomsbury square  it was getting dusky now a cab was approaching rather rapidly from the opposite direction and diamond pulling aside and the other driver pulling up they only just escaped a collision then they knew each other  why diamond it's a bad beginning to run into your own father cried the driver  but father wouldn't it have been a bad ending to run into your own son said diamond in return and the two men laughed heartily  this is very kind of you i'm sure stonecrop said his father  not a bit he's a brave fellow and'll be fit to drive on his own hook in a week or two but i think you'd better let him drive you home now for his mother don't like his having over much of the night air and i promised not to take him farther than the square  come along then diamond said his father as he brought his cab up to the other and moved off the box to the seat beside it diamond jumped across caught at the reins said good-night and thank you mr stonecrop and drove away home feeling more of a man than he had ever yet had a chance of feeling in all his life nor did his father find it necessary to give him a single hint as to his driving only i suspect the fact that it was old diamond and old diamond on his way to his stable may have had something to do with young diamond's success  well child said his mother when he entered the room you've not been long gone  no mother here i am give me the baby  the baby's asleep said his mother  then give him to me and i'll lay him down  but as diamond took him he woke up and began to laugh for he was indeed one of the merriest children and no wonder for he was as plump as a plum-pudding and had never had an ache or a pain that lasted more than five minutes at a time diamond sat down with him and began to sing to him  baby baby babbing your father's gone a-cabbing to catch a shilling for its pence to make the baby babbing dance for old diamond's a duck they say he can swim but the duck of diamonds is baby that's him and of all the swallows the merriest fellows that bake their cake with the water they shake out of the river flowing for ever and make dust into clay on the shiniest day to build their nest father's the best and mother's the whitest and her eyes are the brightest of all the dams that watch their lambs cropping the grass where the waters pass singing for ever and of all the lambs with the shakingest tails and the jumpingest feet baby's the funniest baby's the bonniest and he never wails and he's always sweet and diamond's his nurse and diamond's his nurse and diamond's his nurse   when diamond's rhymes grew scarce he always began dancing the baby some people wondered that such a child could rhyme as he did but his rhymes were not very good for he was only trying to remember what he had heard the river sing at the back of the north wind     chapter xvii diamond goes on   diamond became a great favourite with all the men about the mews some may think it was not the best place in the world for him to be brought up in but it must have been for there he was at first he heard a good many rough and bad words but he did not like them and so they did him little harm he did not know in the least what they meant but there was something in the very sound of them and in the tone of voice in which they were said which diamond felt to be ugly so they did not even stick to him not to say get inside him he never took any notice of them and his face shone pure and good in the middle of them like a primrose in a hailstorm at first because his face was so quiet and sweet with a smile always either awake or asleep in his eyes and because he never heeded their ugly words and rough jokes they said he wasn't all there meaning that he was half an idiot whereas he was a great deal more there than they had the sense to see and before long the bad words found themselves ashamed to come out of the men's mouths when diamond was near the one would nudge the other to remind him that the boy was within hearing and the words choked themselves before they got any farther when they talked to him nicely he had always a good answer sometimes a smart one ready and that helped much to make them change their minds about him  one day jack gave him a curry-comb and a brush to try his hand upon old diamond's coat he used them so deftly so gently and yet so thoroughly as far as he could reach that the man could not help admiring him  you must make haste and grow he said it won't do to have a horse's belly clean and his back dirty you know  give me a leg said diamond and in a moment he was on the old horse's back with the comb and brush he sat on his withers and reaching forward as he ate his hay he curried and he brushed first at one side of his neck and then at the other when that was done he asked for a dressing-comb and combed his mane thoroughly then he pushed himself on to his back and did his shoulders as far down as he could reach then he sat on his croup and did his back and sides then he turned around like a monkey and attacked his hind-quarters and combed his tail this last was not so easy to manage for he had to lift it up and every now and then old diamond would whisk it out of his hands and once he sent the comb flying out of the stable door to the great amusement of the men but jack fetched it again and diamond began once more and did not leave off until he had done the whole business fairly well if not in a first-rate experienced fashion all the time the old horse went on eating his hay and but with an occasional whisk of his tail when diamond tickled or scratched him took no notice of the proceeding but that was all a pretence for he knew very well who it was that was perched on his back and rubbing away at him with the comb and the brush so he was quite pleased and proud and perhaps said to himself something like this   i'm a stupid old horse who can't brush his own coat but there's my young godson on my back cleaning me like an angel  i won't vouch for what the old horse was thinking for it is very difficult to find out what any old horse is thinking  oh dear said diamond when he had done i'm so tired  and he laid himself down at full length on old diamond's back  by this time all the men in the stable were gathered about the two diamonds and all much amused one of them lifted him down and from that time he was a greater favourite than before and if ever there was a boy who had a chance of being a prodigy at cab-driving diamond was that boy for the strife came to be who should have him out with him on the box  his mother however was a little shy of the company for him and besides she could not always spare him also his father liked to have him himself when he could so that he was more desired than enjoyed among the cabmen  but one way and another he did learn to drive all sorts of horses and to drive them well and that through the most crowded streets in london city of course there was the man always on the box-seat beside him but before long there was seldom the least occasion to take the reins from out of his hands for one thing he never got frightened and consequently was never in too great a hurry yet when the moment came for doing something sharp he was always ready for it i must once more remind my readers that he had been to the back of the north wind  one day which was neither washing-day nor cleaning-day nor marketing-day nor saturday nor monday upon which consequently diamond could be spared from the baby his father took him on his own cab after a stray job or two by the way they drew up in the row upon the stand between cockspur street and pall mall they waited a long time but nobody seemed to want to be carried anywhere by and by ladies would be going home from the academy exhibition and then there would be a chance of a job  though to be sure said diamond's father with what truth i cannot say but he believed what he said some ladies is very hard and keeps you to the bare sixpence a mile when every one knows that ain't enough to keep a family and a cab upon to be sure it's the law but mayhap they may get more law than they like some day themselves  as it was very hot diamond's father got down to have a glass of beer himself and give another to the old waterman he left diamond on the box  a sudden noise got up and diamond looked round to see what was the matter  there was a crossing near the cab-stand where a girl was sweeping some rough young imps had picked a quarrel with her and were now hauling at her broom to get it away from her but as they did not pull all together she was holding it against them scolding and entreating alternately  diamond was off his box in a moment and running to the help of the girl he got hold of the broom at her end and pulled along with her but the boys proceeded to rougher measures and one of them hit diamond on the nose and made it bleed and as he could not let go the broom to mind his nose he was soon a dreadful figure but presently his father came back and missing diamond looked about he had to look twice however before he could be sure that that was his boy in the middle of the tumult he rushed in and sent the assailants flying in all directions the girl thanked diamond and began sweeping as if nothing had happened while his father led him away with the help of old tom the waterman he was soon washed into decency and his father set him on the box again perfectly satisfied with the account he gave of the cause of his being in a fray  i couldn't let them behave so to a poor girl could i father he said  certainly not diamond said his father quite pleased for diamond's father was a gentleman  a moment after up came the girl running with her broom over her shoulder and calling cab there cab  diamond's father turned instantly for he was the foremost in the rank and followed the girl one or two other passing cabs heard the cry and made for the place but the girl had taken care not to call till she was near enough to give her friends the first chance when they reached the curbstone who should it be waiting for the cab but mrs and miss coleman they did not look at the cabman however the girl opened the door for them they gave her the address and a penny she told the cabman and away they drove  when they reached the house diamond's father got down and rang the bell as he opened the door of the cab he touched his hat as he had been wont to do the ladies both stared for a moment and then exclaimed together   why joseph can it be you  yes ma'am yes miss answered he again touching his hat with all the respect he could possibly put into the action it's a lucky day which i see you once more upon it  who would have thought it said mrs coleman it's changed times for both of us joseph and it's not very often we can have a cab even but you see my daughter is still very poorly and she can't bear the motion of the omnibuses indeed we meant to walk a bit first before we took a cab but just at the corner for as hot as the sun was a cold wind came down the street and i saw that miss coleman must not face it but to think we should have fallen upon you of all the cabmen in london i didn't know you had got a cab  well you see ma'am i had a chance of buying the old horse and i couldn't resist him there he is looking at you ma'am nobody knows the sense in that head of his  the two ladies went near to pat the horse and then they noticed diamond on the box  why you've got both diamonds with you said miss coleman how do you do diamond  diamond lifted his cap and answered politely  he'll be fit to drive himself before long said his father proudly the old horse is a-teaching of him  well he must come and see us now you've found us out where do you live  diamond's father gave the ladies a ticket with his name and address printed on it and then mrs coleman took out her purse saying   and what's your fare joseph  no thank you ma'am said joseph it was your own old horse as took you and me you paid long ago  he jumped on his box before she could say another word and with a parting salute drove off leaving them on the pavement with the maid holding the door for them  it was a long time now since diamond had seen north wind or even thought much about her and as his father drove along he was thinking not about her but about the crossing-sweeper and was wondering what made him feel as if he knew her quite well when he could not remember anything of her but a picture arose in his mind of a little girl running before the wind and dragging her broom after her and from that by degrees he recalled the whole adventure of the night when he got down from north wind's back in a london street but he could not quite satisfy himself whether the whole affair was not a dream which he had dreamed when he was a very little boy only he had been to the back of the north wind since there could be no doubt of that for when he woke every morning he always knew that he had been there again and as he thought and thought he recalled another thing that had happened that morning which although it seemed a mere accident might have something to do with what had happened since his father had intended going on the stand at king's cross that morning and had turned into gray's inn lane to drive there when they found the way blocked up and upon inquiry were informed that a stack of chimneys had been blown down in the night and had fallen across the road they were just clearing the rubbish away diamond's father turned and made for charing cross  that night the father and mother had a great deal to talk about  poor things said the mother it's worse for them than it is for us you see they've been used to such grand things and for them to come down to a little poky house like that it breaks my heart to think of it  i don't know said diamond thoughtfully whether mrs coleman had bells on her toes  what do you mean child said his mother  she had rings on her fingers anyhow returned diamond  of course she had as any lady would what has that to do with it  when we were down at sandwich said diamond you said you would have to part with your mother's ring now we were poor  bless the child he forgets nothing said his mother really diamond a body would need to mind what they say to you  why said diamond i only think about it  that's just why said the mother  why is that why persisted diamond for he had not yet learned that grown-up people are not often so much grown up that they never talk like children and spoilt ones too  mrs coleman is none so poor as all that yet no thank heaven she's not come to that  is it a great disgrace to be poor asked diamond because of the tone in which his mother had spoken  but his mother whether conscience-stricken i do not know hurried him away to bed where after various attempts to understand her resumed and resumed again in spite of invading sleep he was conquered at last and gave in murmuring over and over to himself why is why but getting no answer to the question     chapter xviii the drunken cabman   a few nights after this diamond woke up suddenly believing he heard north wind thundering along but it was something quite different south wind was moaning round the chimneys to be sure for she was not very happy that night but it was not her voice that had wakened diamond her voice would only have lulled him the deeper asleep it was a loud angry voice now growling like that of a beast now raving like that of a madman and when diamond came a little wider awake he knew that it was the voice of the drunken cabman the wall of whose room was at the head of his bed it was anything but pleasant to hear but he could not help hearing it at length there came a cry from the woman and then a scream from the baby thereupon diamond thought it time that somebody did something and as himself was the only somebody at hand he must go and see whether he could not do something so he got up and put on part of his clothes and went down the stair for the cabman's room did not open upon their stair and he had to go out into the yard and in at the next door this fortunately the cabman being drunk had left open by the time he reached their stair all was still except the voice of the crying baby which guided him to the right door he opened it softly and peeped in there leaning back in a chair with his arms hanging down by his sides and his legs stretched out before him and supported on his heels sat the drunken cabman his wife lay in her clothes upon the bed sobbing and the baby was wailing in the cradle it was very miserable altogether  now the way most people do when they see anything very miserable is to turn away from the sight and try to forget it but diamond began as usual to try to destroy the misery the little boy was just as much one of god's messengers as if he had been an angel with a flaming sword going out to fight the devil the devil he had to fight just then was misery and the way he fought him was the very best like a wise soldier he attacked him first in his weakest point that was the baby for misery can never get such a hold of a baby as of a grown person diamond was knowing in babies and he knew he could do something to make the baby happy for although he had only known one baby as yet and although not one baby is the same as another yet they are so very much alike in some things and he knew that one baby so thoroughly that he had good reason to believe he could do something for any other i have known people who would have begun to fight the devil in a very different and a very stupid way they would have begun by scolding the idiotic cabman and next they would make his wife angry by saying it must be her fault as well as his and by leaving ill-bred though well-meant shabby little books for them to read which they were sure to hate the sight of while all the time they would not have put out a finger to touch the wailing baby but diamond had him out of the cradle in a moment set him up on his knee and told him to look at the light now all the light there was came only from a lamp in the yard and it was a very dingy and yellow light for the glass of the lamp was dirty and the gas was bad but the light that came from it was notwithstanding as certainly light as if it had come from the sun itself and the baby knew that and smiled to it and although it was indeed a wretched room which that lamp lighted so dreary and dirty and empty and hopeless there in the middle of it sat diamond on a stool smiling to the baby and the baby on his knees smiling to the lamp the father of him sat staring at nothing neither asleep nor awake not quite lost in stupidity either for through it all he was dimly angry with himself he did not know why it was that he had struck his wife he had forgotten it but was miserable about it notwithstanding and this misery was the voice of the great love that had made him and his wife and the baby and diamond speaking in his heart and telling him to be good for that great love speaks in the most wretched and dirty hearts only the tone of its voice depends on the echoes of the place in which it sounds on mount sinai it was thunder in the cabman's heart it was misery in the soul of st john it was perfect blessedness  by and by he became aware that there was a voice of singing in the room this of course was the voice of diamond singing to the baby song after song every one as foolish as another to the cabman for he was too tipsy to part one word from another  all the words mixed up in his ear in a gurgle without division or stop for such was the way he spoke himself when he was in this horrid condition but the baby was more than content with diamond's songs and diamond himself was so contented with what the songs were all about that he did not care a bit about the songs themselves if only baby liked them but they did the cabman good as well as the baby and diamond for they put him to sleep and the sleep was busy all the time it lasted smoothing the wrinkles out of his temper  at length diamond grew tired of singing and began to talk to the baby instead and as soon as he stopped singing the cabman began to wake up his brain was a little clearer now his temper a little smoother and his heart not quite so dirty he began to listen and he went on listening and heard diamond saying to the baby something like this for he thought the cabman was asleep   poor daddy baby's daddy takes too much beer and gin and that makes him somebody else and not his own self at all baby's daddy would never hit baby's mammy if he didn't take too much beer he's very fond of baby's mammy and works from morning to night to get her breakfast and dinner and supper only at night he forgets and pays the money away for beer and they put nasty stuff in beer i've heard my daddy say that drives all the good out and lets all the bad in daddy says when a man takes a drink there's a thirsty devil creeps into his inside because he knows he will always get enough there and the devil is always crying out for more drink and that makes the man thirsty and so he drinks more and more till he kills himself with it and then the ugly devil creeps out of him and crawls about on his belly looking for some other cabman to get into that he may drink drink drink that's what my daddy says baby and he says too the only way to make the devil come out is to give him plenty of cold water and tea and coffee and nothing at all that comes from the public-house for the devil can't abide that kind of stuff and creeps out pretty soon for fear of being drowned in it but your daddy will drink the nasty stuff poor man i wish he wouldn't for it makes mammy cross with him and no wonder and then when mammy's cross he's crosser and there's nobody in the house to take care of them but baby and you do take care of them baby don't you baby i know you do babies always take care of their fathers and mothers don't they baby that's what they come for isn't it baby and when daddy stops drinking beer and nasty gin with turpentine in it father says then mammy will be so happy and look so pretty and daddy will be so good to baby and baby will be as happy as a swallow which is the merriest fellow and diamond will be so happy too and when diamond's a man he'll take baby out with him on the box and teach him to drive a cab  he went on with chatter like this till baby was asleep by which time he was tired and father and mother were both wide awake only rather confused the one from the beer the other from the blow and staring the one from his chair the other from her bed at diamond but he was quite unaware of their notice for he sat half-asleep with his eyes wide open staring in his turn though without knowing it at the cabman while the cabman could not withdraw his gaze from diamond's white face and big eyes for diamond's face was always rather pale and now it was paler than usual with sleeplessness and the light of the street-lamp upon it at length he found himself nodding and he knew then it was time to put the baby down lest he should let him fall so he rose from the little three-legged stool and laid the baby in the cradle and covered him up it was well it was a warm night and he did not want much covering and then he all but staggered out of the door he was so tipsy himself with sleep  wife said the cabman turning towards the bed i do somehow believe that wur a angel just gone did you see him wife he warn't wery big and he hadn't got none o' them wingses you know it wur one o' them baby-angels you sees on the gravestones you know  nonsense hubby said his wife but it's just as good i might say better for you can ketch hold of him when you like that's little diamond as everybody knows and a duck o' diamonds he is no woman could wish for a better child than he be  i ha' heerd on him in the stable but i never see the brat afore come old girl let bygones be bygones and gie us a kiss and we'll go to bed  the cabman kept his cab in another yard although he had his room in this he was often late in coming home and was not one to take notice of children especially when he was tipsy which was oftener than not hence if he had ever seen diamond he did not know him but his wife knew him well enough as did every one else who lived all day in the yard she was a good-natured woman it was she who had got the fire lighted and the tea ready for them when diamond and his mother came home from sandwich and her husband was not an ill-natured man either and when in the morning he recalled not only diamond's visit but how he himself had behaved to his wife he was very vexed with himself and gladdened his poor wife's heart by telling her how sorry he was and for a whole week after he did not go near the public-house hard as it was to avoid it seeing a certain rich brewer had built one like a trap to catch souls and bodies in at almost every corner he had to pass on his way home indeed he was never quite so bad after that though it was some time before he began really to reform     chapter xix diamond's friends   one day when old diamond was standing with his nose in his bag between pall mall and cockspur street and his master was reading the newspaper on the box of his cab which was the last of a good many in the row little diamond got down for a run for his legs were getting cramped with sitting and first of all he strolled with his hands in his pockets up to the crossing where the girl and her broom were to be found in all weathers just as he was going to speak to her a tall gentleman stepped upon the crossing he was pleased to find it so clean for the streets were muddy and he had nice boots on so he put his hand in his pocket and gave the girl a penny but when she gave him a sweet smile in return and made him a pretty courtesy he looked at her again and said   where do you live my child  paradise row she answered next door to the adam and eve down the area  whom do you live with he asked  my wicked old grannie she replied  you shouldn't call your grannie wicked said the gentleman  but she is said the girl looking up confidently in his face if you don't believe me you can come and take a look at her  the words sounded rude but the girl's face looked so simple that the gentleman saw she did not mean to be rude and became still more interested in her  still you shouldn't say so he insisted  shouldn't i everybody calls her wicked old grannie even them that's as wicked as her you should hear her swear there's nothing like it in the row indeed i assure you sir there's ne'er a one of them can shut my grannie up once she begins and gets right a-going you must put her in a passion first you know it's no good till you do that she's so old now how she do make them laugh to be sure  although she called her wicked the child spoke so as plainly to indicate pride in her grannie's pre-eminence in swearing  the gentleman looked very grave to hear her for he was sorry that such a nice little girl should be in such bad keeping but he did not know what to say next and stood for a moment with his eyes on the ground when he lifted them he saw the face of diamond looking up in his  please sir said diamond her grannie's very cruel to her sometimes and shuts her out in the streets at night if she happens to be late  is this your brother asked the gentleman of the girl  no sir  how does he know your grandmother then he does not look like one of her sort  oh no sir he's a good boy quite  here she tapped her forehead with her finger in a significant manner  what do you mean by that asked the gentleman while diamond looked on smiling  the cabbies call him god's baby she whispered he's not right in the head you know a tile loose  still diamond though he heard every word and understood it too kept on smiling what could it matter what people called him so long as he did nothing he ought not to do and besides god's baby was surely the best of names  well my little man and what can you do asked the gentleman turning towards him just for the sake of saying something  drive a cab said diamond  good and what else he continued for accepting what the girl had said he regarded the still sweetness of diamond's face as a sign of silliness and wished to be kind to the poor little fellow  nurse a baby said diamond  well and what else  clean father's boots and make him a bit of toast for his tea  you're a useful little man said the gentleman what else can you do  not much that i know of said diamond i can't curry a horse except somebody puts me on his back so i don't count that  can you read  no but mother can and father can and they're going to teach me some day soon  well here's a penny for you  thank you sir  and when you have learned to read come to me and i'll give you sixpence and a book with fine pictures in it  please sir where am i to come asked diamond who was too much a man of the world not to know that he must have the gentleman's address before he could go and see him  you're no such silly thought he as he put his hand in his pocket and brought out a card there he said your father will be able to read that and tell you where to go  yes sir thank you sir said diamond and put the card in his pocket  the gentleman walked away but turning round a few paces off saw diamond give his penny to the girl and walking slower heard him say   i've got a father and mother and little brother and you've got nothing but a wicked old grannie you may have my penny  the girl put it beside the other in her pocket the only trustworthy article of dress she wore her grandmother always took care that she had a stout pocket  is she as cruel as ever asked diamond  much the same but i gets more coppers now than i used to and i can get summats to eat and take browns enough home besides to keep her from grumbling it's a good thing she's so blind though  why asked diamond  'cause if she was as sharp in the eyes as she used to be she would find out i never eats her broken wittles and then she'd know as i must get something somewheres  doesn't she watch you then  o' course she do don't she just but i make believe and drop it in my lap and then hitch it into my pocket  what would she do if she found you out  she never give me no more  but you don't want it  yes i do want it  what do you do with it then  give it to cripple jim  who's cripple jim  a boy in the row his mother broke his leg when he wur a kid so he's never come to much but he's a good boy is jim and i love jim dearly i always keeps off a penny for jim leastways as often as i can but there i must sweep again for them busses makes no end o' dirt  diamond diamond cried his father who was afraid he might get no good by talking to the girl and diamond obeyed and got up again upon the box he told his father about the gentleman and what he had promised him if he would learn to read and showed him the gentleman's card  why it's not many doors from the mews said his father giving him back the card take care of it my boy for it may lead to something god knows in these hard times a man wants as many friends as he's ever likely to get  haven't you got friends enough father asked diamond  well i have no right to complain but the more the better you know  just let me count said diamond  and he took his hands from his pockets and spreading out the fingers of his left hand began to count beginning at the thumb  there's mother first and then baby and then me next there's old diamond and the cab no i won't count the cab for it never looks at you and when diamond's out of the shafts it's nobody then there's the man that drinks next door and his wife and his baby  they're no friends of mine said his father  well they're friends of mine said diamond  his father laughed  much good they'll do you he said  how do you know they won't returned diamond  well go on said his father  then there's jack and mr stonecrop and deary me not to have mentioned mr coleman and mrs coleman and miss coleman and mrs crump and then there's the clergyman that spoke to me in the garden that day the tree was blown down  what's his name  i don't know his name  where does he live  i don't know  how can you count him then  he did talk to me and very kindlike too  his father laughed again  why child you're just counting everybody you know that don't make 'em friends  don't it i thought it did well but they shall be my friends i shall make 'em  how will you do that  they can't help themselves then if they would if i choose to be their friend you know they can't prevent me then there's that girl at the crossing  a fine set of friends you do have to be sure diamond  surely she's a friend anyhow father if it hadn't been for her you would never have got mrs coleman and miss coleman to carry home  his father was silent for he saw that diamond was right and was ashamed to find himself more ungrateful than he had thought  then there's the new gentleman diamond went on  if he do as he say interposed his father  and why shouldn't he i daresay sixpence ain't too much for him to spare but i don't quite understand father  is nobody your friend but the one that does something for you  no i won't say that my boy you would have to leave out baby then  oh no i shouldn't baby can laugh in your face and crow in your ears and make you feel so happy call you that nothing father  the father's heart was fairly touched now he made no answer to this last appeal and diamond ended off with saying   and there's the best of mine to come yet and that's you daddy except it be mother you know you're my friend daddy ain't you and i'm your friend ain't i  and god for us all said his father and then they were both silent for that was very solemn     chapter xx diamond learns to read   the question of the tall gentleman as to whether diamond could read or not set his father thinking it was high time he could and as soon as old diamond was suppered and bedded he began the task that very night but it was not much of a task to diamond for his father took for his lesson-book those very rhymes his mother had picked up on the sea-shore and as diamond was not beginning too soon he learned very fast indeed within a month he was able to spell out most of the verses for himself  but he had never come upon the poem he thought he had heard his mother read from it that day he had looked through and through the book several times after he knew the letters and a few words fancying he could tell the look of it but had always failed to find one more like it than another so he wisely gave up the search till he could really read then he resolved to begin at the beginning and read them all straight through this took him nearly a fortnight when he had almost reached the end he came upon the following verses which took his fancy much although they were certainly not very like those he was in search of   little boy blue              little boy blue lost his way in a wood                sing apples and cherries roses and honey             he said i would not go back if i could                it's all so jolly and funny              he sang this wood is all my own                apples and cherries roses and honey             so here i'll sit like a king on my throne                all so jolly and funny              a little snake crept out of the tree                apples and cherries roses and honey             lie down at my feet little snake said he                all so jolly and funny              a little bird sang in the tree overhead                apples and cherries roses and honey             come and sing your song on my finger instead                all so jolly and funny              the snake coiled up and the bird flew down             and sang him the song of birdie brown              little boy blue found it tiresome to sit             and he thought he had better walk on a bit              so up he got his way to take             and he said come along little bird and snake              and waves of snake o'er the damp leaves passed             and the snake went first and birdie brown last              by boy blue's head with flutter and dart             flew birdie brown with its song in its heart              he came where the apples grew red and sweet              tree drop me an apple down at my feet              he came where the cherries hung plump and red              come to my mouth sweet kisses he said              and the boughs bow down and the apples they dapple             the grass too many for him to grapple              and the cheeriest cherries with never a miss             fall to his mouth each a full-grown kiss              he met a little brook singing a song             he said little brook you are going wrong              you must follow me follow me follow i say             do as i tell you and come this way              and the song-singing sing-songing forest brook             leaped from its bed and after him took              followed him followed  and pale and wan             the dead leaves rustled as the water ran              and every bird high up on the bough             and every creature low down below              he called and the creatures obeyed the call             took their legs and their wings and followed him all              squirrels that carried their tails like a sack             each on his own little humpy brown back              householder snails and slugs all tails             and butterflies flutterbies ships all sails              and weasels and ousels and mice and larks             and owls and rere-mice and harkydarks              all went running and creeping and flowing             after the merry boy fluttering and going              the dappled fawns fawning the fallow-deer following             the swallows and flies flying and swallowing              cockchafers henchafers cockioli-birds             cockroaches henroaches cuckoos in herds              the spider forgot and followed him spinning             and lost all his thread from end to beginning              the gay wasp forgot his rings and his waist             he never had made such undignified haste              the dragon-flies melted to mist with their hurrying             the mole in his moleskins left his barrowing burrowing              the bees went buzzing so busy and beesy             and the midges in columns so upright and easy              but little boy blue was not content             calling for followers still as he went              blowing his horn and beating his drum             and crying aloud come all of you come              he said to the shadows come after me              and the shadows began to flicker and flee              and they flew through the wood all flattering and fluttering             over the dead leaves flickering and muttering              and he said to the wind come follow come follow             with whistle and pipe and rustle and hollo              and the wind wound round at his desire             as if he had been the gold cock on the spire              and the cock itself flew down from the church             and left the farmers all in the lurch              they run and they fly they creep and they come             everything everything all and some              the very trees they tugged at their roots             only their feet were too fast in their boots              after him leaning and straining and bending             as on through their boles he kept walking and wending              till out of the wood he burst on a lea             shouting and calling come after me              and then they rose up with a leafy hiss             and stood as if nothing had been amiss              little boy blue sat down on a stone             and the creatures came round him every one              and he said to the clouds i want you there              and down they sank through the thin blue air              and he said to the sunset far in the west             come here i want you i know best              and the sunset came and stood up on the wold             and burned and glowed in purple and gold              then little boy blue began to ponder              what's to be done with them all i wonder              then little boy blue he said quite low             what to do with you all i am sure i don't know              then the clouds clodded down till dismal it grew             the snake sneaked close round birdie brown flew              the brook sat up like a snake on its tail             and the wind came up with a what-will-you wail              and all the creatures sat and stared             the mole opened his very eyes and glared              and for rats and bats and the world and his wife             little boy blue was afraid of his life              then birdie brown began to sing             and what he sang was the very thing               you have brought us all hither little boy blue             pray what do you want us all to do              go away  go away said little boy blue             i'm sure i don't want you get away do              no no no no no yes and no no              sang birdie brown it mustn't be so              we cannot for nothing come here and away             give us some work or else we stay              oh dear and oh dear with sob and with sigh             said little boy blue and began to cry              but before he got far he thought of a thing             and up he stood and spoke like a king              why do you hustle and jostle and bother             off with you all  take me back to my mother              the sunset stood at the gates of the west             follow me follow me came from birdie brown's breast              i am going that way as fast as i can              said the brook as it sank and turned and ran              back to the woods fled the shadows like ghosts              if we stay we shall all be missed from our posts              said the wind with a voice that had changed its cheer             i was just going there when you brought me here              that's where i live said the sack-backed squirrel             and he turned his sack with a swing and a swirl              said the cock of the spire his father's churchwarden              said the brook running faster i run through his garden              said the mole two hundred worms there i caught 'em             last year and i'm going again next autumn              said they all if that's where you want us to steer for             what in earth or in water did you bring us here for              never you mind said little boy blue             that's what i tell you  if that you won't do              i'll get up at once and go home without you             i think i will i begin to doubt you              he rose and up rose the snake on its tail             and hissed three times half a hiss half a wail              little boy blue he tried to go past him             but wherever he turned sat the snake and faced him              if you don't get out of my way he said             i tell you snake i will break your head              the snake he neither would go nor come             so he hit him hard with the stick of his drum              the snake fell down as if he were dead             and little boy blue set his foot on his head              and all the creatures they marched before him             and marshalled him home with a high cockolorum              and birdie brown sang twirrrr twitter twirrrr twee              apples and cherries roses and honey             little boy blue has listened to me              all so jolly and funny     chapter xxi sal's nanny   diamond managed with many blunders to read this rhyme to his mother  isn't it nice mother he said  yes it's pretty she answered  i think it means something returned diamond  i'm sure i don't know what she said  i wonder if it's the same boy yes it must be the same little boy blue you know let me see how does that rhyme go  little boy blue come blow me your horn   yes of course it is for this one went `blowing his horn and beating his drum' he had a drum too              little boy blue come blow me your horn             the sheep's in the meadow the cow's in the corn  he had to keep them out you know but he wasn't minding his work it goes               where's the little boy that looks after the sheep             he's under the haystack fast asleep  there you see mother and then let me see               who'll go and wake him  no not i             for if i do he'll be sure to cry  so i suppose nobody did wake him he was a rather cross little boy i daresay when woke up and when he did wake of himself and saw the mischief the cow had done to the corn instead of running home to his mother he ran away into the wood and lost himself don't you think that's very likely mother  i shouldn't wonder she answered  so you see he was naughty for even when he lost himself he did not want to go home any of the creatures would have shown him the way if he had asked it all but the snake he followed the snake you know and he took him farther away i suppose it was a young one of the same serpent that tempted adam and eve father was telling us about it last sunday you remember  bless the child said his mother to herself and then added aloud finding that diamond did not go on well what next  i don't know mother i'm sure there's a great deal more but what it is i can't say i only know that he killed the snake i suppose that's what he had a drumstick for he couldn't do it with his horn  but surely you're not such a silly as to take it all for true diamond  i think it must be it looks true that killing of the snake looks true it's what i've got to do so often  his mother looked uneasy diamond smiled full in her face and added   when baby cries and won't be happy and when father and you talk about your troubles i mean  this did little to reassure his mother and lest my reader should have his qualms about it too i venture to remind him once more that diamond had been to the back of the north wind  finding she made no reply diamond went on   in a week or so i shall be able to go to the tall gentleman and tell him i can read and i'll ask him if he can help me to understand the rhyme  but before the week was out he had another reason for going to mr raymond  for three days on each of which at one time or other diamond's father was on the same stand near the national gallery the girl was not at her crossing and diamond got quite anxious about her fearing she must be ill on the fourth day not seeing her yet he said to his father who had that moment shut the door of his cab upon a fare   father i want to go and look after the girl she can't be well  all right said his father only take care of yourself diamond  so saying he climbed on his box and drove off  he had great confidence in his boy you see and would trust him anywhere but if he had known the kind of place in which the girl lived he would perhaps have thought twice before he allowed him to go alone diamond who did know something of it had not however any fear from talking to the girl he had a good notion of where about it was and he remembered the address well enough so by asking his way some twenty times mostly of policemen he came at length pretty near the place the last policeman he questioned looked down upon him from the summit of six feet two inches and replied with another question but kindly   what do you want there my small kid it ain't where you was bred i guess  no sir answered diamond i live in bloomsbury  that's a long way off said the policeman  yes it's a good distance answered diamond but i find my way about pretty well policemen are always kind to me  but what on earth do you want here  diamond told him plainly what he was about and of course the man believed him for nobody ever disbelieved diamond people might think he was mistaken but they never thought he was telling a story  it's an ugly place said the policeman  is it far off asked diamond  no it's next door almost but it's not safe  nobody hurts me said diamond  i must go with you i suppose  oh no please not said diamond they might think i was going to meddle with them and i ain't you know  well do as you please said the man and gave him full directions  diamond set off never suspecting that the policeman who was a kind-hearted man with children of his own was following him close and watching him round every corner as he went on all at once he thought he remembered the place and whether it really was so or only that he had laid up the policeman's instructions well in his mind he went straight for the cellar of old sal  he's a sharp little kid anyhow for as simple as he looks said the man to himself not a wrong turn does he take but old sal's a rum un for such a child to pay a morning visit to she's worse when she's sober than when she's half drunk i've seen her when she'd have torn him in pieces  happily then for diamond old sal had gone out to get some gin when he came to her door at the bottom of the area-stair and knocked he received no answer he laid his ear to the door and thought he heard a moaning within so he tried the door and found it was not locked it was a dreary place indeed and very dark for the window was below the level of the street and covered with mud while over the grating which kept people from falling into the area stood a chest of drawers placed there by a dealer in second-hand furniture which shut out almost all the light and the smell in the place was dreadful diamond stood still for a while for he could see next to nothing but he heard the moaning plainly enough now when he got used to the darkness he discovered his friend lying with closed eyes and a white suffering face on a heap of little better than rags in a corner of the den he went up to her and spoke but she made him no answer indeed she was not in the least aware of his presence and diamond saw that he could do nothing for her without help so taking a lump of barley-sugar from his pocket which he had bought for her as he came along and laying it beside her he left the place having already made up his mind to go and see the tall gentleman mr raymond and ask him to do something for sal's nanny as the girl was called  by the time he got up the area-steps three or four women who had seen him go down were standing together at the top waiting for him they wanted his clothes for their children but they did not follow him down lest sal should find them there the moment he appeared they laid their hands on him and all began talking at once for each wanted to get some advantage over her neighbours he told them quite quietly for he was not frightened that he had come to see what was the matter with nanny  what do you know about nanny said one of them fiercely wait till old sal comes home and you'll catch it for going prying into her house when she's out if you don't give me your jacket directly i'll go and fetch her  i can't give you my jacket said diamond it belongs to my father and mother you know it's not mine to give is it now you would not think it right to give away what wasn't yours would you now  give it away no that i wouldn't i'd keep it she said with a rough laugh but if the jacket ain't yours what right have you to keep it here cherry make haste it'll be one go apiece  they all began to tug at the jacket while diamond stooped and kept his arms bent to resist them before they had done him or the jacket any harm however suddenly they all scampered away and diamond looking in the opposite direction saw the tall policeman coming towards him  you had better have let me come with you little man he said looking down in diamond's face which was flushed with his resistance  you came just in the right time thank you returned diamond they've done me no harm  they would have if i hadn't been at hand though  yes but you were at hand you know so they couldn't  perhaps the answer was deeper in purport than either diamond or the policeman knew they walked away together diamond telling his new friend how ill poor nanny was and that he was going to let the tall gentleman know the policeman put him in the nearest way for bloomsbury and stepping out in good earnest diamond reached mr raymond's door in less than an hour when he asked if he was at home the servant in return asked what he wanted  i want to tell him something  but i can't go and trouble him with such a message as that  he told me to come to him that is when i could read and i can  how am i to know that  diamond stared with astonishment for one moment then answered   why i've just told you that's how you know it  but this man was made of coarser grain than the policeman and instead of seeing that diamond could not tell a lie he put his answer down as impudence and saying do you think i'm going to take your word for it shut the door in his face  diamond turned and sat down on the doorstep thinking with himself that the tall gentleman must either come in or come out and he was therefore in the best possible position for finding him he had not waited long before the door opened again but when he looked round it was only the servant once more  get away he said what are you doing on the doorstep  waiting for mr raymond answered diamond getting up  he's not at home  then i'll wait till he comes returned diamond sitting down again with a smile  what the man would have done next i do not know but a step sounded from the hall and when diamond looked round yet again there was the tall gentleman  who's this john he asked  i don't know sir an imperent little boy as will sit on the doorstep  please sir said diamond he told me you weren't at home and i sat down to wait for you  eh what said mr raymond john john this won't do is it a habit of yours to turn away my visitors there'll be some one else to turn away i'm afraid if i find any more of this kind of thing come in my little man i suppose you've come to claim your sixpence  no sir not that  what can't you read yet  yes i can now a little but i'll come for that next time i came to tell you about sal's nanny  who's sal's nanny  the girl at the crossing you talked to the same day  oh yes i remember what's the matter has she got run over  then diamond told him all  now mr raymond was one of the kindest men in london he sent at once to have the horse put to the brougham took diamond with him and drove to the children's hospital there he was well known to everybody for he was not only a large subscriber but he used to go and tell the children stories of an afternoon one of the doctors promised to go and find nanny and do what could be done have her brought to the hospital if possible  that same night they sent a litter for her and as she could be of no use to old sal until she was better she did not object to having her removed so she was soon lying in the fever ward for the first time in her life in a nice clean bed but she knew nothing of the whole affair she was too ill to know anything     chapter xxii mr raymond's riddle   mr raymond took diamond home with him stopping at the mews to tell his mother that he would send him back soon diamond ran in with the message himself and when he reappeared he had in his hand the torn and crumpled book which north wind had given him  ah i see said mr raymond  you are going to claim your sixpence now  i wasn't thinking of that so much as of another thing said diamond there's a rhyme in this book i can't quite understand i want you to tell me what it means if you please  i will if i can answered mr raymond you shall read it to me when we get home and then i shall see  still with a good many blunders diamond did read it after a fashion mr raymond took the little book and read it over again  now mr raymond was a poet himself and so although he had never been at the back of the north wind he was able to understand the poem pretty well but before saying anything about it he read it over aloud and diamond thought he understood it much better already  i'll tell you what i think it means he then said it means that people may have their way for a while if they like but it will get them into such troubles they'll wish they hadn't had it  i know i know said diamond like the poor cabman next door he drinks too much  just so returned mr raymond but when people want to do right things about them will try to help them only they must kill the snake you know  i was sure the snake had something to do with it cried diamond triumphantly  a good deal more talk followed and mr raymond gave diamond his sixpence  what will you do with it he asked  take it home to my mother he answered she has a teapot such a black one with a broken spout and she keeps all her money in it it ain't much but she saves it up to buy shoes for me and there's baby coming on famously and he'll want shoes soon and every sixpence is something ain't it sir  to be sure my man i hope you'll always make as good a use of your money  i hope so sir said diamond  and here's a book for you full of pictures and stories and poems i wrote it myself chiefly for the children of the hospital where i hope nanny is going i don't mean i printed it you know i made it added mr raymond wishing diamond to understand that he was the author of the book  i know what you mean i make songs myself they're awfully silly but they please baby and that's all they're meant for  couldn't you let me hear one of them now said mr raymond  no sir i couldn't i forget them as soon as i've done with them besides i couldn't make a line without baby on my knee we make them together you know they're just as much baby's as mine it's he that pulls them out of me  i suspect the child's a genius said the poet to himself and that's what makes people think him silly  now if any of my child readers want to know what a genius is shall i try to tell them or shall i not i will give them one very short answer  it means one who understands things without any other body telling him what they mean god makes a few such now and then to teach the rest of us  do you like riddles asked mr raymond turning over the leaves of his own book  i don't know what a riddle is said diamond  it's something that means something else and you've got to find out what the something else is  mr raymond liked the old-fashioned riddle best and had written a few one of which he now read              i have only one foot but thousands of toes             my one foot stands but never goes             i have many arms and they're mighty all             and hundreds of fingers large and small             from the ends of my fingers my beauty grows             i breathe with my hair and i drink with my toes             i grow bigger and bigger about the waist             and yet i am always very tight laced             none e'er saw me eat i've no mouth to bite             yet i eat all day in the full sunlight             in the summer with song i shave and quiver             but in winter i fast and groan and shiver   do you know what that means diamond he asked when he had finished  no indeed i don't answered diamond  then you can read it for yourself and think over it and see if you can find out said mr raymond giving him the book and now you had better go home to your mother when you've found the riddle you can come again  if diamond had had to find out the riddle in order to see mr raymond again i doubt if he would ever have seen him  oh then i think i hear some little reader say he could not have been a genius for a genius finds out things without being told  i answer genius finds out truths not tricks and if you do not understand that i am afraid you must be content to wait till you grow older and know more     chapter xxiii the early bird   when diamond got home he found his father at home already sitting by the fire and looking rather miserable for his head ached and he felt sick he had been doing night work of late and it had not agreed with him so he had given it up but not in time for he had taken some kind of fever the next day he was forced to keep his bed and his wife nursed him and diamond attended to the baby if he had not been ill it would have been delightful to have him at home and the first day diamond sang more songs than ever to the baby and his father listened with some pleasure but the next he could not bear even diamond's sweet voice and was very ill indeed so diamond took the baby into his own room and had no end of quiet games with him there if he did pull all his bedding on the floor it did not matter for he kept baby very quiet and made the bed himself again and slept in it with baby all the next night and many nights after  but long before his father got well his mother's savings were all but gone she did not say a word about it in the hearing of her husband lest she should distress him and one night when she could not help crying she came into diamond's room that his father might not hear her she thought diamond was asleep but he was not when he heard her sobbing he was frightened and said   is father worse mother  no diamond she answered as well as she could he's a good bit better  then what are you crying for mother  because my money is almost all gone she replied  o mammy you make me think of a little poem baby and i learned out of north wind's book to-day don't you remember how i bothered you about some of the words  yes child said his mother heedlessly thinking only of what she should do after to-morrow  diamond began and repeated the poem for he had a wonderful memory              a little bird sat on the edge of her nest                her yellow-beaks slept as sound as tops             that day she had done her very best                and had filled every one of their little crops             she had filled her own just over-full                and hence she was feeling a little dull              oh dear she sighed as she sat with her head                sunk in her chest and no neck at all             while her crop stuck out like a feather bed                turned inside out and rather small             what shall i do if things don't reform             i don't know where there's a single worm              i've had twenty to-day and the children five each                besides a few flies and some very fat spiders              no one will say i don't do as i preach                 i'm one of the best of bird-providers             but where's the use  we want a storm                 i don't know where there's a single worm              there's five in my crop said a wee wee bird                which woke at the voice of his mother's pain             i know where there's five and with the word                he tucked in his head and went off again             the folly of childhood sighed his mother             has always been my especial bother              the yellow-beaks they slept on and on                 they never had heard of the bogy to-morrow             but the mother sat outside making her moan                 she'll soon have to beg or steal or borrow             for she never can tell the night before             where she shall find one red worm more              the fact as i say was she'd had too many                she couldn't sleep and she called it virtue             motherly foresight affection any                name you may call it that will not hurt you             so it was late ere she tucked her head in             and she slept so late it was almost a sin              but the little fellow who knew of five                nor troubled his head about any more             woke very early felt quite alive                and wanted a sixth to add to his store              he pushed his mother the greedy elf             then thought he had better try for himself              when his mother awoke and had rubbed her eyes                feeling less like a bird and more like a mole             she saw him fancy with what surprise                 dragging a huge worm out of a hole             'twas of this same hero the proverb took form              'tis the early bird that catches the worm   there mother said diamond as he finished ain't it funny  i wish you were like that little bird diamond and could catch worms for yourself said his mother as she rose to go and look after her husband  diamond lay awake for a few minutes thinking what he could do to catch worms it was very little trouble to make up his mind however and still less to go to sleep after it     chapter xxiv another early bird   he got up in the morning as soon as he heard the men moving in the yard he tucked in his little brother so that he could not tumble out of bed and then went out leaving the door open so that if he should cry his mother might hear him at once when he got into the yard he found the stable-door just opened  i'm the early bird i think he said to himself i hope i shall catch the worm  he would not ask any one to help him fearing his project might meet with disapproval and opposition with great difficulty but with the help of a broken chair he brought down from his bedroom he managed to put the harness on diamond if the old horse had had the least objection to the proceeding of course he could not have done it but even when it came to the bridle he opened his mouth for the bit just as if he had been taking the apple which diamond sometimes gave him he fastened the cheek-strap very carefully just in the usual hole for fear of choking his friend or else letting the bit get amongst his teeth it was a job to get the saddle on but with the chair he managed it if old diamond had had an education in physics to equal that of the camel he would have knelt down to let him put it on his back but that was more than could be expected of him and then diamond had to creep quite under him to get hold of the girth the collar was almost the worst part of the business but there diamond could help diamond he held his head very low till his little master had got it over and turned it round and then he lifted his head and shook it on to his shoulders the yoke was rather difficult but when he had laid the traces over the horse's neck the weight was not too much for him he got him right at last and led him out of the stable  by this time there were several of the men watching him but they would not interfere they were so anxious to see how he would get over the various difficulties they followed him as far as the stable-door and there stood watching him again as he put the horse between the shafts got them up one after the other into the loops fastened the traces the belly-band the breeching and the reins  then he got his whip the moment he mounted the box the men broke into a hearty cheer of delight at his success but they would not let him go without a general inspection of the harness and although they found it right for not a buckle had to be shifted they never allowed him to do it for himself again all the time his father was ill  the cheer brought his mother to the window and there she saw her little boy setting out alone with the cab in the gray of morning she tugged at the window but it was stiff and before she could open it diamond who was in a great hurry was out of the mews and almost out of the street she called diamond diamond but there was no answer except from jack  never fear for him ma'am said jack it 'ud be only a devil as would hurt him and there ain't so many o' them as some folk 'ud have you believe a boy o' diamond's size as can 'arness a 'oss t'other diamond's size and put him to right as a trivet if he do upset the keb 'll fall on his feet ma'am  but he won't upset the cab will he jack  not he ma'am leastways he won't go for to do it  i know as much as that myself what do you mean  i mean he's a little likely to do it as the oldest man in the stable how's the gov'nor to-day ma'am  a good deal better thank you she answered closing the window in some fear lest her husband should have been made anxious by the news of diamond's expedition he knew pretty well however what his boy was capable of and although not quite easy was less anxious than his mother but as the evening drew on the anxiety of both of them increased and every sound of wheels made his father raise himself in his bed and his mother peep out of the window  diamond had resolved to go straight to the cab-stand where he was best known and never to crawl for fear of getting annoyed by idlers before he got across oxford street however he was hailed by a man who wanted to catch a train and was in too great a hurry to think about the driver having carried him to king's cross in good time and got a good fare in return he set off again in great spirits and reached the stand in safety he was the first there after all  as the men arrived they all greeted him kindly and inquired after his father  ain't you afraid of the old 'oss running away with you asked one  no he wouldn't run away with me answered diamond he knows i'm getting the shillings for father or if he did he would only run home  well you're a plucky one for all your girl's looks said the man and i wish ye luck  thank you sir said diamond i'll do what i can i came to the old place you see because i knew you would let me have my turn here  in the course of the day one man did try to cut him out but he was a stranger and the shout the rest of them raised let him see it would not do and made him so far ashamed besides that he went away crawling  once in a block a policeman came up to him and asked him for his number diamond showed him his father's badge saying with a smile   father's ill at home and so i came out with the cab there's no fear of me i can drive besides the old horse could go alone  just as well i daresay you're a pair of 'em but you are a rum 'un for a cabby ain't you now said the policeman i don't know as i ought to let you go  i ain't done nothing said diamond it's not my fault i'm no bigger i'm big enough for my age  that's where it is said the man you ain't fit  how do you know that asked diamond with his usual smile and turning his head like a little bird  why how are you to get out of this ruck now when it begins to move  just you get up on the box said diamond and i'll show you there that van's a-moving now jump up  the policeman did as diamond told him and was soon satisfied that the little fellow could drive  well he said as he got down again i don't know as i should be right to interfere good luck to you my little man  thank you sir said diamond and drove away  in a few minutes a gentleman hailed him  are you the driver of this cab he asked  yes sir said diamond showing his badge of which he was proud  you're the youngest cabman i ever saw how am i to know you won't break all my bones  i would rather break all my own said diamond but if you're afraid never mind me i shall soon get another fare  i'll risk it said the gentleman and opening the door himself he jumped in  he was going a good distance and soon found that diamond got him over the ground well now when diamond had only to go straight ahead and had not to mind so much what he was about his thoughts always turned to the riddle mr raymond had set him and this gentleman looked so clever that he fancied he must be able to read it for him he had given up all hope of finding it out for himself and he could not plague his father about it when he was ill he had thought of the answer himself but fancied it could not be the right one for to see how it all fitted required some knowledge of physiology so when he reached the end of his journey he got down very quickly and with his head just looking in at the window said as the gentleman gathered his gloves and newspapers   please sir can you tell me the meaning of a riddle  you must tell me the riddle first answered the gentleman amused  diamond repeated the riddle  oh that's easy enough he returned it's a tree  well it ain't got no mouth sure enough but how then does it eat all day long  it sucks in its food through the tiniest holes in its leaves he answered its breath is its food and it can't do it except in the daylight  thank you sir thank you returned diamond i'm sorry i couldn't find it out myself mr raymond would have been better pleased with me  but you needn't tell him any one told you  diamond gave him a stare which came from the very back of the north wind where that kind of thing is unknown  that would be cheating he said at last  ain't you a cabby then  cabbies don't cheat  don't they i am of a different opinion  i'm sure my father don't  what's your fare young innocent  well i think the distance is a good deal over three miles that's two shillings only father says sixpence a mile is too little though we can't ask for more  you're a deep one but i think you're wrong it's over four miles not much but it is  then that's half-a-crown said diamond  well here's three shillings will that do  thank you kindly sir i'll tell my father how good you were to me first to tell me my riddle then to put me right about the distance and then to give me sixpence over it'll help father to get well again it will  i hope it may my man i shouldn't wonder if you're as good as you look after all  as diamond returned he drew up at a stand he had never been on before  it was time to give diamond his bag of chopped beans and oats the men got about him and began to chaff him he took it all good-humouredly until one of them who was an ill-conditioned fellow began to tease old diamond by poking him roughly in the ribs and making general game of him that he could not bear and the tears came in his eyes he undid the nose-bag put it in the boot and was just going to mount and drive away when the fellow interfered and would not let him get up diamond endeavoured to persuade him and was very civil but he would have his fun out of him as he said in a few minutes a group of idle boys had assembled and diamond found himself in a very uncomfortable position another cab drew up at the stand and the driver got off and approached the assemblage  what's up here he asked and diamond knew the voice it was that of the drunken cabman  do you see this young oyster he pretends to drive a cab said his enemy  yes i do see him and i sees you too you'd better leave him alone he ain't no oyster he's a angel come down on his own business you be off or i'll be nearer you than quite agreeable  the drunken cabman was a tall stout man who did not look one to take liberties with  oh if he's a friend of yours said the other drawing back  diamond got out the nose-bag again old diamond should have his feed out now  yes he is a friend o' mine one o' the best i ever had it's a pity he ain't a friend o' yourn you'd be the better for it but it ain't no fault of hisn  when diamond went home at night he carried with him one pound one shilling and sixpence besides a few coppers extra which had followed some of the fares  his mother had got very anxious indeed so much so that she was almost afraid when she did hear the sound of his cab to go and look lest she should be yet again disappointed and should break down before her husband but there was the old horse and there was the cab all right and there was diamond in the box his pale face looking triumphant as a full moon in the twilight  when he drew up at the stable-door jack came out and after a good many friendly questions and congratulations said   you go in to your mother diamond i'll put up the old 'oss i'll take care on him he do deserve some small attention he do  thank you jack said diamond and bounded into the house and into the arms of his mother who was waiting him at the top of the stair  the poor anxious woman led him into his own room sat down on his bed took him on her lap as if he had been a baby and cried  how's father asked diamond almost afraid to ask  better my child she answered but uneasy about you my dear  didn't you tell him i was the early bird gone out to catch the worm  that was what put it in your head was it you monkey said his mother beginning to get better  that or something else answered diamond so very quietly that his mother held his head back and stared in his face  well of all the children she said and said no more  and here's my worm resumed diamond  but to see her face as he poured the shillings and sixpences and pence into her lap she burst out crying a second time and ran with the money to her husband  and how pleased he was it did him no end of good but while he was counting the coins diamond turned to baby who was lying awake in his cradle sucking his precious thumb and took him up saying   baby baby i haven't seen you for a whole year  and then he began to sing to him as usual and what he sang was this for he was too happy either to make a song of his own or to sing sense it was one out of mr raymond's book   the true story of the cat and the fiddle                 hey diddle diddle                the cat and the fiddle             he played such a merry tune                that the cow went mad                with the pleasure she had             and jumped right over the moon                but then don't you see                before that could be             the moon had come down and listened                the little dog hearkened                so loud that he barkened             there's nothing like it there isn't                 hey diddle diddle                went the cat and the fiddle             hey diddle diddle dee dee                the dog laughed at the sport                till his cough cut him short             it was hey diddle diddle oh me                and back came the cow                with a merry merry low             for she'd humbled the man in the moon                the dish got excited                the spoon was delighted             and the dish waltzed away with the spoon                 but the man in the moon                coming back too soon             from the famous town of norwich                caught up the dish                said it's just what i wish             to hold my cold plum-porridge                 gave the cow a rat-tat                flung water on the cat             and sent him away like a rocket                said o moon there you are                 got into her car             and went off with the spoon in his pocket                 hey ho  diddle diddle                the wet cat and wet fiddle             they made such a caterwauling                that the cow in a fright                stood bolt upright             bellowing now and bawling                and the dog on his tail                stretched his neck with a wail             but ho ho said the man in the moon                 no more in the south                shall i burn my mouth             for i've found a dish and a spoon     chapter xxv diamond's dream   there baby said diamond i'm so happy that i can only sing nonsense oh father think if you had been a poor man and hadn't had a cab and old diamond what should i have done  i don't know indeed what you could have done said his father from the bed  we should have all starved my precious diamond said his mother whose pride in her boy was even greater than her joy in the shillings both of them together made her heart ache for pleasure can do that as well as pain  oh no we shouldn't said diamond i could have taken nanny's crossing till she came back and then the money instead of going for old sal's gin would have gone for father's beef-tea i wonder what nanny will do when she gets well again somebody else will be sure to have taken the crossing by that time i wonder if she will fight for it and whether i shall have to help her i won't bother my head about that time enough yet hey diddle hey diddle hey diddle diddle i wonder whether mr raymond would take me to see nanny hey diddle hey diddle hey diddle diddle the baby and fiddle o mother i'm such a silly but i can't help it i wish i could think of something else but there's nothing will come into my head but hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle i wonder what the angels do when they're extra happy you know when they've been driving cabs all day and taking home the money to their mothers do you think they ever sing nonsense mother  i daresay they've got their own sort of it answered his mother else they wouldn't be like other people she was thinking more of her twenty-one shillings and sixpence and of the nice dinner she would get for her sick husband next day than of the angels and their nonsense when she said it but diamond found her answer all right  yes to be sure he replied they wouldn't be like other people if they hadn't their nonsense sometimes but it must be very pretty nonsense and not like that silly hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle i wish i could get it out of my head i wonder what the angels' nonsense is like nonsense is a very good thing ain't it mother a little of it now and then more of it for baby and not so much for grown people like cabmen and their mothers it's like the pepper and salt that goes in the soup that's it isn't it mother there's baby fast asleep oh what a nonsense baby it is to sleep so much shall i put him down mother  diamond chattered away what rose in his happy little heart ran out of his mouth and did his father and mother good when he went to bed which he did early being more tired as you may suppose than usual he was still thinking what the nonsense could be like which the angels sang when they were too happy to sing sense but before coming to any conclusion he fell fast asleep and no wonder for it must be acknowledged a difficult question  that night he had a very curious dream which i think my readers would like to have told them they would at least if they are as fond of nice dreams as i am and don't have enough of them of their own  he dreamed that he was running about in the twilight in the old garden he thought he was waiting for north wind but she did not come so he would run down to the back gate and see if she were there he ran and ran it was a good long garden out of his dream but in his dream it had grown so long and spread out so wide that the gate he wanted was nowhere he ran and ran but instead of coming to the gate found himself in a beautiful country not like any country he had ever been in before there were no trees of any size nothing bigger in fact than hawthorns which were full of may-blossom the place in which they grew was wild and dry mostly covered with grass but having patches of heath it extended on every side as far as he could see but although it was so wild yet wherever in an ordinary heath you might have expected furze bushes or holly or broom there grew roses wild and rare all kinds on every side far and near roses were glowing there too was the gum-cistus whose flowers fall every night and come again the next morning lilacs and syringas and laburnums and many shrubs besides of which he did not know the names but the roses were everywhere he wandered on and on wondering when it would come to an end it was of no use going back for there was no house to be seen anywhere but he was not frightened for you know diamond was used to things that were rather out of the way he threw himself down under a rose-bush and fell asleep  he woke not out of his dream but into it thinking he heard a child's voice calling diamond diamond he jumped up but all was still about him the rose-bushes were pouring out their odours in clouds he could see the scent like mists of the same colour as the rose issuing like a slow fountain and spreading in the air till it joined the thin rosy vapour which hung over all the wilderness but again came the voice calling him and it seemed to come from over his head he looked up but saw only the deep blue sky full of stars more brilliant however than he had seen them before and both sky and stars looked nearer to the earth  while he gazed up again he heard the cry at the same moment he saw one of the biggest stars over his head give a kind of twinkle and jump as if it went out and came in again he threw himself on his back and fixed his eyes upon it nor had he gazed long before it went out leaving something like a scar in the blue but as he went on gazing he saw a face where the star had been a merry face with bright eyes the eyes appeared not only to see diamond but to know that diamond had caught sight of them for the face withdrew the same moment again came the voice calling diamond diamond and in jumped the star to its place  diamond called as loud as he could right up into the sky   here's diamond down below you what do you want him to do  the next instant many of the stars round about that one went out and many voices shouted from the sky   come up come up we're so jolly diamond diamond  this was followed by a peal of the merriest kindliest laughter and all the stars jumped into their places again  how am i to come up shouted diamond  go round the rose-bush it's got its foot in it said the first voice  diamond got up at once and walked to the other side of the rose-bush  there he found what seemed the very opposite of what he wanted a stair down into the earth it was of turf and moss it did not seem to promise well for getting into the sky but diamond had learned to look through the look of things the voice must have meant that he was to go down this stair and down this stair diamond went without waiting to think more about it  it was such a nice stair so cool and soft all the sides as well as the steps grown with moss and grass and ferns down and down diamond went a long way until at last he heard the gurgling and splashing of a little stream nor had he gone much farther before he met it yes met it coming up the stairs to meet him running up just as naturally as if it had been doing the other thing neither was diamond in the least surprised to see it pitching itself from one step to another as it climbed towards him  he never thought it was odd and no more it was there it would have been odd here it made a merry tune as it came and its voice was like the laughter he had heard from the sky this appeared promising and he went on down and down the stair and up and up the stream till at last he came where it hurried out from under a stone and the stair stopped altogether and as the stream bubbled up the stone shook and swayed with its force and diamond thought he would try to lift it lightly it rose to his hand forced up by the stream from below and by what would have seemed an unaccountable perversion of things had he been awake threatened to come tumbling upon his head but he avoided it and when it fell got upon it he now saw that the opening through which the water came pouring in was over his head and with the help of the stone he scrambled out by it and found himself on the side of a grassy hill which rounded away from him in every direction and down which came the brook which vanished in the hole but scarcely had he noticed so much as this before a merry shouting and laughter burst upon him and a number of naked little boys came running every one eager to get to him first at the shoulders of each fluttered two little wings which were of no use for flying as they were mere buds only being made for it they could not help fluttering as if they were flying just as the foremost of the troop reached him one or two of them fell and the rest with shouts of laughter came tumbling over them till they heaped up a mound of struggling merriment one after another they extricated themselves and each as he got free threw his arms round diamond and kissed him diamond's heart was ready to melt within him from clear delight when they had all embraced him   now let us have some fun cried one and with a shout they all scampered hither and thither and played the wildest gambols on the grassy slopes they kept constantly coming back to diamond however as the centre of their enjoyment rejoicing over him as if they had found a lost playmate  there was a wind on the hillside which blew like the very embodiment of living gladness it blew into diamond's heart and made him so happy that he was forced to sit down and cry  now let's go and dig for stars said one who seemed to be the captain of the troop  they all scurried away but soon returned one after another each with a pickaxe on his shoulder and a spade in his hand as soon as they were gathered the captain led them in a straight line to another part of the hill diamond rose and followed  here is where we begin our lesson for to-night he said scatter and dig  there was no more fun each went by himself walking slowly with bent shoulders and his eyes fixed on the ground every now and then one would stop kneel down and look intently feeling with his hands and parting the grass one would get up and walk on again another spring to his feet catch eagerly at his pickaxe and strike it into the ground once and again then throw it aside snatch up his spade and commence digging at the loosened earth now one would sorrowfully shovel the earth into the hole again trample it down with his little bare white feet and walk on but another would give a joyful shout and after much tugging and loosening would draw from the hole a lump as big as his head or no bigger than his fist when the under side of it would pour such a blaze of golden or bluish light into diamond's eyes that he was quite dazzled gold and blue were the commoner colours  the jubilation was greater over red or green or purple and every time a star was dug up all the little angels dropped their tools and crowded about it shouting and dancing and fluttering their wing-buds  when they had examined it well they would kneel down one after the other and peep through the hole but they always stood back to give diamond the first look all that diamond could report however was that through the star-holes he saw a great many things and places and people he knew quite well only somehow they were different there was something marvellous about them he could not tell what every time he rose from looking through a star-hole he felt as if his heart would break for joy and he said that if he had not cried he did not know what would have become of him  as soon as all had looked the star was carefully fitted in again a little mould was strewn over it and the rest of the heap left as a sign that the star had been discovered  at length one dug up a small star of a most lovely colour a colour diamond had never seen before the moment the angel saw what it was instead of showing it about he handed it to one of his neighbours and seated himself on the edge of the hole saying   this will do for me good-bye i'm off  they crowded about him hugging and kissing him then stood back with a solemn stillness their wings lying close to their shoulders the little fellow looked round on them once with a smile and then shot himself headlong through the star-hole diamond as privileged threw himself on the ground to peep after him but he saw nothing it's no use said the captain i never saw anything more of one that went that way  his wings can't be much use said diamond concerned and fearful yet comforted by the calm looks of the rest  that's true said the captain he's lost them by this time they all do that go that way you haven't got any you see  no said diamond i never did have any  oh didn't you said the captain  some people say he added after a pause that they come again i don't know i've never found the colour i care about myself i suppose i shall some day  then they looked again at the star put it carefully into its hole danced around it and over it but solemnly and called it by the name of the finder  will you know it again asked diamond  oh yes we never forget a star that's been made a door of  then they went on with their searching and digging  diamond having neither pickaxe nor spade had the more time to think  i don't see any little girls he said at last  the captain stopped his shovelling leaned on his spade rubbed his forehead thoughtfully with his left hand the little angels were all left-handed repeated the words little girls and then as if a thought had struck him resumed his work saying   i think i know what you mean i've never seen any of them of course but i suppose that's the sort you mean i'm told but mind i don't say it is so for i don't know that when we fall asleep a troop of angels very like ourselves only quite different goes round to all the stars we have discovered and discovers them after us i suppose with our shovelling and handling we spoil them a bit and i daresay the clouds that come up from below make them smoky and dull sometimes they say mind i say they say these other angels take them out one by one and pass each round as we do and breathe over it and rub it with their white hands which are softer than ours because they don't do any pick-and-spade work and smile at it and put it in again  and that is what keeps them from growing dark  how jolly thought diamond i should like to see them at their work too when do you go to sleep he asked the captain  when we grow sleepy answered the captain they do say but mind i say they say that it is when those others what do you call them i don't know if that is their name i am only guessing that may be the sort you mean when they are on their rounds and come near any troop of us we fall asleep they live on the west side of the hill none of us have ever been to the top of it yet  even as he spoke he dropped his spade he tumbled down beside it and lay fast asleep one after the other each of the troop dropped his pickaxe or shovel from his listless hands and lay fast asleep by his work  ah thought diamond to himself with delight now the girl-angels are coming and i not being an angel shall not fall asleep like the rest and i shall see the girl-angels  but the same moment he felt himself growing sleepy he struggled hard with the invading power he put up his fingers to his eyelids and pulled them open but it was of no use he thought he saw a glimmer of pale rosy light far up the green hill and ceased to know  when he awoke all the angels were starting up wide awake too he expected to see them lift their tools but no the time for play had come they looked happier than ever and each began to sing where he stood he had not heard them sing before  now he thought i shall know what kind of nonsense the angels sing when they are merry they don't drive cabs i see but they dig for stars and they work hard enough to be merry after it  and he did hear some of the angels' nonsense for if it was all sense to them it had only just as much sense to diamond as made good nonsense of it he tried hard to set it down in his mind listening as closely as he could now to one now to another and now to all together but while they were yet singing he began to his dismay to find that he was coming awake faster and faster and as he came awake he found that for all the goodness of his memory verse after verse of the angels' nonsense vanished from it he always thought he could keep the last but as the next began he lost the one before it and at length awoke struggling to keep hold of the last verse of all he felt as if the effort to keep from forgetting that one verse of the vanishing song nearly killed him and yet by the time he was wide awake he could not be sure of that even it was something like this             white hands of whiteness            wash the stars' faces          till glitter glitter glit goes their brightness            down to poor places   this however was so near sense that he thought it could not be really what they did sing     chapter xxvi diamond takes a fare the wrong way right   the next morning diamond was up almost as early as before he had nothing to fear from his mother now and made no secret of what he was about by the time he reached the stable several of the men were there they asked him a good many questions as to his luck the day before and he told them all they wanted to know but when he proceeded to harness the old horse they pushed him aside with rough kindness called him a baby and began to do it all for him so diamond ran in and had another mouthful of tea and bread and butter and although he had never been so tired as he was the night before he started quite fresh this morning it was a cloudy day and the wind blew hard from the north so hard sometimes that perched on the box with just his toes touching the ground diamond wished that he had some kind of strap to fasten himself down with lest he should be blown away but he did not really mind it  his head was full of the dream he had dreamed but it did not make him neglect his work for his work was not to dig stars but to drive old diamond and pick up fares there are not many people who can think about beautiful things and do common work at the same time but then there are not many people who have been to the back of the north wind  there was not much business doing and diamond felt rather cold notwithstanding his mother had herself put on his comforter and helped him with his greatcoat but he was too well aware of his dignity to get inside his cab as some do a cabman ought to be above minding the weather at least so diamond thought at length he was called to a neighbouring house where a young woman with a heavy box had to be taken to wapping for a coast-steamer  he did not find it at all pleasant so far east and so near the river for the roughs were in great force however there being no block not even in nightingale lane he reached the entrance of the wharf and set down his passenger without annoyance but as he turned to go back some idlers not content with chaffing him showed a mind to the fare the young woman had given him they were just pulling him off the box and diamond was shouting for the police when a pale-faced man in very shabby clothes but with the look of a gentleman somewhere about him came up and making good use of his stick drove them off  now my little man he said get on while you can don't lose any time this is not a place for you  but diamond was not in the habit of thinking only of himself he saw that his new friend looked weary if not ill and very poor  won't you jump in sir he said i will take you wherever you like  thank you my man but i have no money so i can't  oh i don't want any money i shall be much happier if you will get in you have saved me all i had i owe you a lift sir  which way are you going  to charing cross but i don't mind where i go  well i am very tired if you will take me to charing cross i shall be greatly obliged to you i have walked from gravesend and had hardly a penny left to get through the tunnel  so saying he opened the door and got in and diamond drove away  but as he drove he could not help fancying he had seen the gentleman for diamond knew he was a gentleman before do all he could however he could not recall where or when meantime his fare if we may call him such seeing he was to pay nothing whom the relief of being carried had made less and less inclined to carry himself had been turning over things in his mind and as they passed the mint called to diamond who stopped the horse got down and went to the window  if you didn't mind taking me to chiswick i should be able to pay you when we got there it's a long way but you shall have the whole fare from the docks and something over  very well sir said diamond i shall be most happy  he was just clambering up again when the gentleman put his head out of the window and said   it's the wilderness mr coleman's place but i'll direct you when we come into the neighbourhood  it flashed upon diamond who he was but he got upon his box to arrange his thoughts before making any reply  the gentleman was mr evans to whom miss coleman was to have been married and diamond had seen him several times with her in the garden i have said that he had not behaved very well to miss coleman he had put off their marriage more than once in a cowardly fashion merely because he was ashamed to marry upon a small income and live in a humble way when a man thinks of what people will say in such a case he may love but his love is but a poor affair mr coleman took him into the firm as a junior partner and it was in a measure through his influence that he entered upon those speculations which ruined him so his love had not been a blessing the ship which north wind had sunk was their last venture and mr evans had gone out with it in the hope of turning its cargo to the best advantage he was one of the single boat-load which managed to reach a desert island and he had gone through a great many hardships and sufferings since then but he was not past being taught and his troubles had done him no end of good for they had made him doubt himself and begin to think so that he had come to see that he had been foolish as well as wicked for if he had had miss coleman with him in the desert island to build her a hut and hunt for her food and make clothes for her he would have thought himself the most fortunate of men and when he was at home he would not marry till he could afford a man-servant before he got home again he had even begun to understand that no man can make haste to be rich without going against the will of god in which case it is the one frightful thing to be successful so he had come back a more humble man and longing to ask miss coleman to forgive him but he had no idea what ruin had fallen upon them for he had never made himself thoroughly acquainted with the firm's affairs few speculative people do know their own affairs hence he never doubted he should find matters much as he left them and expected to see them all at the wilderness as before but if he had not fallen in with diamond he would not have thought of going there first  what was diamond to do he had heard his father and mother drop some remarks concerning mr evans which made him doubtful of him he understood that he had not been so considerate as he might have been so he went rather slowly till he should make up his mind it was of course of no use to drive mr evans to chiswick but if he should tell him what had befallen them and where they lived now he might put off going to see them and he was certain that miss coleman at least must want very much to see mr evans he was pretty sure also that the best thing in any case was to bring them together and let them set matters right for themselves  the moment he came to this conclusion he changed his course from westward to northward and went straight for mr coleman's poor little house in hoxton mr evans was too tired and too much occupied with his thoughts to take the least notice of the streets they passed through and had no suspicion therefore of the change of direction  by this time the wind had increased almost to a hurricane and as they had often to head it it was no joke for either of the diamonds the distance however was not great before they reached the street where mr coleman lived it blew so tremendously that when miss coleman who was going out a little way opened the door it dashed against the wall with such a bang that she was afraid to venture and went in again in five minutes after diamond drew up at the door as soon as he had entered the street however the wind blew right behind them and when he pulled up old diamond had so much ado to stop the cab against it that the breeching broke young diamond jumped off his box knocked loudly at the door then turned to the cab and said before mr evans had quite begun to think something must be amiss   please sir my harness has given away would you mind stepping in here for a few minutes they're friends of mine i'll take you where you like after i've got it mended i shan't be many minutes but you can't stand in this wind  half stupid with fatigue and want of food mr evans yielded to the boy's suggestion and walked in at the door which the maid held with difficulty against the wind she took mr evans for a visitor as indeed he was and showed him into the room on the ground-floor diamond who had followed into the hall whispered to her as she closed the door   tell miss coleman it's miss coleman he wants to see  i don't know said the maid he don't look much like a gentleman  he is though and i know him and so does miss coleman  the maid could not but remember diamond having seen him when he and his father brought the ladies home so she believed him and went to do what he told her  what passed in the little parlour when miss coleman came down does not belong to my story which is all about diamond if he had known that miss coleman thought mr evans was dead perhaps he would have managed differently there was a cry and a running to and fro in the house and then all was quiet again  almost as soon as mr evans went in the wind began to cease and was now still diamond found that by making the breeching just a little tighter than was quite comfortable for the old horse he could do very well for the present and thinking it better to let him have his bag in this quiet place he sat on the box till the old horse should have eaten his dinner in a little while mr evans came out and asked him to come in diamond obeyed and to his delight miss coleman put her arms round him and kissed him and there was payment for him not to mention the five precious shillings she gave him which he could not refuse because his mother wanted them so much at home for his father he left them nearly as happy as they were themselves  the rest of the day he did better and although he had not so much to take home as the day before yet on the whole the result was satisfactory and what a story he had to tell his father and mother about his adventures and how he had done and what was the result they asked him such a multitude of questions some of which he could answer and some of which he could not answer and his father seemed ever so much better from finding that his boy was already not only useful to his family but useful to other people and quite taking his place as a man who judged what was wise and did work worth doing  for a fortnight diamond went on driving his cab and keeping his family he had begun to be known about some parts of london and people would prefer taking his cab because they liked what they heard of him one gentleman who lived near the mews engaged him to carry him to the city every morning at a certain hour and diamond was punctual as clockwork though to effect that required a good deal of care for his father's watch was not much to be depended on and had to be watched itself by the clock of st george's church between the two however he did make a success of it  after that fortnight his father was able to go out again then diamond went to make inquiries about nanny and this led to something else     chapter xxvii the children's hospital   the first day his father resumed his work diamond went with him as usual in the afternoon however his father having taken a fare to the neighbourhood went home and diamond drove the cab the rest of the day it was hard for old diamond to do all the work but they could not afford to have another horse they contrived to save him as much as possible and fed him well and he did bravely  the next morning his father was so much stronger that diamond thought he might go and ask mr raymond to take him to see nanny he found him at home his servant had grown friendly by this time and showed him in without any cross-questioning mr raymond received him with his usual kindness consented at once and walked with him to the hospital which was close at hand it was a comfortable old-fashioned house built in the reign of queen anne and in her day no doubt inhabited by rich and fashionable people  now it was a home for poor sick children who were carefully tended for love's sake there are regions in london where a hospital in every other street might be full of such children whose fathers and mothers are dead or unable to take care of them  when diamond followed mr raymond into the room where those children who had got over the worst of their illness and were growing better lay he saw a number of little iron bedsteads with their heads to the walls and in every one of them a child whose face was a story in itself in some health had begun to appear in a tinge upon the cheeks and a doubtful brightness in the eyes just as out of the cold dreary winter the spring comes in blushing buds and bright crocuses in others there were more of the signs of winter left their faces reminded you of snow and keen cutting winds more than of sunshine and soft breezes and butterflies but even in them the signs of suffering told that the suffering was less and that if the spring-time had but arrived it had yet arrived  diamond looked all round but could see no nanny he turned to mr raymond with a question in his eyes  well said mr raymond  nanny's not here said diamond  oh yes she is  i don't see her  i do though there she is  he pointed to a bed right in front of where diamond was standing  that's not nanny he said  it is nanny i have seen her many times since you have illness makes a great difference  why that girl must have been to the back of the north wind thought diamond but he said nothing only stared and as he stared something of the old nanny began to dawn through the face of the new nanny the old nanny though a good girl and a friendly girl had been rough blunt in her speech and dirty in her person her face would always have reminded one who had already been to the back of the north wind of something he had seen in the best of company but it had been coarse notwithstanding partly from the weather partly from her living amongst low people and partly from having to defend herself  now it was so sweet and gentle and refined that she might have had a lady and gentleman for a father and mother and diamond could not help thinking of words which he had heard in the church the day before  surely it is good to be afflicted or something like that north wind somehow or other must have had to do with her she had grown from a rough girl into a gentle maiden  mr raymond however was not surprised for he was used to see such lovely changes something like the change which passes upon the crawling many-footed creature when it turns sick and ill and revives a butterfly with two wings instead of many feet instead of her having to take care of herself kind hands ministered to her making her comfortable and sweet and clean soothing her aching head and giving her cooling drink when she was thirsty and kind eyes the stars of the kingdom of heaven had shone upon her so that what with the fire of the fever and the dew of tenderness that which was coarse in her had melted away and her whole face had grown so refined and sweet that diamond did not know her but as he gazed the best of the old face all the true and good part of it that which was nanny herself dawned upon him like the moon coming out of a cloud until at length instead of only believing mr raymond that this was she he saw for himself that it was nanny indeed very worn but grown beautiful  he went up to her she smiled he had heard her laugh but had never seen her smile before  nanny do you know me said diamond  she only smiled again as if the question was amusing  she was not likely to forget him for although she did not yet know it was he who had got her there she had dreamed of him often and had talked much about him when delirious nor was it much wonder for he was the only boy except joe who had ever shown her kindness  meantime mr raymond was going from bed to bed talking to the little people every one knew him and every one was eager to have a look and a smile and a kind word from him  diamond sat down on a stool at the head of nanny's bed she laid her hand in his no one else of her old acquaintance had been near her  suddenly a little voice called aloud   won't mr raymond tell us a story  oh yes please do please do cried several little voices which also were stronger than the rest for mr raymond was in the habit of telling them a story when he went to see them and they enjoyed it far more than the other nice things which the doctor permitted him to give them  very well said mr raymond i will what sort of a story shall it be  a true story said one little girl  a fairy tale said a little boy  well said mr raymond i suppose as there is a difference i may choose i can't think of any true story just at this moment so i will tell you a sort of a fairy one  oh jolly exclaimed the little boy who had called out for a fairy tale  it came into my head this morning as i got out of bed continued mr raymond and if it turns out pretty well i will write it down and get somebody to print it for me and then you shall read it when you like  then nobody ever heard it before asked one older child  no nobody  oh exclaimed several thinking it very grand to have the first telling and i daresay there might be a peculiar freshness about it because everything would be nearly as new to the story-teller himself as to the listeners  some were only sitting up and some were lying down so there could not be the same busy gathering bustling and shifting to and fro with which children generally prepare themselves to hear a story but their faces and the turning of their heads and many feeble exclamations of expected pleasure showed that all such preparations were making within them  mr raymond stood in the middle of the room that he might turn from side to side and give each a share of seeing him diamond kept his place by nanny's side with her hand in his i do not know how much of mr raymond's story the smaller children understood indeed i don't quite know how much there was in it to be understood for in such a story every one has just to take what he can get but they all listened with apparent satisfaction and certainly with great attention mr raymond wrote it down afterwards and here it is somewhat altered no doubt for a good story-teller tries to make his stories better every time he tells them i cannot myself help thinking that he was somewhat indebted for this one to the old story of the sleeping beauty     chapter xxviii little daylight   no house of any pretension to be called a palace is in the least worthy of the name except it has a wood near it very near it and the nearer the better not all round it i don't mean that for a palace ought to be open to the sun and wind and stand high and brave with weathercocks glittering and flags flying but on one side of every palace there must be a wood and there was a very grand wood indeed beside the palace of the king who was going to be daylight's father such a grand wood that nobody yet had ever got to the other end of it near the house it was kept very trim and nice and it was free of brushwood for a long way in but by degrees it got wild and it grew wilder and wilder and wilder until some said wild beasts at last did what they liked in it the king and his courtiers often hunted however and this kept the wild beasts far away from the palace  one glorious summer morning when the wind and sun were out together when the vanes were flashing and the flags frolicking against the blue sky little daylight made her appearance from somewhere nobody could tell where a beautiful baby with such bright eyes that she might have come from the sun only by and by she showed such lively ways that she might equally well have come out of the wind there was great jubilation in the palace for this was the first baby the queen had had and there is as much happiness over a new baby in a palace as in a cottage  but there is one disadvantage of living near a wood  you do not know quite who your neighbours may be everybody knew there were in it several fairies living within a few miles of the palace who always had had something to do with each new baby that came for fairies live so much longer than we that they can have business with a good many generations of human mortals the curious houses they lived in were well known also one a hollow oak another a birch-tree though nobody could ever find how that fairy made a house of it another a hut of growing trees intertwined and patched up with turf and moss but there was another fairy who had lately come to the place and nobody even knew she was a fairy except the other fairies a wicked old thing she was always concealing her power and being as disagreeable as she could in order to tempt people to give her offence that she might have the pleasure of taking vengeance upon them the people about thought she was a witch and those who knew her by sight were careful to avoid offending her she lived in a mud house in a swampy part of the forest  in all history we find that fairies give their remarkable gifts to prince or princess or any child of sufficient importance in their eyes always at the christening now this we can understand because it is an ancient custom amongst human beings as well and it is not hard to explain why wicked fairies should choose the same time to do unkind things but it is difficult to understand how they should be able to do them for you would fancy all wicked creatures would be powerless on such an occasion but i never knew of any interference on the part of the wicked fairy that did not turn out a good thing in the end what a good thing for instance it was that one princess should sleep for a hundred years was she not saved from all the plague of young men who were not worthy of her and did she not come awake exactly at the right moment when the right prince kissed her for my part i cannot help wishing a good many girls would sleep till just the same fate overtook them it would be happier for them and more agreeable to their friends  of course all the known fairies were invited to the christening but the king and queen never thought of inviting an old witch  for the power of the fairies they have by nature whereas a witch gets her power by wickedness the other fairies however knowing the danger thus run provided as well as they could against accidents from her quarter but they could neither render her powerless nor could they arrange their gifts in reference to hers beforehand for they could not tell what those might be  of course the old hag was there without being asked not to be asked was just what she wanted that she might have a sort of reason for doing what she wished to do for somehow even the wickedest of creatures likes a pretext for doing the wrong thing  five fairies had one after the other given the child such gifts as each counted best and the fifth had just stepped back to her place in the surrounding splendour of ladies and gentlemen when mumbling a laugh between her toothless gums the wicked fairy hobbled out into the middle of the circle and at the moment when the archbishop was handing the baby to the lady at the head of the nursery department of state affairs addressed him thus giving a bite or two to every word before she could part with it   please your grace i'm very deaf  would your grace mind repeating the princess's name  with pleasure my good woman said the archbishop stooping to shout in her ear  the infant's name is little daylight  and little daylight it shall be cried the fairy in the tone of a dry axle and little good shall any of her gifts do her for i bestow upon her the gift of sleeping all day long whether she will or not ha ha he he hi hi  then out started the sixth fairy who of course the others had arranged should come after the wicked one in order to undo as much as she might  if she sleep all day she said mournfully she shall at least wake all night  a nice prospect for her mother and me thought the poor king for they loved her far too much to give her up to nurses especially at night as most kings and queens do and are sorry for it afterwards  you spoke before i had done said the wicked fairy that's against the law it gives me another chance  i beg your pardon said the other fairies all together  she did i hadn't done laughing said the crone i had only got to hi hi and i had to go through ho ho and hu hu so i decree that if she wakes all night she shall wax and wane with its mistress the moon and what that may mean i hope her royal parents will live to see ho ho hu hu  but out stepped another fairy for they had been wise enough to keep two in reserve because every fairy knew the trick of one  until said the seventh fairy a prince comes who shall kiss her without knowing it  the wicked fairy made a horrid noise like an angry cat and hobbled away she could not pretend that she had not finished her speech this time for she had laughed ho ho and hu hu  i don't know what that means said the poor king to the seventh fairy  don't be afraid the meaning will come with the thing itself said she  the assembly broke up miserable enough the queen at least prepared for a good many sleepless nights and the lady at the head of the nursery department anything but comfortable in the prospect before her for of course the queen could not do it all as for the king he made up his mind with what courage he could summon to meet the demands of the case but wondered whether he could with any propriety require the first lord of the treasury to take a share in the burden laid upon him  i will not attempt to describe what they had to go through for some time but at last the household settled into a regular system a very irregular one in some respects for at certain seasons the palace rang all night with bursts of laughter from little daylight whose heart the old fairy's curse could not reach she was daylight still only a little in the wrong place for she always dropped asleep at the first hint of dawn in the east but her merriment was of short duration when the moon was at the full she was in glorious spirits and as beautiful as it was possible for a child of her age to be but as the moon waned she faded until at last she was wan and withered like the poorest sickliest child you might come upon in the streets of a great city in the arms of a homeless mother then the night was quiet as the day for the little creature lay in her gorgeous cradle night and day with hardly a motion and indeed at last without even a moan like one dead at first they often thought she was dead but at last they got used to it and only consulted the almanac to find the moment when she would begin to revive which of course was with the first appearance of the silver thread of the crescent moon then she would move her lips and they would give her a little nourishment and she would grow better and better and better until for a few days she was splendidly well when well she was always merriest out in the moonlight but even when near her worst she seemed better when in warm summer nights they carried her cradle out into the light of the waning moon then in her sleep she would smile the faintest most pitiful smile  for a long time very few people ever saw her awake as she grew older she became such a favourite however that about the palace there were always some who would contrive to keep awake at night in order to be near her but she soon began to take every chance of getting away from her nurses and enjoying her moonlight alone and thus things went on until she was nearly seventeen years of age her father and mother had by that time got so used to the odd state of things that they had ceased to wonder at them all their arrangements had reference to the state of the princess daylight and it is amazing how things contrive to accommodate themselves but how any prince was ever to find and deliver her appeared inconceivable  as she grew older she had grown more and more beautiful with the sunniest hair and the loveliest eyes of heavenly blue brilliant and profound as the sky of a june day but so much more painful and sad was the change as her bad time came on the more beautiful she was in the full moon the more withered and worn did she become as the moon waned at the time at which my story has now arrived she looked when the moon was small or gone like an old woman exhausted with suffering this was the more painful that her appearance was unnatural for her hair and eyes did not change her wan face was both drawn and wrinkled and had an eager hungry look her skinny hands moved as if wishing but unable to lay hold of something her shoulders were bent forward her chest went in and she stooped as if she were eighty years old at last she had to be put to bed and there await the flow of the tide of life but she grew to dislike being seen still more being touched by any hands during this season one lovely summer evening when the moon lay all but gone upon the verge of the horizon she vanished from her attendants and it was only after searching for her a long time in great terror that they found her fast asleep in the forest at the foot of a silver birch and carried her home  a little way from the palace there was a great open glade covered with the greenest and softest grass this was her favourite haunt for here the full moon shone free and glorious while through a vista in the trees she could generally see more or less of the dying moon as it crossed the opening here she had a little rustic house built for her and here she mostly resided none of the court might go there without leave and her own attendants had learned by this time not to be officious in waiting upon her so that she was very much at liberty whether the good fairies had anything to do with it or not i cannot tell but at last she got into the way of retreating further into the wood every night as the moon waned so that sometimes they had great trouble in finding her but as she was always very angry if she discovered they were watching her they scarcely dared to do so at length one night they thought they had lost her altogether it was morning before they found her feeble as she was she had wandered into a thicket a long way from the glade and there she lay fast asleep of course  although the fame of her beauty and sweetness had gone abroad yet as everybody knew she was under a bad spell no king in the neighbourhood had any desire to have her for a daughter-in-law there were serious objections to such a relation  about this time in a neighbouring kingdom in consequence of the wickedness of the nobles an insurrection took place upon the death of the old king the greater part of the nobility was massacred and the young prince was compelled to flee for his life disguised like a peasant for some time until he got out of the country he suffered much from hunger and fatigue but when he got into that ruled by the princess's father and had no longer any fear of being recognised he fared better for the people were kind he did not abandon his disguise however one tolerable reason was that he had no other clothes to put on and another that he had very little money and did not know where to get any more there was no good in telling everybody he met that he was a prince for he felt that a prince ought to be able to get on like other people else his rank only made a fool of him he had read of princes setting out upon adventure and here he was out in similar case only without having had a choice in the matter he would go on and see what would come of it  for a day or two he had been walking through the palace-wood and had had next to nothing to eat when he came upon the strangest little house inhabited by a very nice tidy motherly old woman this was one of the good fairies the moment she saw him she knew quite well who he was and what was going to come of it but she was not at liberty to interfere with the orderly march of events she received him with the kindness she would have shown to any other traveller and gave him bread and milk which he thought the most delicious food he had ever tasted wondering that they did not have it for dinner at the palace sometimes the old woman pressed him to stay all night when he awoke he was amazed to find how well and strong he felt she would not take any of the money he offered but begged him if he found occasion of continuing in the neighbourhood to return and occupy the same quarters  thank you much good mother answered the prince but there is little chance of that the sooner i get out of this wood the better  i don't know that said the fairy  what do you mean asked the prince  why how should i know returned she  i can't tell said the prince  very well said the fairy  how strangely you talk said the prince  do i said the fairy  yes you do said the prince  very well said the fairy  the prince was not used to be spoken to in this fashion so he felt a little angry and turned and walked away but this did not offend the fairy she stood at the door of her little house looking after him till the trees hid him quite then she said at last and went in  the prince wandered and wandered and got nowhere the sun sank and sank and went out of sight and he seemed no nearer the end of the wood than ever he sat down on a fallen tree ate a bit of bread the old woman had given him and waited for the moon for although he was not much of an astronomer he knew the moon would rise some time because she had risen the night before up she came slow and slow but of a good size pretty nearly round indeed whereupon greatly refreshed with his piece of bread he got up and went he knew not whither  after walking a considerable distance he thought he was coming to the outside of the forest but when he reached what he thought the last of it he found himself only upon the edge of a great open space in it covered with grass the moon shone very bright and he thought he had never seen a more lovely spot still it looked dreary because of its loneliness for he could not see the house at the other side he sat down weary again and gazed into the glade he had not seen so much room for several days  all at once he spied something in the middle of the grass what could it be it moved it came nearer was it a human creature gliding across a girl dressed in white gleaming in the moonshine she came nearer and nearer he crept behind a tree and watched wondering it must be some strange being of the wood a nymph whom the moonlight and the warm dusky air had enticed from her tree but when she came close to where he stood he no longer doubted she was human for he had caught sight of her sunny hair and her clear blue eyes and the loveliest face and form that he had ever seen all at once she began singing like a nightingale and dancing to her own music with her eyes ever turned towards the moon she passed close to where he stood dancing on by the edge of the trees and away in a great circle towards the other side until he could see but a spot of white in the yellowish green of the moonlit grass but when he feared it would vanish quite the spot grew and became a figure once more she approached him again singing and dancing and waving her arms over her head until she had completed the circle just opposite his tree she stood ceased her song dropped her arms and broke out into a long clear laugh musical as a brook then as if tired she threw herself on the grass and lay gazing at the moon the prince was almost afraid to breathe lest he should startle her and she should vanish from his sight as to venturing near her that never came into his head  she had lain for a long hour or longer when the prince began again to doubt concerning her perhaps she was but a vision of his own fancy or was she a spirit of the wood after all if so he too would haunt the wood glad to have lost kingdom and everything for the hope of being near her he would build him a hut in the forest and there he would live for the pure chance of seeing her again upon nights like this at least she would come out and bask in the moonlight and make his soul blessed but while he thus dreamed she sprang to her feet turned her face full to the moon and began singing as she would draw her down from the sky by the power of her entrancing voice she looked more beautiful than ever again she began dancing to her own music and danced away into the distance once more she returned in a similar manner but although he was watching as eagerly as before what with fatigue and what with gazing he fell fast asleep before she came near him when he awoke it was broad daylight and the princess was nowhere  he could not leave the place what if she should come the next night he would gladly endure a day's hunger to see her yet again  he would buckle his belt quite tight he walked round the glade to see if he could discover any prints of her feet but the grass was so short and her steps had been so light that she had not left a single trace behind her he walked half-way round the wood without seeing anything to account for her presence then he spied a lovely little house with thatched roof and low eaves surrounded by an exquisite garden with doves and peacocks walking in it of course this must be where the gracious lady who loved the moonlight lived forgetting his appearance he walked towards the door determined to make inquiries but as he passed a little pond full of gold and silver fishes he caught sight of himself and turned to find the door to the kitchen there he knocked and asked for a piece of bread the good-natured cook brought him in and gave him an excellent breakfast which the prince found nothing the worse for being served in the kitchen while he ate he talked with his entertainer and learned that this was the favourite retreat of the princess daylight but he learned nothing more both because he was afraid of seeming inquisitive and because the cook did not choose to be heard talking about her mistress to a peasant lad who had begged for his breakfast  as he rose to take his leave it occurred to him that he might not be so far from the old woman's cottage as he had thought and he asked the cook whether she knew anything of such a place describing it as well as he could she said she knew it well enough adding with a smile   it's there you're going is it  yes if it's not far off  it's not more than three miles but mind what you are about you know  why do you say that  if you're after any mischief she'll make you repent it  the best thing that could happen under the circumstances remarked the prince  what do you mean by that asked the cook  why it stands to reason answered the prince that if you wish to do anything wrong the best thing for you is to be made to repent of it  i see said the cook well i think you may venture she's a good old soul  which way does it lie from here asked the prince  she gave him full instructions and he left her with many thanks  being now refreshed however the prince did not go back to the cottage that day  he remained in the forest amusing himself as best he could but waiting anxiously for the night in the hope that the princess would again appear nor was he disappointed for directly the moon rose he spied a glimmering shape far across the glade as it drew nearer he saw it was she indeed not dressed in white as before  in a pale blue like the sky she looked lovelier still he thought it was that the blue suited her yet better than the white he did not know that she was really more beautiful because the moon was nearer the full in fact the next night was full moon and the princess would then be at the zenith of her loveliness  the prince feared for some time that she was not coming near his hiding-place that night but the circles in her dance ever widened as the moon rose until at last they embraced the whole glade and she came still closer to the trees where he was hiding than she had come the night before he was entranced with her loveliness for it was indeed a marvellous thing all night long he watched her but dared not go near her he would have been ashamed of watching her too had he not become almost incapable of thinking of anything but how beautiful she was he watched the whole night long and saw that as the moon went down she retreated in smaller and smaller circles until at last he could see her no more  weary as he was he set out for the old woman's cottage where he arrived just in time for her breakfast which she shared with him he then went to bed and slept for many hours when he awoke the sun was down and he departed in great anxiety lest he should lose a glimpse of the lovely vision but whether it was by the machinations of the swamp-fairy or merely that it is one thing to go and another to return by the same road he lost his way i shall not attempt to describe his misery when the moon rose and he saw nothing but trees trees trees  she was high in the heavens before he reached the glade then indeed his troubles vanished for there was the princess coming dancing towards him in a dress that shone like gold and with shoes that glimmered through the grass like fireflies she was of course still more beautiful than before like an embodied sunbeam she passed him and danced away into the distance  before she returned in her circle the clouds had begun to gather about the moon the wind rose the trees moaned and their lighter branches leaned all one way before it the prince feared that the princess would go in and he should see her no more that night but she came dancing on more jubilant than ever her golden dress and her sunny hair streaming out upon the blast waving her arms towards the moon and in the exuberance of her delight ordering the clouds away from off her face the prince could hardly believe she was not a creature of the elements after all  by the time she had completed another circle the clouds had gathered deep and there were growlings of distant thunder just as she passed the tree where he stood a flash of lightning blinded him for a moment and when he saw again to his horror the princess lay on the ground he darted to her thinking she had been struck but when she heard him coming she was on her feet in a moment  what do you want she asked  i beg your pardon i thought the lightning said the prince hesitating  there's nothing the matter said the princess waving him off rather haughtily  the poor prince turned and walked towards the wood  come back said daylight  i like you you do what you are told are you good  not so good as i should like to be said the prince  then go and grow better said the princess  again the disappointed prince turned and went  come back said the princess  he obeyed and stood before her waiting  can you tell me what the sun is like she asked  no he answered but where's the good of asking what you know  but i don't know she rejoined  why everybody knows  that's the very thing  i'm not everybody i've never seen the sun  then you can't know what it's like till you do see it  i think you must be a prince said the princess  do i look like one said the prince  i can't quite say that  then why do you think so  because you both do what you are told and speak the truth is the sun so very bright  as bright as the lightning  but it doesn't go out like that does it  oh no it shines like the moon rises and sets like the moon is much the same shape as the moon only so bright that you can't look at it for a moment  but i would look at it said the princess  but you couldn't said the prince  but i could said the princess  why don't you then  because i can't  why can't you  because i can't wake and i never shall wake until    here she hid her face in her hands turned away and walked in the slowest stateliest manner towards the house the prince ventured to follow her at a little distance but she turned and made a repellent gesture which like a true gentleman-prince he obeyed at once he waited a long time but as she did not come near him again and as the night had now cleared he set off at last for the old woman's cottage  it was long past midnight when he reached it but to his surprise the old woman was paring potatoes at the door fairies are fond of doing odd things indeed however they may dissemble the night is always their day and so it is with all who have fairy blood in them  why what are you doing there this time of the night mother said the prince for that was the kind way in which any young man in his country would address a woman who was much older than himself  getting your supper ready my son she answered  oh i don't want any supper said the prince  ah you've seen daylight said she  i've seen a princess who never saw it said the prince  do you like her asked the fairy  oh don't i said the prince more than you would believe mother  a fairy can believe anything that ever was or ever could be said the old woman  then are you a fairy asked the prince  yes said she  then what do you do for things not to believe asked the prince  there's plenty of them everything that never was nor ever could be  plenty i grant you said the prince but do you believe there could be a princess who never saw the daylight do you believe that now  this the prince said not that he doubted the princess but that he wanted the fairy to tell him more she was too old a fairy however to be caught so easily  of all people fairies must not tell secrets besides she's a princess  well i'll tell you a secret i'm a prince  i know that  how do you know it  by the curl of the third eyelash on your left eyelid  which corner do you count from  that's a secret  another secret well at least if i am a prince there can be no harm in telling me about a princess  it's just the princes i can't tell  there ain't any more of them are there said the prince  what you don't think you're the only prince in the world do you  oh dear no not at all but i know there's one too many just at present except the princess    yes yes that's it said the fairy  what's it asked the prince  but he could get nothing more out of the fairy and had to go to bed unanswered which was something of a trial  now wicked fairies will not be bound by the law which the good fairies obey and this always seems to give the bad the advantage over the good for they use means to gain their ends which the others will not but it is all of no consequence for what they do never succeeds nay in the end it brings about the very thing they are trying to prevent so you see that somehow for all their cleverness wicked fairies are dreadfully stupid for although from the beginning of the world they have really helped instead of thwarting the good fairies not one of them is a bit wiser for it she will try the bad thing just as they all did before her and succeeds no better of course  the prince had so far stolen a march upon the swamp-fairy that she did not know he was in the neighbourhood until after he had seen the princess those three times when she knew it she consoled herself by thinking that the princess must be far too proud and too modest for any young man to venture even to speak to her before he had seen her six times at least but there was even less danger than the wicked fairy thought for however much the princess might desire to be set free she was dreadfully afraid of the wrong prince now however the fairy was going to do all she could  she so contrived it by her deceitful spells that the next night the prince could not by any endeavour find his way to the glade it would take me too long to tell her tricks they would be amusing to us who know that they could not do any harm but they were something other than amusing to the poor prince he wandered about the forest till daylight and then fell fast asleep the same thing occurred for seven following days during which neither could he find the good fairy's cottage after the third quarter of the moon however the bad fairy thought she might be at ease about the affair for a fortnight at least for there was no chance of the prince wishing to kiss the princess during that period so the first day of the fourth quarter he did find the cottage and the next day he found the glade for nearly another week he haunted it but the princess never came i have little doubt she was on the farther edge of it some part of every night but at this period she always wore black and there being little or no light the prince never saw her nor would he have known her if he had seen her how could he have taken the worn decrepit creature she was now for the glorious princess daylight  at last one night when there was no moon at all he ventured near the house there he heard voices talking although it was past midnight for her women were in considerable uneasiness because the one whose turn it was to watch her had fallen asleep and had not seen which way she went and this was a night when she would probably wander very far describing a circle which did not touch the open glade at all but stretched away from the back of the house deep into that side of the forest a part of which the prince knew nothing when he understood from what they said that she had disappeared and that she must have gone somewhere in the said direction he plunged at once into the wood to see if he could find her for hours he roamed with nothing to guide him but the vague notion of a circle which on one side bordered on the house for so much had he picked up from the talk he had overheard  it was getting towards the dawn but as yet there was no streak of light in the sky when he came to a great birch-tree and sat down weary at the foot of it while he sat very miserable you may be sure full of fear for the princess and wondering how her attendants could take it so quietly he bethought himself that it would not be a bad plan to light a fire which if she were anywhere near would attract her this he managed with a tinder-box which the good fairy had given him it was just beginning to blaze up when he heard a moan which seemed to come from the other side of the tree he sprung to his feet but his heart throbbed so that he had to lean for a moment against the tree before he could move when he got round there lay a human form in a little dark heap on the earth there was light enough from his fire to show that it was not the princess he lifted it in his arms hardly heavier than a child and carried it to the flame the countenance was that of an old woman but it had a fearfully strange look a black hood concealed her hair and her eyes were closed he laid her down as comfortably as he could chafed her hands put a little cordial from a bottle also the gift of the fairy into her mouth took off his coat and wrapped it about her and in short did the best he could in a little while she opened her eyes and looked at him so pitifully the tears rose and flowed from her grey wrinkled cheeks but she said never a word she closed her eyes again but the tears kept on flowing and her whole appearance was so utterly pitiful that the prince was near crying too he begged her to tell him what was the matter promising to do all he could to help her but still she did not speak he thought she was dying and took her in his arms again to carry her to the princess's house where he thought the good-natured cook might be able to do something for her when he lifted her the tears flowed yet faster and she gave such a sad moan that it went to his very heart  mother mother he said poor mother and kissed her on the withered lips  she started and what eyes they were that opened upon him but he did not see them for it was still very dark and he had enough to do to make his way through the trees towards the house  just as he approached the door feeling more tired than he could have imagined possible she was such a little thin old thing she began to move and became so restless that unable to carry her a moment longer he thought to lay her on the grass but she stood upright on her feet her hood had dropped and her hair fell about her the first gleam of the morning was caught on her face  that face was bright as the never-aging dawn and her eyes were lovely as the sky of darkest blue the prince recoiled in overmastering wonder it was daylight herself whom he had brought from the forest he fell at her feet nor dared to look up until she laid her hand upon his head he rose then  you kissed me when i was an old woman  there i kiss you when i am a young princess murmured daylight is that the sun coming     chapter xxix ruby   the children were delighted with the story and made many amusing remarks upon it mr raymond promised to search his brain for another and when he had found one to bring it to them diamond having taken leave of nanny and promised to go and see her again soon went away with him  now mr raymond had been turning over in his mind what he could do both for diamond and for nanny he had therefore made some acquaintance with diamond's father and had been greatly pleased with him but he had come to the resolution before he did anything so good as he would like to do for them to put them all to a certain test so as they walked away together he began to talk with diamond as follows    nanny must leave the hospital soon diamond  i'm glad of that sir  why don't you think it's a nice place  yes very but it's better to be well and doing something you know even if it's not quite so comfortable  but they can't keep nanny so long as they would like they can't keep her till she's quite strong there are always so many sick children they want to take in and make better and the question is what will she do when they send her out again  that's just what i can't tell though i've been thinking of it over and over sir her crossing was taken long ago and i couldn't bear to see nanny fighting for it especially with such a poor fellow as has taken it he's quite lame sir  she doesn't look much like fighting now does she diamond  no sir she looks too like an angel angels don't fight do they sir  not to get things for themselves at least said mr raymond  besides added diamond i don't quite see that she would have any better right to the crossing than the boy who has got it nobody gave it to her she only took it and now he has taken it  if she were to sweep a crossing soon at least after the illness she has had she would be laid up again the very first wet day said mr raymond  and there's hardly any money to be got except on the wet days  remarked diamond reflectively is there nothing else she could do sir  not without being taught i'm afraid  well couldn't somebody teach her something  couldn't you teach her diamond  i don't know anything myself sir i could teach her to dress the baby but nobody would give her anything for doing things like that  they are so easy there wouldn't be much good in teaching her to drive a cab for where would she get the cab to drive there ain't fathers and old diamonds everywhere at least poor nanny can't find any of them i doubt  perhaps if she were taught to be nice and clean and only speak gentle words  mother could teach her that interrupted diamond  and to dress babies and feed them and take care of them mr raymond proceeded she might get a place as a nurse somewhere you know people do give money for that  then i'll ask mother said diamond  but you'll have to give her her food then and your father not being strong has enough to do already without that  but here's me said diamond  i help him out with it when he's tired of driving up i get it don't make any difference to old diamond i don't mean he likes me as well as my father of course he can't you know nobody could but he does his duty all the same it's got to be done you know sir and diamond's a good horse isn't he sir  from your description i should say certainly but i have not the pleasure of his acquaintance myself  don't you think he will go to heaven sir  that i don't know anything about said mr raymond i confess i should be glad to think so he added smiling thoughtfully  i'm sure he'll get to the back of the north wind anyhow said diamond to himself but he had learned to be very careful of saying such things aloud  isn't it rather too much for him to go in the cab all day and every day resumed mr raymond  so father says when he feels his ribs of a morning but then he says the old horse do eat well and the moment he's had his supper down he goes and never gets up till he's called and for the legs of him father says that makes no end of a differ some horses sir they won't lie down all night long but go to sleep on their four pins like a haystack father says i think it's very stupid of them and so does old diamond but then i suppose they don't know better and so they can't help it we mustn't be too hard upon them father says  your father must be a good man diamond diamond looked up in mr raymond's face wondering what he could mean  i said your father must be a good man diamond  of course said diamond how could he drive a cab if he wasn't  there are some men who drive cabs who are not very good objected mr raymond  diamond remembered the drunken cabman and saw that his friend was right  ah but he returned he must be you know with such a horse as old diamond  that does make a difference said mr raymond but it is quite enough that he is a good man without our trying to account for it now if you like i will give you a proof that i think him a good man i am going away on the continent for a while for three months i believe and i am going to let my house to a gentleman who does not want the use of my brougham my horse is nearly as old i fancy as your diamond but i don't want to part with him and i don't want him to be idle for nobody as you say ought to be idle but neither do i want him to be worked very hard now it has come into my head that perhaps your father would take charge of him and work him under certain conditions  my father will do what's right said diamond i'm sure of that  well so i think will you ask him when he comes home to call and have a little chat with me to-day some time  he must have his dinner first said diamond no he's got his dinner with him to-day it must be after he's had his tea  of course of course any time will do i shall be at home all day  very well sir i will tell him you may be sure he will come my father thinks you a very kind gentleman and i know he is right for i know your very own self sir  mr raymond smiled and as they had now reached his door they parted and diamond went home as soon as his father entered the house diamond gave him mr raymond's message and recounted the conversation that had preceded it his father said little but took thought-sauce to his bread and butter and as soon as he had finished his meal rose saying   i will go to your friend directly diamond it would be a grand thing to get a little more money we do want it diamond accompanied his father to mr raymond's door and there left him  he was shown at once into mr raymond's study where he gazed with some wonder at the multitude of books on the walls and thought what a learned man mr raymond must be  presently mr raymond entered and after saying much the same about his old horse made the following distinct proposal one not over-advantageous to diamond's father but for which he had reasons namely that joseph should have the use of mr raymond's horse while he was away on condition that he never worked him more than six hours a day and fed him well and that besides he should take nanny home as soon as she was able to leave the hospital and provide for her as one of his own children neither better nor worse so long that is as he had the horse  diamond's father could not help thinking it a pretty close bargain he should have both the girl and the horse to feed and only six hours' work out of the horse  it will save your own horse said mr raymond  that is true answered joseph but all i can get by my own horse is only enough to keep us and if i save him and feed your horse and the girl don't you see sir  well you can go home and think about it and let me know by the end of the week i am in no hurry before then  so joseph went home and recounted the proposal to his wife adding that he did not think there was much advantage to be got out of it  not much that way husband said diamond's mother but there would be an advantage and what matter who gets it  i don't see it answered her husband mr raymond is a gentleman of property and i don't discover any much good in helping him to save a little more he won't easily get one to make such a bargain and i don't mean he shall get me it would be a loss rather than a gain i do think at least if i took less work out of our own horse  one hour would make a difference to old diamond but that's not the main point you must think what an advantage it would be to the poor girl that hasn't a home to go to  she is one of diamond's friends thought his father  i could be kind to her you know the mother went on and teach her housework and how to handle a baby and besides she would help me and i should be the stronger for it and able to do an odd bit of charing now and then when i got the chance  i won't hear of that said her husband have the girl by all means i'm ashamed i did not think of both sides of the thing at once i wonder if the horse is a great eater to be sure if i gave diamond two hours' additional rest it would be all the better for the old bones of him and there would be four hours extra out of the other horse that would give diamond something to do every day he could drive old diamond after dinner and i could take the other horse out for six hours after tea or in the morning as i found best it might pay for the keep of both of them that is if i had good luck i should like to oblige mr raymond though he be rather hard for he has been very kind to our diamond wife hasn't he now  he has indeed joseph said his wife and there the conversation ended  diamond's father went the very next day to mr raymond and accepted his proposal so that the week after having got another stall in the same stable he had two horses instead of one oddly enough the name of the new horse was ruby for he was a very red chestnut diamond's name came from a white lozenge on his forehead young diamond said they were rich now with such a big diamond and such a big ruby     chapter xxx nanny's dream   nanny was not fit to be moved for some time yet and diamond went to see her as often as he could but being more regularly engaged now seeing he went out every day for a few hours with old diamond and had his baby to mind and one of the horses to attend to he could not go so often as he would have liked  one evening as he sat by her bedside she said to him   i've had such a beautiful dream diamond i should like to tell it you  oh do said diamond i am so fond of dreams  she must have been to the back of the north wind he said to himself  it was a very foolish dream you know but somehow it was so pleasant what a good thing it is that you believe the dream all the time you are in it  my readers must not suppose that poor nanny was able to say what she meant so well as i put it down here she had never been to school and had heard very little else than vulgar speech until she came to the hospital but i have been to school and although that could never make me able to dream so well as nanny it has made me able to tell her dream better than she could herself and i am the more desirous of doing this for her that i have already done the best i could for diamond's dream and it would be a shame to give the boy all the advantage  i will tell you all i know about it said nanny the day before yesterday a lady came to see us a very beautiful lady and very beautifully dressed i heard the matron say to her that it was very kind of her to come in blue and gold and she answered that she knew we didn't like dull colours she had such a lovely shawl on just like redness dipped in milk and all worked over with flowers of the same colour it didn't shine much it was silk but it kept in the shine when she came to my bedside she sat down just where you are sitting diamond and laid her hand on the counterpane i was sitting up with my table before me ready for my tea her hand looked so pretty in its blue glove that i was tempted to stroke it i thought she wouldn't be angry for everybody that comes to the hospital is kind it's only in the streets they ain't kind but she drew her hand away and i almost cried for i thought i had been rude instead of that however it was only that she didn't like giving me her glove to stroke for she drew it off and then laid her hand where it was before i wasn't sure but i ventured to put out my ugly hand  your hand ain't ugly nanny said diamond but nanny went on   and i stroked it again and then she stroked mine think of that and there was a ring on her finger and i looked down to see what it was like and she drew it off and put it upon one of my fingers it was a red stone and she told me they called it a ruby  oh that is funny said diamond our new horse is called ruby we've got another horse a red one such a beauty  but nanny went on with her story  i looked at the ruby all the time the lady was talking to me it was so beautiful and as she talked i kept seeing deeper and deeper into the stone at last she rose to go away and i began to pull the ring off my finger and what do you think she said 'wear it all night if you like only you must take care of it i can't give it you for some one gave it to me but you may keep it till to-morrow' wasn't it kind of her i could hardly take my tea i was so delighted to hear it and i do think it was the ring that set me dreaming for after i had taken my tea i leaned back half lying and half sitting and looked at the ring on my finger by degrees i began to dream the ring grew larger and larger until at last i found that i was not looking at a red stone but at a red sunset which shone in at the end of a long street near where grannie lives i was dressed in rags as i used to be and i had great holes in my shoes at which the nasty mud came through to my feet i didn't use to mind it before but now i thought it horrid and there was the great red sunset with streaks of green and gold between standing looking at me why couldn't i live in the sunset instead of in that dirt why was it so far away always why did it never come into our wretched street it faded away as the sunsets always do and at last went out altogether then a cold wind began to blow and flutter all my rags about    that was north wind herself said diamond  eh said nanny and went on with her story  i turned my back to it and wandered away i did not know where i was going only it was warmer to go that way i don't think it was a north wind for i found myself in the west end at last but it doesn't matter in a dream which wind it was  i don't know that said diamond i believe north wind can get into our dreams yes and blow in them sometimes she has blown me out of a dream altogether  i don't know what you mean diamond said nanny  never mind answered diamond two people can't always understand each other they'd both be at the back of the north wind directly and what would become of the other places without them  you do talk so oddly said nanny i sometimes think they must have been right about you  what did they say about me asked diamond  they called you god's baby  how kind of them but i knew that  did you know what it meant though it meant that you were not right in the head  i feel all right said diamond putting both hands to his head as if it had been a globe he could take off and set on again  well as long as you are pleased i am pleased said nanny  thank you nanny do go on with your story i think i like dreams even better than fairy tales but they must be nice ones like yours you know  well i went on keeping my back to the wind until i came to a fine street on the top of a hill how it happened i don't know but the front door of one of the houses was open and not only the front door but the back door as well so that i could see right through the house and what do you think i saw a garden place with green grass and the moon shining upon it think of that there was no moon in the street but through the house there was the moon i looked and there was nobody near  i would not do any harm and the grass was so much nicer than the mud but i couldn't think of going on the grass with such dirty shoes  i kicked them off in the gutter and ran in on my bare feet up the steps and through the house and on to the grass and the moment i came into the moonlight i began to feel better  that's why north wind blew you there said diamond  it came of mr raymond's story about princess daylight returned nanny well i lay down upon the grass in the moonlight without thinking how i was to get out again somehow the moon suited me exactly there was not a breath of the north wind you talk about it was quite gone  you didn't want her any more just then she never goes where she's not wanted said diamond but she blew you into the moonlight anyhow  well we won't dispute about it said nanny  you've got a tile loose you know  suppose i have returned diamond don't you see it may let in the moonlight or the sunlight for that matter  perhaps yes perhaps no said nanny  and you've got your dreams too nanny  yes but i know they're dreams  so do i but i know besides they are something more as well  oh do you rejoined nanny i don't  all right said diamond perhaps you will some day  perhaps i won't said nanny  diamond held his peace and nanny resumed her story  i lay a long time and the moonlight got in at every tear in my clothes and made me feel so happy    there i tell you said diamond  what do you tell me returned nanny  north wind    it was the moonlight i tell you persisted nanny and again diamond held his peace  all at once i felt that the moon was not shining so strong i looked up and there was a cloud all crapey and fluffy trying to drown the beautiful creature but the moon was so round just like a whole plate that the cloud couldn't stick to her she shook it off and said there and shone out clearer and brighter than ever but up came a thicker cloud and 'you shan't' said the moon and 'i will' said the cloud but it couldn't  out shone the moon quite laughing at its impudence i knew her ways for i've always been used to watch her she's the only thing worth looking at in our street at night  don't call it your street said diamond you're not going back to it you're coming to us you know  that's too good to be true said nanny  there are very few things good enough to be true said diamond but i hope this is too good to be true it can't be isn't true good and isn't good good and how then can anything be too good to be true that's like old sal to say that  don't abuse grannie diamond she's a horrid old thing she and her gin bottle but she'll repent some day and then you'll be glad not to have said anything against her  why said diamond  because you'll be sorry for her  i am sorry for her now  very well that's right she'll be sorry too and there'll be an end of it  all right you come to us said diamond  where was i said nanny  telling me how the moon served the clouds  yes but it wouldn't do all of it up came the clouds and the clouds and they came faster and faster until the moon was covered up you couldn't expect her to throw off a hundred of them at once could you  certainly not said diamond  so it grew very dark and a dog began to yelp in the house i looked and saw that the door to the garden was shut presently it was opened not to let me out but to let the dog in yelping and bounding i thought if he caught sight of me i was in for a biting first and the police after so i jumped up and ran for a little summer-house in the corner of the garden the dog came after me but i shut the door in his face it was well it had a door wasn't it  you dreamed of the door because you wanted it said diamond  no i didn't it came of itself it was there in the true dream  there i've caught you said diamond i knew you believed in the dream as much as i do  oh well if you will lay traps for a body said nanny anyhow i was safe inside the summer-house and what do you think there was the moon beginning to shine again but only through one of the panes and that one was just the colour of the ruby wasn't it funny  no not a bit funny said diamond  if you will be contrary said nanny  no no said diamond i only meant that was the very pane i should have expected her to shine through  oh very well returned nanny  what diamond meant i do not pretend to say he had curious notions about things  and now said nanny i didn't know what to do for the dog kept barking at the door and i couldn't get out but the moon was so beautiful that i couldn't keep from looking at it through the red pane and as i looked it got larger and larger till it filled the whole pane and outgrew it so that i could see it through the other panes and it grew till it filled them too and the whole window so that the summer-house was nearly as bright as day  the dog stopped barking and i heard a gentle tapping at the door like the wind blowing a little branch against it  just like her said diamond who thought everything strange and beautiful must be done by north wind  so i turned from the window and opened the door and what do you think i saw  a beautiful lady said diamond  no the moon itself as big as a little house and as round as a ball shining like yellow silver it stood on the grass down on the very grass  i could see nothing else for the brightness of it  and as i stared and wondered a door opened in the side of it near the ground and a curious little old man with a crooked thing over his shoulder looked out and said  'come along nanny my lady wants you we're come to fetch you i wasn't a bit frightened i went up to the beautiful bright thing and the old man held down his hand and i took hold of it and gave a jump and he gave me a lift and i was inside the moon and what do you think it was like it was such a pretty little house with blue windows and white curtains at one of the windows sat a beautiful lady with her head leaning on her hand looking out she seemed rather sad and i was sorry for her and stood staring at her  `you didn't think i had such a beautiful mistress as that' said the queer little man `no indeed' i answered  `who would have thought it' `ah who indeed but you see you don't know everything' the little man closed the door and began to pull at a rope which hung behind it with a weight at the end after he had pulled a while he said `there that will do we're all right now' then he took me by the hand and opened a little trap in the floor and led me down two or three steps and i saw like a great hole below me `don't be frightened' said the tittle man `it's not a hole it's only a window put your face down and look through' i did as he told me and there was the garden and the summer-house far away lying at the bottom of the moonlight `there' said the little man `we've brought you off do you see the little dog barking at us down there in the garden' i told him i couldn't see anything so far `can you see anything so small and so far off' i said `bless you child' said the little man `i could pick up a needle out of the grass if i had only a long enough arm there's one lying by the door of the summer-house now' i looked at his eyes they were very small but so bright that i think he saw by the light that went out of them then he took me up and up again by a little stair in a corner of the room and through another trapdoor and there was one great round window above us and i saw the blue sky and the clouds and such lots of stars all so big and shining as hard as ever they could  the little girl-angels had been polishing them said diamond  what nonsense you do talk said nanny  but my nonsense is just as good as yours nanny when you have done i'll tell you my dream the stars are in it not the moon though she was away somewhere perhaps she was gone to fetch you then i don't think that though for my dream was longer ago than yours she might have been to fetch some one else though for we can't fancy it's only us that get such fine things done for them but do tell me what came next  perhaps one of my child-readers may remember whether the moon came down to fetch him or her the same night that diamond had his dream i cannot tell of course i know she did not come to fetch me though i did think i could make her follow me when i was a boy not a very tiny one either  the little man took me all round the house and made me look out of every window oh it was beautiful there we were all up in the air in such a nice clean little house `your work will be to keep the windows bright' said the little man `you won't find it very difficult for there ain't much dust up here only the frost settles on them sometimes and the drops of rain leave marks on them' `i can easily clean them inside' i said `but how am i to get the frost and rain off the outside of them' `oh' he said `it's quite easy there are ladders all about you've only got to go out at the door and climb about there are a great many windows you haven't seen yet and some of them look into places you don't know anything about i used to clean them myself but i'm getting rather old you see ain't i now' `i can't tell' i answered `you see i never saw you when you were younger' `never saw the man in the moon' said he `not very near' i answered `not to tell how young or how old he looked i have seen the bundle of sticks on his back' for jim had pointed that out to me jim was very fond of looking at the man in the moon poor jim i wonder he hasn't been to see me i'm afraid he's ill too  i'll try to find out said diamond and let you know  thank you said nanny you and jim ought to be friends  but what did the man in the moon say when you told him you had seen him with the bundle of sticks on his back  he laughed but i thought he looked offended too his little nose turned up sharper and he drew the corners of his mouth down from the tips of his ears into his neck but he didn't look cross you know  didn't he say anything  oh yes he said  `that's all nonsense what you saw was my bundle of dusters i was going to clean the windows it takes a good many you know really what they do say of their superiors down there' `it's only because they don't know better' i ventured to say `of course of course' said the little man `nobody ever does know better well i forgive them and that sets it all right i hope' `it's very good of you' i said `no' said he `it's not in the least good of me i couldn't be comfortable otherwise' after this he said nothing for a while and i laid myself on the floor of his garret and stared up and around at the great blue beautifulness i had forgotten him almost when at last he said  `ain't you done yet' `done what' i asked `done saying your prayers' says he 'i wasn't saying my prayers' i answered `oh yes you were' said he `though you didn't know it and now i must show you something else'  he took my hand and led me down the stair again and through a narrow passage and through another and another and another i don't know how there could be room for so many passages in such a little house the heart of it must be ever so much farther from the sides than they are from each other how could it have an inside that was so independent of its outside there's the point it was funny wasn't it diamond  no said diamond he was going to say that that was very much the sort of thing at the back of the north wind but he checked himself and only added all right i don't see it i don't see why the inside should depend on the outside it ain't so with the crabs they creep out of their outsides and make new ones mr raymond told me so  i don't see what that has got to do with it said nanny  then go on with your story please said diamond what did you come to after going through all those winding passages into the heart of the moon  i didn't say they were winding passages i said they were long and narrow they didn't wind they went by corners  that's worth knowing remarked diamond for who knows how soon he may have to go there but the main thing is what did you come to at last  we came to a small box against the wall of a tiny room the little man told me to put my ear against it i did so and heard a noise something like the purring of a cat only not so loud and much sweeter `what is it' i asked `don't you know the sound' returned the little man `no' i answered `don't you know the sound of bees' he said i had never heard bees and could not know the sound of them `those are my lady's bees' he went on i had heard that bees gather honey from the flowers `but where are the flowers for them' i asked `my lady's bees gather their honey from the sun and the stars' said the little man `do let me see them' i said `no i daren't do that' he answered `i have no business with them i don't understand them besides they are so bright that if one were to fly into your eye it would blind you altogether' `then you have seen them' `oh yes once or twice i think but i don't quite know  they are so very bright like buttons of lightning now i've showed you all i can to-night and we'll go back to the room' i followed him and he made me sit down under a lamp that hung from the roof and gave me some bread and honey  the lady had never moved she sat with her forehead leaning on her hand gazing out of the little window hung like the rest with white cloudy curtains from where i was sitting i looked out of it too but i could see nothing her face was very beautiful and very white and very still and her hand was as white as the forehead that leaned on it i did not see her whole face only the side of it for she never moved to turn it full upon me or even to look at me  how long i sat after i had eaten my bread and honey i don't know the little man was busy about the room pulling a string here and a string there but chiefly the string at the back of the door i was thinking with some uneasiness that he would soon be wanting me to go out and clean the windows and i didn't fancy the job at last he came up to me with a great armful of dusters `it's time you set about the windows' he said `for there's rain coming and if they're quite clean before then the rain can't spoil them' i got up at once `you needn't be afraid' he said `you won't tumble off only you must be careful always hold on with one hand while you rub with the other' as he spoke he opened the door i started back in a terrible fright for there was nothing but blue air to be seen under me like a great water without a bottom at all but what must be must and to live up here was so much nicer than down in the mud with holes in my shoes that i never thought of not doing as i was told the little man showed me how and where to lay hold while i put my foot round the edge of the door on to the first round of a ladder `once you're up' he said `you'll see how you have to go well enough' i did as he told me and crept out very carefully then the little man handed me the bundle of dusters saying `i always carry them on my reaping hook but i don't think you could manage it properly you shall have it if you like' i wouldn't take it however for it looked dangerous  i did the best i could with the dusters and crawled up to the top of the moon but what a grand sight it was the stars were all over my head so bright and so near that i could almost have laid hold of them the round ball to which i clung went bobbing and floating away through the dark blue above and below and on every side it was so beautiful that all fear left me and i set to work diligently i cleaned window after window at length i came to a very little one in at which i peeped there was the room with the box of bees in it i laid my ear to the window and heard the musical hum quite distinctly a great longing to see them came upon me and i opened the window and crept in the little box had a door like a closet i opened it the tiniest crack when out came the light with such a sting that i closed it again in terror not however before three bees had shot out into the room where they darted about like flashes of lightning terribly frightened i tried to get out of the window again but i could not  there was no way to the outside of the moon but through the door and that was in the room where the lady sat no sooner had i reached the room than the three bees which had followed me flew at once to the lady and settled upon her hair then first i saw her move she started put up her hand and caught them then rose and having held them into the flame of the lamp one after the other turned to me her face was not so sad now as stern it frightened me much `nanny you have got me into trouble' she said `you have been letting out my bees which it is all i can do to manage you have forced me to burn them it is a great loss and there will be a storm' as she spoke the clouds had gathered all about us i could see them come crowding up white about the windows `i am sorry to find' said the lady `that you are not to be trusted you must go home again you won't do for us' then came a great clap of thunder and the moon rocked and swayed all grew dark about me and i fell on the floor and lay half-stunned i could hear everything but could see nothing `shall i throw her out of the door my lady' said the little man `no' she answered `she's not quite bad enough for that i don't think there's much harm in her only she'll never do for us she would make dreadful mischief up here she's only fit for the mud it's a great pity i am sorry for her just take that ring off her finger i am sadly afraid she has stolen it' the little man caught hold of my hand and i felt him tugging at the ring i tried to speak what was true about it but after a terrible effort only gave a groan other things began to come into my head somebody else had a hold of me the little man wasn't there i opened my eyes at last and saw the nurse i had cried out in my sleep and she had come and waked me but diamond for all it was only a dream i cannot help being ashamed of myself yet for opening the lady's box of bees  you wouldn't do it again would you if she were to take you back  said diamond  no i don't think anything would ever make me do it again but where's the good i shall never have the chance  i don't know that said diamond  you silly baby it was only a dream said nanny  i know that nanny dear but how can you tell you mayn't dream it again  that's not a bit likely  i don't know that said diamond  you're always saying that said nanny i don't like it  then i won't say it again if i don't forget said diamond but it was such a beautiful dream wasn't it nanny what a pity you opened that door and let the bees out you might have had such a long dream and such nice talks with the moon-lady do try to go again nanny i do so want to hear more  but now the nurse came and told him it was time to go and diamond went saying to himself i can't help thinking that north wind had something to do with that dream it would be tiresome to lie there all day and all night too without dreaming perhaps if she hadn't done that the moon might have carried her to the back of the north wind who knows     chapter xxxi the north wind doth blow   it was a great delight to diamond when at length nanny was well enough to leave the hospital and go home to their house she was not very strong yet but diamond's mother was very considerate of her and took care that she should have nothing to do she was not quite fit for if nanny had been taken straight from the street it is very probable she would not have been so pleasant in a decent household or so easy to teach but after the refining influences of her illness and the kind treatment she had had in the hospital she moved about the house just like some rather sad pleasure haunting the mind as she got better and the colour came back to her cheeks her step grew lighter and quicker her smile shone out more readily and it became certain that she would soon be a treasure of help it was great fun to see diamond teaching her how to hold the baby and wash and dress him and often they laughed together over her awkwardness but she had not many such lessons before she was able to perform those duties quite as well as diamond himself  things however did not go well with joseph from the very arrival of ruby it almost seemed as if the red beast had brought ill luck with him the fares were fewer and the pay less ruby's services did indeed make the week's income at first a little beyond what it used to be but then there were two more to feed after the first month he fell lame and for the whole of the next joseph dared not attempt to work him i cannot say that he never grumbled for his own health was far from what it had been but i can say that he tried to do his best during all that month they lived on very short commons indeed seldom tasting meat except on sundays and poor old diamond who worked hardest of all not even then so that at the end of it he was as thin as a clothes-horse while ruby was as plump and sleek as a bishop's cob  nor was it much better after ruby was able to work again for it was a season of great depression in business and that is very soon felt amongst the cabmen city men look more after their shillings and their wives and daughters have less to spend it was besides a wet autumn and bread rose greatly in price when i add to this that diamond's mother was but poorly for a new baby was coming you will see that these were not very jolly times for our friends in the mews  notwithstanding the depressing influences around him joseph was able to keep a little hope alive in his heart and when he came home at night would get diamond to read to him and would also make nanny produce her book that he might see how she was getting on for diamond had taken her education in hand and as she was a clever child she was very soon able to put letters and words together  thus the three months passed away but mr raymond did not return joseph had been looking anxiously for him chiefly with the desire of getting rid of ruby not that he was absolutely of no use to him but that he was a constant weight upon his mind indeed as far as provision went he was rather worse off with ruby and nanny than he had been before but on the other hand nanny was a great help in the house and it was a comfort to him to think that when the new baby did come nanny would be with his wife  of god's gifts a baby is of the greatest therefore it is no wonder that when this one came she was as heartily welcomed by the little household as if she had brought plenty with her of course she made a great difference in the work to be done far more difference than her size warranted but nanny was no end of help and diamond was as much of a sunbeam as ever and began to sing to the new baby the first moment he got her in his arms but he did not sing the same songs to her that he had sung to his brother for he said she was a new baby and must have new songs and besides she was a sister-baby and not a brother-baby and of course would not like the same kind of songs where the difference in his songs lay however i do not pretend to be able to point out one thing i am sure of that they not only had no small share in the education of the little girl but helped the whole family a great deal more than they were aware  how they managed to get through the long dreary expensive winter i can hardly say sometimes things were better sometimes worse but at last the spring came and the winter was over and gone and that was much still mr raymond did not return and although the mother would have been able to manage without nanny now they could not look for a place for her so long as they had ruby and they were not altogether sorry for this one week at last was worse than they had yet had they were almost without bread before it was over but the sadder he saw his father and mother looking the more diamond set himself to sing to the two babies  one thing which had increased their expenses was that they had been forced to hire another little room for nanny when the second baby came diamond gave up his room that nanny might be at hand to help his mother and went to hers which although a fine place to what she had been accustomed to was not very nice in his eyes he did not mind the change though for was not his mother the more comfortable for it and was not nanny more comfortable too and indeed was not diamond himself more comfortable that other people were more comfortable and if there was more comfort every way the change was a happy one     chapter xxxii diamond and ruby   it was friday night and diamond like the rest of the household had had very little to eat that day the mother would always pay the week's rent before she laid out anything even on food his father had been very gloomy so gloomy that he had actually been cross to his wife it is a strange thing how pain of seeing the suffering of those we love will sometimes make us add to their suffering by being cross with them this comes of not having faith enough in god and shows how necessary this faith is for when we lose it we lose even the kindness which alone can soothe the suffering diamond in consequence had gone to bed very quiet and thoughtful a little troubled indeed  it had been a very stormy winter and even now that the spring had come the north wind often blew when diamond went to his bed which was in a tiny room in the roof he heard it like the sea moaning and when he fell asleep he still heard the moaning all at once he said to himself am i awake or am i asleep but he had no time to answer the question for there was north wind calling him his heart beat very fast it was such a long time since he had heard that voice he jumped out of bed and looked everywhere but could not see her diamond come here she said again and again but where the here was he could not tell to be sure the room was all but quite dark and she might be close beside him  dear north wind said diamond i want so much to go to you but i can't tell where  come here diamond was all her answer  diamond opened the door and went out of the room and down the stair and into the yard his little heart was in a flutter for he had long given up all thought of seeing her again neither now was he to see her when he got out a great puff of wind came against him and in obedience to it he turned his back and went as it blew it blew him right up to the stable-door and went on blowing  she wants me to go into the stable said diamond to himself but the door is locked  he knew where the key was in a certain hole in the wall far too high for him to get at he ran to the place however  just as he reached it there came a wild blast and down fell the key clanging on the stones at his feet he picked it up and ran back and opened the stable-door and went in and what do you think he saw  a little light came through the dusty window from a gas-lamp sufficient to show him diamond and ruby with their two heads up looking at each other across the partition of their stalls the light showed the white mark on diamond's forehead but ruby's eye shone so bright that he thought more light came out of it than went in this is what he saw  but what do you think he heard  he heard the two horses talking to each other in a strange language which yet somehow or other he could understand and turn over in his mind in english the first words he heard were from diamond who apparently had been already quarrelling with ruby  look how fat you are ruby said old diamond you are so plump and your skin shines so you ought to be ashamed of yourself  there's no harm in being fat said ruby in a deprecating tone no nor in being sleek i may as well shine as not  no harm retorted diamond is it no harm to go eating up all poor master's oats and taking up so much of his time grooming you when you only work six hours no not six hours a day and as i hear get along no faster than a big dray-horse with two tons behind him so they tell me  your master's not mine said ruby i must attend to my own master's interests and eat all that is given me and be sleek and fat as i can and go no faster than i need  now really if the rest of the horses weren't all asleep poor things they work till they're tired i do believe they would get up and kick you out of the stable you make me ashamed of being a horse you dare to say my master ain't your master that's your gratitude for the way he feeds you and spares you pray where would your carcass be if it weren't for him  he doesn't do it for my sake if i were his own horse he would work me as hard as he does you  and i'm proud to be so worked i wouldn't be as fat as you not for all you're worth you're a disgrace to the stable look at the horse next you he's something like a horse all skin and bone and his master ain't over kind to him either he put a stinging lash on his whip last week but that old horse knows he's got the wife and children to keep as well as his drunken master and he works like a horse i daresay he grudges his master the beer he drinks but i don't believe he grudges anything else  well i don't grudge yours what he gets by me said ruby  gets retorted diamond what he gets isn't worth grudging it comes to next to nothing what with your fat and shine  well at least you ought to be thankful you're the better for it you get a two hours' rest a day out of it  i thank my master for that not you you lazy fellow you go along like a buttock of beef upon castors you do  ain't you afraid i'll kick if you go on like that diamond  kick you couldn't kick if you tried you might heave your rump up half a foot but for lashing out oho if you did you'd be down on your belly before you could get your legs under you again it's my belief once out they'd stick out for ever talk of kicking why don't you put one foot before the other now and then when you're in the cab the abuse master gets for your sake is quite shameful no decent horse would bring it on him depend upon it ruby no cabman likes to be abused any more than his fare but his fares at least when you are between the shafts are very much to be excused indeed they are  well you see diamond i don't want to go lame again  i don't believe you were so very lame after all there  oh but i was  then i believe it was all your own fault i'm not lame i never was lame in all my life you don't take care of your legs you never lay them down at night there you are with your huge carcass crushing down your poor legs all night long you don't even care for your own legs so long as you can eat eat and sleep sleep you a horse indeed  but i tell you i was lame  i'm not denying there was a puffy look about your off-pastern but my belief is it wasn't even grease it was fat  i tell you i put my foot on one of those horrid stones they make the roads with and it gave my ankle such a twist  ankle indeed why should you ape your betters horses ain't got any ankles  they're only pasterns and so long as you don't lift your feet better but fall asleep between every step you'll run a good chance of laming all your ankles as you call them one after another it's not your lively horse that comes to grief in that way i tell you i believe it wasn't much and if it was it was your own fault there i've done i'm going to sleep i'll try to think as well of you as i can if you would but step out a bit and run off a little of your fat here diamond began to double up his knees but ruby spoke again and as young diamond thought in a rather different tone  i say diamond i can't bear to have an honest old horse like you think of me like that i will tell you the truth  it was my own fault that i fell lame  i told you so returned the other tumbling against the partition as he rolled over on his side to give his legs every possible privilege in their narrow circumstances  i meant to do it diamond  at the words the old horse arose with a scramble like thunder shot his angry head and glaring eye over into ruby's stall and said   keep out of my way you unworthy wretch or i'll bite you you a horse why did you do that  because i wanted to grow fat  you grease-tub oh my teeth and tail i thought you were a humbug why did you want to get fat there's no truth to be got out of you but by cross-questioning you ain't fit to be a horse  because once i am fat my nature is to keep fat for a long time and i didn't know when master might come home and want to see me  you conceited good-for-nothing brute you're only fit for the knacker's yard you wanted to look handsome did you hold your tongue or i'll break my halter and be at you with your handsome fat  never mind diamond you're a good horse you can't hurt me  can't hurt you just let me once try  no you can't  why then  because i'm an angel  what's that  of course you don't know  indeed i don't  i know you don't an ignorant rude old human horse like you couldn't know it but there's young diamond listening to all we're saying and he knows well enough there are horses in heaven for angels to ride upon as well as other animals lions and eagles and bulls in more important situations the horses the angels ride must be angel-horses else the angels couldn't ride upon them well i'm one of them  you ain't  did you ever know a horse tell a lie  never before but you've confessed to shamming lame  nothing of the sort it was necessary i should grow fat and necessary that good joseph your master should grow lean i could have pretended to be lame but that no horse least of all an angel-horse would do so i must be lame and so i sprained my ankle for the angel-horses have ankles they don't talk horse-slang up there and it hurt me very much i assure you diamond though you mayn't be good enough to be able to believe it  old diamond made no reply he had lain down again and a sleepy snort very like a snore revealed that if he was not already asleep he was past understanding a word that ruby was saying when young diamond found this he thought he might venture to take up the dropt shuttlecock of the conversation  i'm good enough to believe it ruby he said  but ruby never turned his head or took any notice of him i suppose he did not understand more of english than just what the coachman and stableman were in the habit of addressing him with finding however that his companion made no reply he shot his head over the partition and looking down at him said   you just wait till to-morrow and you'll see whether i'm speaking the truth or not i declare the old horse is fast asleep diamond no i won't  ruby turned away and began pulling at his hayrack in silence  diamond gave a shiver and looking round saw that the door of the stable was open he began to feel as if he had been dreaming and after a glance about the stable to see if north wind was anywhere visible he thought he had better go back to bed     chapter xxxiii the prospect brightens   the next morning diamond's mother said to his father i'm not quite comfortable about that child again  which child martha asked joseph you've got a choice now  well diamond i mean i'm afraid he's getting into his queer ways again he's been at his old trick of walking in his sleep i saw him run up the stair in the middle of the night  didn't you go after him wife  of course i did and found him fast asleep in his bed it's because he's had so little meat for the last six weeks i'm afraid  it may be that i'm very sorry but if it don't please god to send us enough what am i to do wife  you can't help it i know my dear good man returned martha and after all i don't know i don't see why he shouldn't get on as well as the rest of us there i'm nursing baby all this time and i get along pretty well i'm sure to hear the little man singing you wouldn't think there was much amiss with him  for at that moment diamond was singing like a lark in the clouds he had the new baby in his arms while his mother was dressing herself joseph was sitting at his breakfast a little weak tea dry bread and very dubious butter which nanny had set for him and which he was enjoying because he was hungry he had groomed both horses and had got old diamond harnessed ready to put to  think of a fat angel dulcimer said diamond  the baby had not been christened yet but diamond in reading his bible had come upon the word dulcimer and thought it so pretty that ever after he called his sister dulcimer  think of a red fat angel dulcimer he repeated for ruby's an angel of a horse dulcimer he sprained his ankle and got fat on purpose  what purpose diamond asked his father  ah that i can't tell i suppose to look handsome when his master comes answered diamond what do you think dulcimer it must be for some good for ruby's an angel  i wish i were rid of him anyhow said his father for he weighs heavy on my mind  no wonder father  he's so fat said diamond but you needn't be afraid for everybody says he's in better condition than when you had him  yes but he may be as thin as a tin horse before his owner comes it was too bad to leave him on my hands this way  perhaps he couldn't help it suggested diamond i daresay he has some good reason for it  so i should have said returned his father if he had not driven such a hard bargain with me at first  but we don't know what may come of it yet husband said his wife mr raymond may give a little to boot seeing you've had more of the bargain than you wanted or reckoned upon  i'm afraid not  he's a hard man said joseph as he rose and went to get his cab out  diamond resumed his singing for some time he carolled snatches of everything or anything but at last it settled down into something like what follows i cannot tell where or how he got it               where did you come from baby dear             out of the everywhere into here              where did you get your eyes so blue             out of the sky as i came through              what makes the light in them sparkle and spin             some of the starry spikes left in              where did you get that little tear             i found it waiting when i got here              what makes your forehead so smooth and high             a soft hand stroked it as i went by              what makes your cheek like a warm white rose             i saw something better than any one knows              whence that three-cornered smile of bliss             three angels gave me at once a kiss              where did you get this pearly ear             god spoke and it came out to hear              where did you get those arms and hands             love made itself into hooks and bands              feet whence did you come you darling things             from the same box as the cherubs' wings              how did they all just come to be you             god thought about me and so i grew              but how did you come to us you dear             god thought about you and so i am here  you never made that song diamond said his mother  no mother i wish i had no i don't that would be to take it from somebody else but it's mine for all that  what makes it yours  i love it so  does loving a thing make it yours  i think so mother at least more than anything else can if i didn't love baby which couldn't be you know she wouldn't be mine a bit but i do love baby and baby is my very own dulcimer  the baby's mine diamond  that makes her the more mine mother  how do you make that out  because you're mine mother  is that because you love me  yes just because love makes the only myness said diamond  when his father came home to have his dinner and change diamond for ruby they saw him look very sad and he told them he had not had a fare worth mentioning the whole morning  we shall all have to go to the workhouse wife he said  it would be better to go to the back of the north wind said diamond dreamily not intending to say it aloud  so it would answered his father but how are we to get there diamond  we must wait till we're taken returned diamond  before his father could speak again a knock came to the door and in walked mr raymond with a smile on his face joseph got up and received him respectfully but not very cordially martha set a chair for him but he would not sit down  you are not very glad to see me he said to joseph you don't want to part with the old horse  indeed sir you are mistaken there what with anxiety about him and bad luck i've wished i were rid of him a thousand times it was only to be for three months and here it's eight or nine  i'm sorry to hear such a statement said mr raymond hasn't he been of service to you  not much not with his lameness  ah said mr raymond hastily you've been laming him have you that accounts for it i see i see  it wasn't my fault and he's all right now i don't know how it happened but   he did it on purpose said diamond he put his foot on a stone just to twist his ankle  how do you know that diamond said his father turning to him i never said so for i could not think how it came  i heard it in the stable answered diamond  let's have a look at him said mr raymond  if you'll step into the yard said joseph i'll bring him out  they went and joseph having first taken off his harness walked ruby into the middle of the yard  why said mr raymond you've not been using him well  i don't know what you mean by that sir i didn't expect to hear that from you he's sound in wind and limb as sound as a barrel  and as big you might add why he's as fat as a pig you don't call that good usage  joseph was too angry to make any answer  you've not worked him enough i say that's not making good use of him that's not doing as you'd be done by  i shouldn't be sorry if i was served the same sir  he's too fat i say  there was a whole month i couldn't work him at all and he did nothing but eat his head off he's an awful eater i've taken the best part of six hours a day out of him since but i'm always afraid of his coming to grief again and so i couldn't make the most even of that i declare to you sir when he's between the shafts i sit on the box as miserable as if i'd stolen him he looks all the time as if he was a bottling up of complaints to make of me the minute he set eyes on you again there look at him now squinting round at me with one eye i declare to you on my word i haven't laid the whip on him more than three times  i'm glad to hear it he never did want the whip  i didn't say that sir if ever a horse wanted the whip he do he's brought me to beggary almost with his snail's pace i'm very glad you've come to rid me of him  i don't know that said mr raymond suppose i were to ask you to buy him of me cheap  i wouldn't have him in a present sir i don't like him and i wouldn't drive a horse that i didn't like no not for gold it can't come to good where there's no love between 'em  just bring out your own horse and let me see what sort of a pair they'd make  joseph laughed rather bitterly as he went to fetch diamond  when the two were placed side by side mr raymond could hardly keep his countenance but from a mingling of feelings beside the great red round barrel ruby all body and no legs diamond looked like a clothes-horse with a skin thrown over it there was hardly a spot of him where you could not descry some sign of a bone underneath gaunt and grim and weary he stood kissing his master and heeding no one else  you haven't been using him well said mr raymond  i must say returned joseph throwing an arm round his horse's neck that the remark had better have been spared sir the horse is worth three of the other now  i don't think so i think they make a very nice pair if the one's too fat the other's too lean so that's all right and if you won't buy my ruby i must buy your diamond  thank you sir said joseph in a tone implying anything but thanks  you don't seem to like the proposal said mr raymond  i don't returned joseph i wouldn't part with my old diamond for his skin as full of nuggets as it is of bones  who said anything about parting with him  you did now sir  no i didn't i only spoke of buying him to make a pair with ruby we could pare ruby and patch diamond a bit and for height they are as near a match as i care about of course you would be the coachman if only you would consent to be reconciled to ruby  joseph stood bewildered unable to answer  i've bought a small place in kent continued mr raymond and i must have a pair to my carriage for the roads are hilly thereabouts i don't want to make a show with a pair of high-steppers i think these will just do suppose for a week or two you set yourself to take ruby down and bring diamond up if we could only lay a pipe from ruby's sides into diamond's it would be the work of a moment but i fear that wouldn't answer  a strong inclination to laugh intruded upon joseph's inclination to cry and made speech still harder than before  i beg your pardon sir he said at length i've been so miserable and for so long that i never thought you was only a chaffing of me when you said i hadn't used the horses well i did grumble at you sir many's the time in my trouble but whenever i said anything my little diamond would look at me with a smile as much as to say  'i know him better than you father' and upon my word i always thought the boy must be right  will you sell me old diamond then  i will sir on one condition that if ever you want to part with him or me you give me the option of buying him i could not part with him sir as to who calls him his that's nothing for as diamond says it's only loving a thing that can make it yours and i do love old diamond sir dearly  well there's a cheque for twenty pounds which i wrote to offer you for him in case i should find you had done the handsome thing by ruby will that be enough  it's too much sir his body ain't worth it shoes and all it's only his heart sir that's worth millions but his heart'll be mine all the same so it's too much sir  i don't think so it won't be at least by the time we've got him fed up again you take it and welcome just go on with your cabbing for another month only take it out of ruby and let diamond rest and by that time i shall be ready for you to go down into the country  thank you sir thank you diamond set you down for a friend sir the moment he saw you i do believe that child of mine knows more than other people  i think so too said mr raymond as he walked away  he had meant to test joseph when he made the bargain about ruby but had no intention of so greatly prolonging the trial he had been taken ill in switzerland and had been quite unable to return sooner he went away now highly gratified at finding that he had stood the test and was a true man  joseph rushed in to his wife who had been standing at the window anxiously waiting the result of the long colloquy when she heard that the horses were to go together in double harness she burst forth into an immoderate fit of laughter diamond came up with the baby in his arms and made big anxious eyes at her saying   what is the matter with you mother dear do cry a little it will do you good when father takes ever so small a drop of spirits he puts water to it  you silly darling said his mother how could i but laugh at the notion of that great fat ruby going side by side with our poor old diamond  but why not mother with a month's oats and nothing to do diamond'll be nearer ruby's size than you will father's i think it's very good for different sorts to go together now ruby will have a chance of teaching diamond better manners  how dare you say such a thing diamond said his father angrily to compare the two for manners there's no comparison possible our diamond's a gentleman  i don't mean to say he isn't father for i daresay some gentlemen judge their neighbours unjustly that's all i mean diamond shouldn't have thought such bad things of ruby he didn't try to make the best of him  how do you know that pray  i heard them talking about it one night  who  why diamond and ruby ruby's an angel  joseph stared and said no more for all his new gladness he was very gloomy as he re-harnessed the angel for he thought his darling diamond was going out of his mind  he could not help thinking rather differently however when he found the change that had come over ruby considering his fat he exerted himself amazingly and got over the ground with incredible speed so willing even anxious was he to go now that joseph had to hold him quite tight  then as he laughed at his own fancies a new fear came upon him lest the horse should break his wind and mr raymond have good cause to think he had not been using him well he might even suppose that he had taken advantage of his new instructions to let out upon the horse some of his pent-up dislike whereas in truth it had so utterly vanished that he felt as if ruby too had been his friend all the time     chapter xxxiv in the country   before the end of the month ruby had got respectably thin and diamond respectably stout they really began to look fit for double harness  joseph and his wife got their affairs in order and everything ready for migrating at the shortest notice and they felt so peaceful and happy that they judged all the trouble they had gone through well worth enduring as for nanny she had been so happy ever since she left the hospital that she expected nothing better and saw nothing attractive in the notion of the country at the same time she had not the least idea of what the word country meant for she had never seen anything about her but streets and gas-lamps besides she was more attached to jim than to diamond  jim was a reasonable being diamond in her eyes at best only an amiable over-grown baby whom no amount of expostulation would ever bring to talk sense not to say think it now that she could manage the baby as well as he she judged herself altogether his superior towards his father and mother she was all they could wish  diamond had taken a great deal of pains and trouble to find jim and had at last succeeded through the help of the tall policeman who was glad to renew his acquaintance with the strange child jim had moved his quarters and had not heard of nanny's illness till some time after she was taken to the hospital where he was too shy to go and inquire about her but when at length she went to live with diamond's family jim was willing enough to go and see her it was after one of his visits during which they had been talking of her new prospects that nanny expressed to diamond her opinion of the country  there ain't nothing in it but the sun and moon diamond  there's trees and flowers said diamond  well they ain't no count returned nanny  ain't they they're so beautiful they make you happy to look at them  that's because you're such a silly  diamond smiled with a far-away look as if he were gazing through clouds of green leaves and the vision contented him but he was thinking with himself what more he could do for nanny and that same evening he went to find mr raymond for he had heard that he had returned to town  ah how do you do diamond said mr raymond i am glad to see you  and he was indeed for he had grown very fond of him his opinion of him was very different from nanny's  what do you want now my child he asked  i'm always wanting something sir answered diamond  well that's quite right so long as what you want is right everybody is always wanting something only we don't mention it in the right place often enough what is it now  there's a friend of nanny's a lame boy called jim  i've heard of him said mr raymond well  nanny doesn't care much about going to the country sir  well what has that to do with jim  you couldn't find a corner for jim to work in could you sir  i don't know that i couldn't that is if you can show good reason for it  he's a good boy sir  well so much the better for him  i know he can shine boots sir  so much the better for us  you want your boots shined in the country don't you sir  yes to be sure  it wouldn't be nice to walk over the flowers with dirty boots would it sir  no indeed  they wouldn't like it would they  no they wouldn't  then nanny would be better pleased to go sir  if the flowers didn't like dirty boots to walk over them nanny wouldn't mind going to the country is that it i don't quite see it  no sir i didn't mean that i meant if you would take jim with you to clean your boots and do odd jobs you know sir then nanny would like it better she's so fond of jim  now you come to the point diamond i see what you mean exactly i will turn it over in my mind could you bring jim to see me  i'll try sir but they don't mind me much they think i'm silly  added diamond with one of his sweetest smiles  what mr raymond thought i dare hardly attempt to put down here but one part of it was that the highest wisdom must ever appear folly to those who do not possess it  i think he would come though after dark you know diamond continued he does well at shining boots people's kind to lame boys you know sir but after dark there ain't so much doing  diamond succeeded in bringing jim to mr raymond and the consequence was that he resolved to give the boy a chance he provided new clothes for both him and nanny and upon a certain day joseph took his wife and three children and nanny and jim by train to a certain station in the county of kent where they found a cart waiting to carry them and their luggage to the mound which was the name of mr raymond's new residence i will not describe the varied feelings of the party as they went or when they arrived all i will say is that diamond who is my only care was full of quiet delight a gladness too deep to talk about  joseph returned to town the same night and the next morning drove ruby and diamond down with the carriage behind them and mr raymond and a lady in the carriage for mr raymond was an old bachelor no longer  he was bringing his wife with him to live at the mound the moment nanny saw her she recognised her as the lady who had lent her the ruby-ring that ring had been given her by mr raymond  the weather was very hot and the woods very shadowy there were not a great many wild flowers for it was getting well towards autumn and the most of the wild flowers rise early to be before the leaves because if they did not they would never get a glimpse of the sun for them so they have their fun over and are ready to go to bed again by the time the trees are dressed but there was plenty of the loveliest grass and daisies about the house and diamond's chief pleasure seemed to be to lie amongst them and breathe the pure air but all the time he was dreaming of the country at the back of the north wind and trying to recall the songs the river used to sing for this was more like being at the back of the north wind than anything he had known since he left it sometimes he would have his little brother sometimes his little sister and sometimes both of them in the grass with him and then he felt just like a cat with her first kittens he said only he couldn't purr all he could do was to sing  these were very different times from those when he used to drive the cab but you must not suppose that diamond was idle he did not do so much for his mother now because nanny occupied his former place but he helped his father still both in the stable and the harness-room and generally went with him on the box that he might learn to drive a pair and be ready to open the carriage-door mr raymond advised his father to give him plenty of liberty  a boy like that he said ought not to be pushed  joseph assented heartily smiling to himself at the idea of pushing diamond after doing everything that fell to his share the boy had a wealth of time at his disposal and a happy sometimes a merry time it was only for two months or so he neither saw nor heard anything of north wind     chapter xxxv i make diamond's acquaintance   mr raymond's house was called the mound because it stood upon a little steep knoll so smooth and symmetrical that it showed itself at once to be artificial it had beyond doubt been built for queen elizabeth as a hunting tower a place namely from the top of which you could see the country for miles on all sides and so be able to follow with your eyes the flying deer and the pursuing hounds and horsemen the mound had been cast up to give a good basement-advantage over the neighbouring heights and woods there was a great quarry-hole not far off brim-full of water from which as the current legend stated the materials forming the heart of the mound a kind of stone unfit for building had been dug the house itself was of brick and they said the foundations were first laid in the natural level and then the stones and earth of the mound were heaped about and between them so that its great height should be well buttressed  joseph and his wife lived in a little cottage a short way from the house it was a real cottage with a roof of thick thatch which in june and july the wind sprinkled with the red and white petals it shook from the loose topmost sprays of the rose-trees climbing the walls at first diamond had a nest under this thatch a pretty little room with white muslin curtains but afterwards mr and mrs raymond wanted to have him for a page in the house and his father and mother were quite pleased to have him employed without his leaving them so he was dressed in a suit of blue from which his pale face and fair hair came out like the loveliest blossom and took up his abode in the house  would you be afraid to sleep alone diamond asked his mistress  i don't know what you mean ma'am said diamond i never was afraid of anything that i can recollect not much at least  there's a little room at the top of the house all alone she returned perhaps you would not mind sleeping there  i can sleep anywhere and i like best to be high up should i be able to see out  i will show you the place she answered and taking him by the hand she led him up and up the oval-winding stair in one of the two towers  near the top they entered a tiny little room with two windows from which you could see over the whole country diamond clapped his hands with delight  you would like this room then diamond said his mistress  it's the grandest room in the house he answered i shall be near the stars and yet not far from the tops of the trees that's just what i like  i daresay he thought also that it would be a nice place for north wind to call at in passing but he said nothing of that sort below him spread a lake of green leaves with glimpses of grass here and there at the bottom of it as he looked down he saw a squirrel appear suddenly and as suddenly vanish amongst the topmost branches  aha little squirrel he cried my nest is built higher than yours  you can be up here with your books as much as you like said his mistress i will have a little bell hung at the door which i can ring when i want you half-way down the stair is the drawing-room  so diamond was installed as page and his new room got ready for him  it was very soon after this that i came to know diamond i was then a tutor in a family whose estate adjoined the little property belonging to the mound i had made the acquaintance of mr raymond in london some time before and was walking up the drive towards the house to call upon him one fine warm evening when i saw diamond for the first time he was sitting at the foot of a great beech-tree a few yards from the road with a book on his knees he did not see me i walked up behind the tree and peeping over his shoulder saw that he was reading a fairy-book  what are you reading i said and spoke suddenly with the hope of seeing a startled little face look round at me diamond turned his head as quietly as if he were only obeying his mother's voice and the calmness of his face rebuked my unkind desire and made me ashamed of it  i am reading the story of the little lady and the goblin prince said diamond  i am sorry i don't know the story i returned who is it by  mr raymond made it  is he your uncle i asked at a guess  no he's my master  what do you do for him i asked respectfully  anything he wishes me to do he answered i am busy for him now he gave me this story to read he wants my opinion upon it  don't you find it rather hard to make up your mind  oh dear no any story always tells me itself what i'm to think about it mr raymond doesn't want me to say whether it is a clever story or not but whether i like it and why i like it i never can tell what they call clever from what they call silly but i always know whether i like a story or not  and can you always tell why you like it or not  no very often i can't at all sometimes i can i always know but i can't always tell why mr raymond writes the stories and then tries them on me mother does the same when she makes jam she's made such a lot of jam since we came here and she always makes me taste it to see if it'll do mother knows by the face i make whether it will or not  at this moment i caught sight of two more children approaching one was a handsome girl the other a pale-faced awkward-looking boy who limped much on one leg i withdrew a little to see what would follow for they seemed in some consternation after a few hurried words they went off together and i pursued my way to the house where i was as kindly received by mr and mrs raymond as i could have desired from them i learned something of diamond and was in consequence the more glad to find him when i returned seated in the same place as before  what did the boy and girl want with you diamond i asked  they had seen a creature that frightened them  and they came to tell you about it  they couldn't get water out of the well for it so they wanted me to go with them  they're both bigger than you  yes but they were frightened at it  and weren't you frightened at it  no  why  because i'm silly i'm never frightened at things  i could not help thinking of the old meaning of the word silly  and what was it i asked  i think it was a kind of an angel a very little one it had a long body and great wings which it drove about it so fast that they grew a thin cloud all round it it flew backwards and forwards over the well or hung right in the middle making a mist of its wings as if its business was to take care of the water  and what did you do to drive it away  i didn't drive it away i knew whatever the creature was the well was to get water out of so i took the jug dipped it in and drew the water  and what did the creature do  flew about  and it didn't hurt you  no why should it i wasn't doing anything wrong  what did your companions say then  they said `thank you diamond what a dear silly you are'  and weren't you angry with them  no why should i i should like if they would play with me a little but they always like better to go away together when their work is over they never heed me i don't mind it much though the other creatures are friendly they don't run away from me only they're all so busy with their own work they don't mind me much  do you feel lonely then  oh no when nobody minds me i get into my nest and look up and then the sky does mind me and thinks about me  where is your nest  he rose saying i will show you and led me to the other side of the tree  there hung a little rope-ladder from one of the lower boughs the boy climbed up the ladder and got upon the bough then he climbed farther into the leafy branches and went out of sight  after a little while i heard his voice coming down out of the tree  i am in my nest now said the voice  i can't see you i returned  i can't see you either but i can see the first star peeping out of the sky i should like to get up into the sky don't you think i shall some day  yes i do tell me what more you see up there  i don't see anything more except a few leaves and the big sky over me it goes swinging about the earth is all behind my back there comes another star the wind is like kisses from a big lady when i get up here i feel as if i were in north wind's arms  this was the first i heard of north wind  the whole ways and look of the child so full of quiet wisdom yet so ready to accept the judgment of others in his own dispraise took hold of my heart and i felt myself wonderfully drawn towards him it seemed to me somehow as if little diamond possessed the secret of life and was himself what he was so ready to think the lowest living thing an angel of god with something special to say or do a gush of reverence came over me and with a single goodnight i turned and left him in his nest  i saw him often after this and gained so much of his confidence that he told me all i have told you i cannot pretend to account for it i leave that for each philosophical reader to do after his own fashion the easiest way is that of nanny and jim who said often to each other that diamond had a tile loose but mr raymond was much of my opinion concerning the boy while mrs raymond confessed that she often rang her bell just to have once more the pleasure of seeing the lovely stillness of the boy's face with those blue eyes which seemed rather made for other people to look into than for himself to look out of  it was plainer to others than to himself that he felt the desertion of nanny and jim they appeared to regard him as a mere toy except when they found he could minister to the scruple of using him generally with success they were however well-behaved to a wonderful degree while i have little doubt that much of their good behaviour was owing to the unconscious influence of the boy they called god's baby  one very strange thing is that i could never find out where he got some of his many songs at times they would be but bubbles blown out of a nursery rhyme as was the following which i heard him sing one evening to his little dulcimer there were about a score of sheep feeding in a paddock near him their white wool dyed a pale rose in the light of the setting sun those in the long shadows from the trees were dead white those in the sunlight were half glorified with pale rose            little bo peep she lost her sheep             and didn't know where to find them          they were over the height and out of sight             trailing their tails behind them           little bo peep woke out of her sleep             jump'd up and set out to find them           the silly things they've got no wings             and they've left their trails behind them      they've taken their tails but they've left their trails    and so i shall follow and find them     for wherever a tail had dragged a trail    the long grass grew behind them     and day's eyes and butter-cups cow's lips and crow's feet    were glittering in the sun    she threw down her book and caught up her crook    and after her sheep did run     she ran and she ran and ever as she ran    the grass grew higher and higher    till over the hill the sun began    to set in a flame of fire     she ran on still up the grassy hill    and the grass grew higher and higher    when she reached its crown the sun was down    and had left a trail of fire     the sheep and their tails were gone all gone     and no more trail behind them    yes yes  they were there long-tailed and fair    but alas  she could not find them     purple and gold and rosy and blue    with their tails all white behind them    her sheep they did run in the trail of the sun    she saw them but could not find them     after the sun like clouds they did run    but she knew they were her sheep     she sat down to cry and look up at the sky    but she cried herself asleep     and as she slept the dew fell fast    and the wind blew from the sky    and strange things took place that shun the day's face    because they are sweet and shy     nibble nibble crop  she heard as she woke     a hundred little lambs    did pluck and eat the grass so sweet    that grew in the trails of their dams     little bo peep caught up her crook    and wiped the tears that did blind her    and nibble nibble crop without a stop    the lambs came eating behind her     home home she came both tired and lame    with three times as many sheep    in a month or more they'll be as big as before    and then she'll laugh in her sleep     but what would you say if one fine day    when they've got their bushiest tails    their grown up game should be just the same    and she have to follow their trails     never weep bo peep though you lose your sheep    and do not know where to find them    'tis after the sun the mothers have run    and there are their lambs behind them  i confess again to having touched up a little but it loses far more in diamond's sweet voice singing it than it gains by a rhyme here and there  some of them were out of books mr raymond had given him these he always knew but about the others he could seldom tell sometimes he would say i made that one but generally he would say i don't know i found it somewhere or i got it at the back of the north wind  one evening i found him sitting on the grassy slope under the house with his dulcimer in his arms and his little brother rolling on the grass beside them he was chanting in his usual way more like the sound of a brook than anything else i can think of when i went up to them he ceased his chant  do go on diamond don't mind me i said  he began again at once while he sang nanny and jim sat a little way off one hemming a pocket-handkerchief and the other reading a story to her but they never heeded diamond this is as near what he sang as i can recollect or reproduce rather     what would you see if i took you up    to my little nest in the air    you would see the sky like a clear blue cup    turned upside downwards there     what would you do if i took you there    to my little nest in the tree    my child with cries would trouble the air    to get what she could but see     what would you get in the top of the tree    for all your crying and grief    not a star would you clutch of all you see     you could only gather a leaf     but when you had lost your greedy grief    content to see from afar    you would find in your hand a withering leaf    in your heart a shining star  as diamond went on singing it grew very dark and just as he ceased there came a great flash of lightning that blinded us all for a moment dulcimer crowed with pleasure but when the roar of thunder came after it the little brother gave a loud cry of terror nanny and jim came running up to us pale with fear diamond's face too was paler than usual but with delight some of the glory seemed to have clung to it and remained shining  you're not frightened are you diamond i said  no why should i be he answered with his usual question looking up in my face with calm shining eyes  he ain't got sense to be frightened said nanny going up to him and giving him a pitying hug  perhaps there's more sense in not being frightened nanny i returned do you think the lightning can do as it likes  it might kill you said jim  oh no it mightn't said diamond  as he spoke there came another great flash and a tearing crack  there's a tree struck i said and when we looked round after the blinding of the flash had left our eyes we saw a huge bough of the beech-tree in which was diamond's nest hanging to the ground like the broken wing of a bird  there cried nanny i told you so if you had been up there you see what would have happened you little silly  no i don't said diamond and began to sing to dulcimer all i could hear of the song for the other children were going on with their chatter was                        the clock struck one                      and the mouse came down                      dickery dickery dock  then there came a blast of wind and the rain followed in straight-pouring lines as if out of a watering-pot diamond jumped up with his little dulcimer in his arms and nanny caught up the little boy and they ran for the cottage jim vanished with a double shuffle and i went into the house  when i came out again to return home the clouds were gone and the evening sky glimmered through the trees blue and pale-green towards the west i turned my steps a little aside to look at the stricken beech i saw the bough torn from the stem and that was all the twilight would allow me to see while i stood gazing down from the sky came a sound of singing but the voice was neither of lark nor of nightingale  it was sweeter than either  it was the voice of diamond up in his airy nest                         the lightning and thunder                      they go and they come                      but the stars and the stillness                      are always at home  and then the voice ceased  good-night diamond i said  good-night sir answered diamond  as i walked away pondering i saw the great black top of the beech swaying about against the sky in an upper wind and heard the murmur as of many dim half-articulate voices filling the solitude around diamond's nest     chapter xxxvi diamond questions north wind   my readers will not wonder that after this i did my very best to gain the friendship of diamond nor did i find this at all difficult the child was so ready to trust upon one subject alone was he reticent the story of his relations with north wind i fancy he could not quite make up his mind what to think of them at all events it was some little time before he trusted me with this only then he told me everything if i could not regard it all in exactly the same light as he did i was while guiltless of the least pretence fully sympathetic and he was satisfied without demanding of me any theory of difficult points involved i let him see plainly enough that whatever might be the explanation of the marvellous experience i would have given much for a similar one myself  on an evening soon after the thunderstorm in a late twilight with a half-moon high in the heavens i came upon diamond in the act of climbing by his little ladder into the beech-tree  what are you always going up there for diamond i heard nanny ask rather rudely i thought  sometimes for one thing sometimes for another nanny answered diamond looking skywards as he climbed  you'll break your neck some day she said  i'm going up to look at the moon to-night he added without heeding her remark  you'll see the moon just as well down here she returned  i don't think so  you'll be no nearer to her up there  oh yes i shall i must be nearer her you know i wish i could dream as pretty dreams about her as you can nanny  you silly you never have done about that dream i never dreamed but that one and it was nonsense enough i'm sure  it wasn't nonsense it was a beautiful dream and a funny one too both in one  but what's the good of talking about it that way when you know it was only a dream dreams ain't true  that one was true nanny you know it was didn't you come to grief for doing what you were told not to do and isn't that true  i can't get any sense into him exclaimed nanny with an expression of mild despair do you really believe diamond that there's a house in the moon with a beautiful lady and a crooked old man and dusters in it  if there isn't there's something better he answered and vanished in the leaves over our heads  i went into the house where i visited often in the evenings when i came out there was a little wind blowing very pleasant after the heat of the day for although it was late summer now it was still hot the tree-tops were swinging about in it i took my way past the beech and called up to see if diamond were still in his nest in its rocking head  are you there diamond i said  yes sir came his clear voice in reply  isn't it growing too dark for you to get down safely  oh no sir if i take time to it i know my way so well and never let go with one hand till i've a good hold with the other  do be careful i insisted foolishly seeing the boy was as careful as he could be already  i'm coming he returned i've got all the moon i want to-night   i heard a rustling and a rustling drawing nearer and nearer three or four minutes elapsed and he appeared at length creeping down his little ladder i took him in my arms and set him on the ground  thank you sir he said that's the north wind blowing isn't it sir  i can't tell i answered it feels cool and kind and i think it may be but i couldn't be sure except it were stronger for a gentle wind might turn any way amongst the trunks of the trees  i shall know when i get up to my own room said diamond i think i hear my mistress's bell good-night sir  he ran to the house and i went home  his mistress had rung for him only to send him to bed for she was very careful over him and i daresay thought he was not looking well when he reached his own room he opened both his windows one of which looked to the north and the other to the east to find how the wind blew it blew right in at the northern window diamond was very glad for he thought perhaps north wind herself would come now  a real north wind had never blown all the time since he left london but as she always came of herself and never when he was looking for her and indeed almost never when he was thinking of her he shut the east window and went to bed perhaps some of my readers may wonder that he could go to sleep with such an expectation and indeed if i had not known him i should have wondered at it myself but it was one of his peculiarities and seemed nothing strange in him he was so full of quietness that he could go to sleep almost any time if he only composed himself and let the sleep come this time he went fast asleep as usual  but he woke in the dim blue night the moon had vanished he thought he heard a knocking at his door somebody wants me he said to himself and jumping out of bed ran to open it  but there was no one there he closed it again and the noise still continuing found that another door in the room was rattling it belonged to a closet he thought but he had never been able to open it the wind blowing in at the window must be shaking it he would go and see if it was so  the door now opened quite easily but to his surprise instead of a closet he found a long narrow room the moon which was sinking in the west shone in at an open window at the further end the room was low with a coved ceiling and occupied the whole top of the house immediately under the roof it was quite empty the yellow light of the half-moon streamed over the dark floor he was so delighted at the discovery of the strange desolate moonlit place close to his own snug little room that he began to dance and skip about the floor the wind came in through the door he had left open and blew about him as he danced and he kept turning towards it that it might blow in his face he kept picturing to himself the many places lovely and desolate the hill-sides and farm-yards and tree-tops and meadows over which it had blown on its way to the mound and as he danced he grew more and more delighted with the motion and the wind his feet grew stronger and his body lighter until at length it seemed as if he were borne up on the air and could almost fly so strong did his feeling become that at last he began to doubt whether he was not in one of those precious dreams he had so often had in which he floated about on the air at will but something made him look up and to his unspeakable delight he found his uplifted hands lying in those of north wind who was dancing with him round and round the long bare room her hair now falling to the floor now filling the arched ceiling her eyes shining on him like thinking stars and the sweetest of grand smiles playing breezily about her beautiful mouth she was as so often before of the height of a rather tall lady she did not stoop in order to dance with him but held his hands high in hers when he saw her he gave one spring and his arms were about her neck and her arms holding him to her bosom the same moment she swept with him through the open window in at which the moon was shining made a circuit like a bird about to alight and settled with him in his nest on the top of the great beech-tree there she placed him on her lap and began to hush him as if he were her own baby and diamond was so entirely happy that he did not care to speak a word at length however he found that he was going to sleep and that would be to lose so much that pleasant as it was he could not consent  please dear north wind he said i am so happy that i'm afraid it's a dream how am i to know that it's not a dream  what does it matter returned north wind  i should cry said diamond  but why should you cry the dream if it is a dream is a pleasant one is it not  that's just why i want it to be true  have you forgotten what you said to nanny about her dream  it's not for the dream itself i mean it's not for the pleasure of it answered diamond for i have that whether it be a dream or not it's for you north wind i can't bear to find it a dream because then i should lose you you would be nobody then and i could not bear that you ain't a dream are you dear north wind do say no else i shall cry and come awake and you'll be gone for ever i daren't dream about you once again if you ain't anybody  i'm either not a dream or there's something better that's not a dream diamond said north wind in a rather sorrowful tone he thought  but it's not something better it's you i want north wind he persisted already beginning to cry a little  she made no answer but rose with him in her arms and sailed away over the tree-tops till they came to a meadow where a flock of sheep was feeding  do you remember what the song you were singing a week ago says about bo-peep how she lost her sheep but got twice as many lambs asked north wind sitting down on the grass and placing him in her lap as before  oh yes i do well enough answered diamond but i never just quite liked that rhyme  why not child  because it seems to say one's as good as another or two new ones are better than one that's lost i've been thinking about it a great deal and it seems to me that although any one sixpence is as good as any other sixpence not twenty lambs would do instead of one sheep whose face you knew somehow when once you've looked into anybody's eyes right deep down into them i mean nobody will do for that one any more nobody ever so beautiful or so good will make up for that one going out of sight so you see north wind i can't help being frightened to think that perhaps i am only dreaming and you are nowhere at all do tell me that you are my own real beautiful north wind  again she rose and shot herself into the air as if uneasy because she could not answer him and diamond lay quiet in her arms waiting for what she would say he tried to see up into her face for he was dreadfully afraid she was not answering him because she could not say that she was not a dream but she had let her hair fall all over her face so that he could not see it this frightened him still more  do speak north wind he said at last  i never speak when i have nothing to say she replied  then i do think you must be a real north wind and no dream said diamond  but i'm looking for something to say all the time  but i don't want you to say what's hard to find if you were to say one word to comfort me that wasn't true then i should know you must be a dream for a great beautiful lady like you could never tell a lie  but she mightn't know how to say what she had to say so that a little boy like you would understand it said north wind here let us get down again and i will try to tell you what i think you musn't suppose i am able to answer all your questions though there are a great many things i don't understand more than you do  she descended on a grassy hillock in the midst of a wild furzy common there was a rabbit-warren underneath and some of the rabbits came out of their holes in the moonlight looking very sober and wise just like patriarchs standing in their tent-doors and looking about them before going to bed when they saw north wind instead of turning round and vanishing again with a thump of their heels they cantered slowly up to her and snuffled all about her with their long upper lips which moved every way at once that was their way of kissing her and as she talked to diamond she would every now and then stroke down their furry backs or lift and play with their long ears they would diamond thought have leaped upon her lap but that he was there already  i think said she after they had been sitting silent for a while that if i were only a dream you would not have been able to love me so you love me when you are not with me don't you  indeed i do answered diamond stroking her hand i see i see how could i be able to love you as i do if you weren't there at all you know besides i couldn't be able to dream anything half so beautiful all out of my own head or if i did i couldn't love a fancy of my own like that could i  i think not you might have loved me in a dream dreamily and forgotten me when you woke i daresay but not loved me like a real being as you love me even then i don't think you could dream anything that hadn't something real like it somewhere but you've seen me in many shapes diamond  you remember i was a wolf once don't you  oh yes a good wolf that frightened a naughty drunken nurse  well suppose i were to turn ugly would you rather i weren't a dream then  yes for i should know that you were beautiful inside all the same you would love me and i should love you all the same i shouldn't like you to look ugly you know but i shouldn't believe it a bit  not if you saw it  no not if i saw it ever so plain  there's my diamond i will tell you all i know about it then i don't think i am just what you fancy me to be i have to shape myself various ways to various people but the heart of me is true people call me by dreadful names and think they know all about me but they don't sometimes they call me bad fortune sometimes evil chance sometimes ruin and they have another name for me which they think the most dreadful of all  what is that asked diamond smiling up in her face  i won't tell you that name do you remember having to go through me to get into the country at my back  oh yes i do how cold you were north wind and so white all but your lovely eyes my heart grew like a lump of ice and then i forgot for a while  you were very near knowing what they call me then would you be afraid of me if you had to go through me again  no why should i indeed i should be glad enough if it was only to get another peep of the country at your back  you've never seen it yet  haven't i north wind oh i'm so sorry i thought i had what did i see then  only a picture of it the real country at my real back is ever so much more beautiful than that you shall see it one day perhaps before very long  do they sing songs there  don't you remember the dream you had about the little boys that dug for the stars  yes that i do i thought you must have had something to do with that dream it was so beautiful  yes i gave you that dream  oh thank you did you give nanny her dream too about the moon and the bees  yes i was the lady that sat at the window of the moon  oh thank you i was almost sure you had something to do with that too and did you tell mr raymond the story about the princess daylight  i believe i had something to do with it at all events he thought about it one night when he couldn't sleep but i want to ask you whether you remember the song the boy-angels sang in that dream of yours  no i couldn't keep it do what i would and i did try  that was my fault  how could that be north wind  because i didn't know it properly myself and so i couldn't teach it to you i could only make a rough guess at something like what it would be and so i wasn't able to make you dream it hard enough to remember it nor would i have done so if i could for it was not correct i made you dream pictures of it though but you will hear the very song itself when you do get to the back of    my own dear north wind said diamond finishing the sentence for her and kissing the arm that held him leaning against her  and now we've settled all this for the time at least said north wind  but i can't feel quite sure yet said diamond  you must wait a while for that meantime you may be hopeful and content not to be quite sure come now i will take you home again for it won't do to tire you too much  oh no no i'm not the least tired pleaded diamond  it is better though  very well if you wish it yielded diamond with a sigh  you are a dear good boy said north wind i will come for you again to-morrow night and take you out for a longer time we shall make a little journey together in fact we shall start earlier and as the moon will be later we shall have a little moonlight all the way  she rose and swept over the meadow and the trees in a few moments the mound appeared below them she sank a little and floated in at the window of diamond's room there she laid him on his bed covered him over and in a moment he was lapt in a dreamless sleep     chapter xxxvii once more   the next night diamond was seated by his open window with his head on his hand rather tired but so eagerly waiting for the promised visit that he was afraid he could not sleep but he started suddenly and found that he had been already asleep he rose and looking out of the window saw something white against his beech-tree it was north wind she was holding by one hand to a top branch her hair and her garments went floating away behind her over the tree whose top was swaying about while the others were still  are you ready diamond she asked  yes answered diamond quite ready  in a moment she was at the window and her arms came in and took him she sailed away so swiftly that he could at first mark nothing but the speed with which the clouds above and the dim earth below went rushing past but soon he began to see that the sky was very lovely with mottled clouds all about the moon on which she threw faint colours like those of mother-of-pearl or an opal the night was warm and in the lady's arms he did not feel the wind which down below was making waves in the ripe corn and ripples on the rivers and lakes at length they descended on the side of an open earthy hill just where from beneath a stone a spring came bubbling out  i am going to take you along this little brook said north wind i am not wanted for anything else to-night so i can give you a treat  she stooped over the stream and holding diamond down close to the surface of it glided along level with its flow as it ran down the hill and the song of the brook came up into diamond's ears and grew and grew and changed with every turn it seemed to diamond to be singing the story of its life to him and so it was it began with a musical tinkle which changed to a babble and then to a gentle rushing sometimes its song would almost cease and then break out again tinkle babble and rush all at once at the bottom of the hill they came to a small river into which the brook flowed with a muffled but merry sound along the surface of the river darkly clear below them in the moonlight they floated now where it widened out into a little lake they would hover for a moment over a bed of water-lilies and watch them swing about folded in sleep as the water on which they leaned swayed in the presence of north wind and now they would watch the fishes asleep among their roots below sometimes she would hold diamond over a deep hollow curving into the bank that he might look far into the cool stillness sometimes she would leave the river and sweep across a clover-field the bees were all at home and the clover was asleep then she would return and follow the river it grew wider and wider as it went now the armies of wheat and of oats would hang over its rush from the opposite banks now the willows would dip low branches in its still waters and now it would lead them through stately trees and grassy banks into a lovely garden where the roses and lilies were asleep the tender flowers quite folded up and only a few wide-awake and sending out their life in sweet strong odours wider and wider grew the stream until they came upon boats lying along its banks which rocked a little in the flutter of north wind's garments then came houses on the banks each standing in a lovely lawn with grand trees and in parts the river was so high that some of the grass and the roots of some of the trees were under water and diamond as they glided through between the stems could see the grass at the bottom of the water then they would leave the river and float about and over the houses one after another beautiful rich houses which like fine trees had taken centuries to grow there was scarcely a light to be seen and not a movement to be heard  all the people in them lay fast asleep  what a lot of dreams they must be dreaming said diamond  yes returned north wind they can't surely be all lies can they  i should think it depends a little on who dreams them suggested diamond  yes said north wind the people who think lies and do lies are very likely to dream lies but the people who love what is true will surely now and then dream true things but then something depends on whether the dreams are home-grown or whether the seed of them is blown over somebody else's garden-wall ah there's some one awake in this house  they were floating past a window in which a light was burning diamond heard a moan and looked up anxiously in north wind's face  it's a lady said north wind she can't sleep for pain  couldn't you do something for her said diamond  no i can't but you could  what could i do  sing a little song to her  she wouldn't hear me  i will take you in and then she will hear you  but that would be rude wouldn't it you can go where you please of course but i should have no business in her room  you may trust me diamond i shall take as good care of the lady as of you the window is open come  by a shaded lamp a lady was seated in a white wrapper trying to read but moaning every minute north wind floated behind her chair set diamond down and told him to sing something he was a little frightened but he thought a while and then sang               the sun is gone down            and the moon's in the sky            but the sun will come up            and the moon be laid by             the flower is asleep            but it is not dead            when the morning shines            it will lift its head             when winter comes            it will die no no            it will only hide            from the frost and the snow             sure is the summer            sure is the sun            the night and the winter            are shadows that run  the lady never lifted her eyes from her book or her head from her hand  as soon as diamond had finished north wind lifted him and carried him away  didn't the lady hear me asked diamond when they were once more floating down the river  oh yes she heard you answered north wind  was she frightened then  oh no  why didn't she look to see who it was  she didn't know you were there  how could she hear me then  she didn't hear you with her ears  what did she hear me with  with her heart  where did she think the words came from  she thought they came out of the book she was reading she will search all through it to-morrow to find them and won't be able to understand it at all  oh what fun said diamond what will she do  i can tell you what she won't do  she'll never forget the meaning of them and she'll never be able to remember the words of them  if she sees them in mr raymond's book it will puzzle her won't it  yes that it will she will never be able to understand it  until she gets to the back of the north wind suggested diamond  until she gets to the back of the north wind assented the lady  oh cried diamond i know now where we are oh do let me go into the old garden and into mother's room and diamond's stall i wonder if the hole is at the back of my bed still i should like to stay there all the rest of the night it won't take you long to get home from here will it north wind  no she answered you shall stay as long as you like  oh how jolly cried diamond as north wind sailed over the house with him and set him down on the lawn at the back  diamond ran about the lawn for a little while in the moonlight he found part of it cut up into flower-beds and the little summer-house with the coloured glass and the great elm-tree gone he did not like this and ran into the stable there were no horses there at all he ran upstairs the rooms were empty the only thing left that he cared about was the hole in the wall where his little bed had stood and that was not enough to make him wish to stop he ran down the stair again and out upon the lawn there he threw himself down and began to cry it was all so dreary and lost  i thought i liked the place so much said diamond to himself but i find i don't care about it i suppose it's only the people in it that make you like a place and when they're gone it's dead and you don't care a bit about it north wind told me i might stop as long as i liked and i've stopped longer already north wind he cried aloud turning his face towards the sky  the moon was under a cloud and all was looking dull and dismal a star shot from the sky and fell in the grass beside him the moment it lighted there stood north wind  oh cried diamond joyfully were you the shooting star  yes my child  did you hear me call you then  yes  so high up as that  yes i heard you quite well  do take me home  have you had enough of your old home already  yes more than enough it isn't a home at all now  i thought that would be it said north wind everything dreaming and all has got a soul in it or else it's worth nothing and we don't care a bit about it some of our thoughts are worth nothing because they've got no soul in them the brain puts them into the mind not the mind into the brain  but how can you know about that north wind you haven't got a body  if i hadn't you wouldn't know anything about me no creature can know another without the help of a body but i don't care to talk about that it is time for you to go home  so saying north wind lifted diamond and bore him away     chapter xxxviii at the back of the north wind   i did not see diamond for a week or so after this and then he told me what i have now told you i should have been astonished at his being able even to report such conversations as he said he had had with north wind had i not known already that some children are profound in metaphysics but a fear crosses me lest by telling so much about my friend i should lead people to mistake him for one of those consequential priggish little monsters who are always trying to say clever things and looking to see whether people appreciate them when a child like that dies instead of having a silly book written about him he should be stuffed like one of those awful big-headed fishes you see in museums but diamond never troubled his head about what people thought of him he never set up for knowing better than others the wisest things he said came out when he wanted one to help him with some difficulty he was in he was not even offended with nanny and jim for calling him a silly he supposed there was something in it though he could not quite understand what i suspect however that the other name they gave him god's baby had some share in reconciling him to it  happily for me i was as much interested in metaphysics as diamond himself and therefore while he recounted his conversations with north wind i did not find myself at all in a strange sea although certainly i could not always feel the bottom being indeed convinced that the bottom was miles away  could it be all dreaming do you think sir he asked anxiously  i daren't say diamond i answered but at least there is one thing you may be sure of that there is a still better love than that of the wonderful being you call north wind even if she be a dream the dream of such a beautiful creature could not come to you by chance  yes i know returned diamond i know  then he was silent but i confess appeared more thoughtful than satisfied  the next time i saw him he looked paler than usual  have you seen your friend again i asked him  yes he answered solemnly  did she take you out with her  no she did not speak to me i woke all at once as i generally do when i am going to see her and there she was against the door into the big room sitting just as i saw her sit on her own doorstep as white as snow and her eyes as blue as the heart of an iceberg she looked at me but never moved or spoke  weren't you afraid i asked  no why should i have been he answered i only felt a little cold  did she stay long  i don't know i fell asleep again i think i have been rather cold ever since though he added with a smile  i did not quite like this but i said nothing  four days after i called again at the mound the maid who opened the door looked grave but i suspected nothing when i reached the drawing-room i saw mrs raymond had been crying  haven't you heard she said seeing my questioning looks  i've heard nothing i answered  this morning we found our dear little diamond lying on the floor of the big attic-room just outside his own door fast asleep as we thought but when we took him up we did not think he was asleep we saw that    here the kind-hearted lady broke out crying afresh  may i go and see him i asked  yes she sobbed you know your way to the top of the tower  i walked up the winding stair and entered his room a lovely figure as white and almost as clear as alabaster was lying on the bed i saw at once how it was they thought he was dead i knew that he had gone to the back of the north wind,At the Back of the North Wind,George MacDonald
the light princess   contents     1  what no children    2  won't i just    3  she can't be ours    4  where is she    5  what is to be done    6  she laughs too much    7  try metaphysics    8  try a drop of water    9  put me in again   10  look at the moon   11  hiss   12  where is the prince   13  here i am   14  this is very kind of you   15  look at the rain     1  what no children   once upon a time so long ago that i have quite forgotten the date there lived a king and queen who had no children  and the king said to himself all the queens of my acquaintance have children some three some seven and some as many as twelve and my queen has not one  i feel ill-used  so he made up his mind to be cross with his wife about it  but she bore it all like a good patient queen as she was  then the king grew very cross indeed  but the queen pretended to take it all as a joke and a very good one too  why don't you have any daughters at least said he  i don't say sons that might be too much to expect  i am sure dear king i am very sorry said the queen  so you ought to be retorted the king you are not going to make a virtue of that surely  but he was not an ill-tempered king and in any matter of less moment would have let the queen have her own way with all his heart  this however was an affair of state  the queen smiled  you must have patience with a lady you know dear king said she  she was indeed a very nice queen and heartily sorry that she could not oblige the king immediately    2  won't i just  the king tried to have patience but he succeeded very badly  it was more than he deserved therefore when at last the queen gave him a daughter as lovely a little princess as ever cried  the day drew near when the infant must be christened  the king wrote all the invitations with his own hand  of course somebody was forgotten  now it does not generally matter if somebody is forgotten only you must mind who  unfortunately the king forgot without intending to forget and so the chance fell upon the princess makemnoit which was awkward  for the princess was the king's own sister and he ought not to have forgotten her  but she had made herself so disagreeable to the old king their father that he had forgotten her in making his will and so it was no wonder that her brother forgot her in writing his invitations  but poor relations don't do anything to keep you in mind of them  why don't they  the king could not see into the garret she lived in could he  she was a sour spiteful creature  the wrinkles of contempt crossed the wrinkles of peevishness and made her face as full of wrinkles as a pat of butter  if ever a king could be justified in forgetting anybody this king was justified in forgetting his sister even at a christening  she looked very odd too  her forehead was as large as all the rest of her face and projected over it like a precipice  when she was angry her little eyes flashed blue  when she hated anybody they shone yellow and green  what they looked like when she loved anybody i do not know for i never heard of her loving anybody but herself and i do not think she could have managed that if she had not somehow got used to herself  but what made it highly imprudent in the king to forget her was that she was awfully clever  in fact she was a witch and when she bewitched anybody he very soon had enough of it for she beat all the wicked fairies in wickedness and all the clever ones in cleverness  she despised all the modes we read of in history in which offended fairies and witches have taken their revenges and therefore after waiting and waiting in vain for an invitation she made up her mind at last to go without one and make the whole family miserable like a princess as she was  so she put on her best gown went to the palace was kindly received by the happy monarch who forgot that he had forgotten her and took her place in the procession to the royal chapel  when they were all gathered about the font she contrived to get next to it and throw something into the water after which she maintained a very respectful demeanour till the water was applied to the child's face  but at that moment she turned round in her place three times and muttered the following words loud enough for those beside her to hear      light of spirit by my charms   light of body every part   never weary human arms    only crush thy parents' heart   they all thought she had lost her wits and was repeating some foolish nursery rhyme but a shudder went through the whole of them notwithstanding  the baby on the contrary began to laugh and crow while the nurse gave a start and a smothered cry for she thought she was struck with paralysis  she could not feel the baby in her arms but she clasped it tight and said nothing  the mischief was done    3  she can't be ours  her atrocious aunt had deprived the child of all her gravity  if you ask me how this was effected i answer in the easiest way in the world  she had only to destroy gravitation  for the princess was a philosopher and knew all the ins and outs of the laws of gravitation as well as the ins and outs of her boot-lace  and being a witch as well she could abrogate those laws in a moment or at least so clog their wheels and rust their bearings that they would not work at all but we have more to do with what followed than with how it was done  the first awkwardness that resulted from this unhappy privation was that the moment the nurse began to float the baby up and down she flew from her arms towards the ceiling  happily the resistance of the air brought her ascending career to a close within a foot of it  there she remained horizontal as when she left her nurse's arms kicking and laughing amazingly  the nurse in terror flew to the bell and begged the footman who answered it to bring up the house-steps directly trembling in every limb she climbed upon the steps and had to stand upon the very top and reach up before she could catch the floating tail of the baby's long clothes  when the strange fact came to be known there was a terrible commotion in the palace  the occasion of its discovery by the king was naturally a repetition of the nurse's experience  astonished that he felt no weight when the child was laid in his arms he began to wave her up and not down for she slowly ascended to the ceiling as before and there remained floating in perfect comfort and satisfaction as was testified by her peals of tiny laughter  the king stood staring up in speechless amazement and trembled so that his beard shook like grass in the wind at last turning to the queen who was just as horror-struck as himself he said gasping staring and stammering   she can't be ours queen  now the queen was much cleverer than the king and had begun already to suspect that this effect defective came by cause  i am sure she is ours answered she  but we ought to have taken better care of her at the christening  people who were never invited ought not to have been present  oh ho said the king tapping his forehead with his forefinger i have it all  i've found her out  don't you see it queen  princess makemnoit has bewitched her that's just what i say answered the queen  i beg your pardon my love i did not hear you john bring the steps i get on my throne with  for he was a little king with a great throne like many other kings  the throne-steps were brought and set upon the dining-table and john got upon the top of them  but he could not reach the little princess who lay like a baby-laughter-cloud in the air exploding continuously take the tongs john said his majesty and getting up on the table he handed them to him  john could reach the baby now and the little princess was handed down by the tongs    4  where is she  one fine summer day a month after these her first adventures during which time she had been very carefully watched the princess was lying on the bed in the queen's own chamber fast asleep  one of the windows was open for it was noon and the day was so sultry that the little girl was wrapped in nothing less ethereal than slumber itself  the queen came into the room and not observing that the baby was on the bed opened another window  a frolicsome fairy wind which had been watching for a chance of mischief rushed in at the one window and taking its way over the bed where the child was lying caught her up and rolling and floating her along like a piece of flue or a dandelion seed carried her with it through the opposite window and away  the queen went down-stairs quite ignorant of the loss she had herself occasioned  when the nurse returned she supposed that her majesty had carried her off and dreading a scolding delayed making inquiry about her  but hearing nothing she grew uneasy and went at length to the queen's boudoir where she found her majesty  please your majesty shall i take the baby said she  where is she asked the queen  please forgive me  i know it was wrong  what do you mean said the queen looking grave  oh don't frighten me your majesty exclaimed the nurse clasping her hands  the queen saw that something was amiss and fell down in a faint  the nurse rushed about the palace screaming my baby my baby  every one ran to the queen's room  but the queen could give no orders they soon found out however that the princess was missing and in a moment the palace was like a beehive in a garden and in one minute more the queen was brought to herself by a great shout and a clapping of hands  they had found the princess fast asleep under a rose-bush to which the elvish little wind-puff had carried her finishing its mischief by shaking a shower of red rose-leaves all over the little white sleeper  startled by the noise the servants made she woke and furious with glee scattered the rose-leaves in all directions like a shower of spray in the sunset  she was watched more carefully after this no doubt yet it would be endless to relate all the odd incidents resulting from this peculiarity of the young princess  but there never was a baby in a house not to say a palace that kept the household in such constant good humour at least below-stairs  if it was not easy for her nurses to hold her at least she made neither their arms nor their hearts ache  and she was so nice to play at ball with  there was positively no danger of letting her fall  they might throw her down or knock her down or push her down but couldn't let her down  it is true they might let her fly into the fire or the coal-hole or through the window but none of these accidents had happened as yet  if you heard peals of laughter resounding from some unknown region you might be sure enough of the cause  going down into the kitchen or the room you would find jane and thomas and robert and susan all and sum playing at ball with the little princess  she was the ball herself and did not enjoy it the less for that  away she went flying from one to another screeching with laughter  and the servants loved the ball itself better even than the game  but they had to take some care how they threw her for if she received an upward direction she would never come down again without being fetched    5  what is to be done  but above-stairs it was different  one day for instance after breakfast the king went into his counting-house and counted out his money  the operation gave him no pleasure  to think said he to himself that every one of these gold sovereigns weighs a quarter of an ounce and my real live flesh-and-blood princess weighs nothing at all  and he hated his gold sovereigns as they lay with a broad smile of self-satisfaction all over their yellow faces  the queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey  but at the second mouthful she burst out crying and could not swallow it  the king heard her sobbing  glad of anybody but especially of his queen to quarrel with he clashed his gold sovereigns into his money-box clapped his crown on his head and rushed into the parlour  what is all this about exclaimed he  what are you crying for queen  i can't eat it said the queen looking ruefully at the honey-pot  no wonder retorted the king  you've just eaten your breakfast two turkey eggs and three anchovies  oh that's not it sobbed her majesty  it's my child my child  well what's the matter with your child  she's neither up the chimney nor down the draw-well  just hear her laughing  yet the king could not help a sigh which he tried to turn into a cough saying   it is a good thing to be light-hearted i am sure whether she be ours or not  it is a bad thing to be light-headed answered the queen looking with prophetic soul far into the future  'tis a good thing to be light-handed said the king  'tis a bad thing to be light-fingered answered the queen  'tis a good thing to be light-footed said the king  'tis a bad thing  began the queen but the king interrupted her  in fact said he with the tone of one who concludes an argument in which he has had only imaginary opponents and in which therefore he has come off triumphant in fact it is a good thing altogether to be light-bodied  but it is a bad thing altogether to be light-minded retorted the queen who was beginning to lose her temper  this last answer quite discomfited his majesty who turned on his heel and betook himself to his counting-house again  but he was not half-way towards it when the voice of his queen overtook him  and it's a bad thing to be light-haired screamed she determined to have more last words now that her spirit was roused  the queen's hair was black as night and the king's had been and his daughter's was golden as morning  but it was not this reflection on his hair that arrested him it was the double use of the word light for the king hated all witticisms and punning especially  and besides he could not tell whether the queen meant light-haired or light-heired for why might she not aspirate her vowels when she was exasperated herself  he turned upon his other heel and rejoined her  she looked angry still because she knew that she was guilty or what was much the same knew that he thought so  my dear queen said he duplicity of any sort is exceedingly objectionable between married people of any rank not to say kings and queens and the most objectionable form duplicity can assume is that of punning  there said the queen i never made a jest but i broke it in the making  i am the most unfortunate woman in the world  she looked so rueful that the king took her in his arms and they sat down to consult  can you bear this said the king  no i can't said the queen  well what's to be done said the king  i'm sure i don't know said the queen  but might you not try an apology  to my old sister i suppose you mean said the king  yes said the queen  well i don't mind said the king  so he went the next morning to the house of the princess and making a very humble apology begged her to undo the spell  but the princess declared with a grave face that she knew nothing at all about it her eyes however shone pink which was a sign that she was happy she advised the king and queen to have patience and to mend their ways  the king returned disconsolate  the queen tried to comfort him  we will wait till she is older  she may then be able to suggest something herself  she will know at least how she feels and explain things to us  but what if she should marry exclaimed the king in sudden consternation at the idea  well what of that rejoined the queen  just think  if she were to have children  in the course of a hundred years the air might be as full of floating children as of gossamers in autumn  that is no business of ours replied the queen  besides by that time they will have learned to take care of themselves  a sigh was the king's only answer  he would have consulted the court physicians but he was afraid they would try experiments upon her    6  she laughs too much  meantime notwithstanding awkward occurrences and griefs that she brought upon her parents the little princess laughed and grew not fat but plump and tall  she reached the age of seventeen without having fallen into any worse scrape than a chimney by rescuing her from which a little bird-nesting urchin got fame and a black face nor thoughtless as she was had she committed anything worse than laughter at everybody and everything that came in her way  when she was told for the sake of experiment that general clanrunfort was cut to pieces with all his troops she laughed when she heard that the enemy was on his way to besiege her papa's capital she laughed hugely but when she was told that the city would certainly be abandoned to the mercy of the enemy's soldiery why then she laughed immoderately  she never could be brought to see the serious side of anything  when her mother cried she said   what queer faces mamma makes  and she squeezes water out of her cheeks  funny mamma  and when her papa stormed at her she laughed and danced round and round him clapping her hands and crying   do it again papa  do it again  it's such fun  dear funny papa  and if he tried to catch her she glided from him in an instant not in the least afraid of him but thinking it part of the game not to be caught  with one push of her foot she would be floating in the air above his head or she would go dancing backwards and forwards and sideways like a great butterfly  it happened several times when her father and mother were holding a consultation about her in private that they were interrupted by vainly repressed outbursts of laughter over their heads and looking up with indignation saw her floating at full length in the air above them whence she regarded them with the most comical appreciation of the position  one day an awkward accident happened  the princess had come out upon the lawn with one of her attendants who held her by the hand  spying her father at the other side of the lawn she snatched her hand from the maid's and sped across to him  now when she wanted to run alone her custom was to catch up a stone in each hand so that she might come down again after a bound  whatever she wore as part of her attire had no effect in this way  even gold when it thus became as it were a part of herself lost all its weight for the time  but whatever she only held in her hands retained its downward tendency  on this occasion she could see nothing to catch up but a huge toad that was walking across the lawn as if he had a hundred years to do it in  not knowing what disgust meant for this was one of her peculiarities she snatched up the toad and bounded away  she had almost reached her father and he was holding out his arms to receive her and take from her lips the kiss which hovered on them like a butterfly on a rosebud when a puff of wind blew her aside into the arms of a young page who had just been receiving a message from his majesty  now it was no great peculiarity in the princess that once she was set agoing it always cost her time and trouble to check herself  on this occasion there was no time  she must kiss-and she kissed the page  she did not mind it much for she had no shyness in her composition and she knew besides that she could not help it  so she only laughed like a musical box  the poor page fared the worst  for the princess trying to correct the unfortunate tendency of the kiss put out her hands to keep her off the page so that along with the kiss he received on the other cheek a slap with the huge black toad which she poked right into his eye  he tried to laugh too but the attempt resulted in such an odd contortion of countenance as showed that there was no danger of his pluming himself on the kiss  as for the king his dignity was greatly hurt and he did not speak to the page for a whole month  i may here remark that it was very amusing to see her run if her mode of progression could properly be called running  for first she would make a bound then having alighted she would run a few steps and make another bound  sometimes she would fancy she had reached the ground before she actually had and her feet would go backwards and forwards running upon nothing at all like those of a chicken on its back  then she would laugh like the very spirit of fun only in her laugh there was something missing  what it was i find myself unable to describe  i think it was a certain tone depending upon the possibility of sorrow morbidezza perhaps  she never smiled    7  try metaphysics  after a long avoidance of the painful subject the king and queen resolved to hold a council of three upon it and so they sent for the princess  in she came sliding and flitting and gliding from one piece of furniture to another and put herself at last in an armchair in a sitting posture  whether she could be said to sit seeing she received no support from the seat of the chair i do not pretend to determine  my dear child said the king you must be aware by this time that you are not exactly like other people  oh you dear funny papa  i have got a nose and two eyes and all the rest  so have you  so has mamma  now be serious my dear for once said the queen  no thank you mamma i had rather not  would you not like to be able to walk like other people said the king  no indeed i should think not  you only crawl  you are such slow coaches  how do you feel my child he resumed after a pause of discomfiture  quite well thank you  i mean what do you feel like  like nothing at all that i know of  you must feel like something  i feel like a princess with such a funny papa and such a dear pet of a queen-mamma  now really began the queen but the princess interrupted her  oh yes she added i remember  i have a curious feeling sometimes as if i were the only person that had any sense in the whole world  she had been trying to behave herself with dignity but now she burst into a violent fit of laughter threw herself backwards over the chair and went rolling about the floor in an ecstasy of enjoyment  the king picked her up easier than one does a down quilt and replaced her in her former relation to the chair  the exact preposition expressing this relation i do not happen to know  is there nothing you wish for resumed the king who had learned by this time that it was useless to be angry with her  oh you dear papa yes answered she  what is it my darling  i have been longing for it oh such a time ever since last night tell me what it is  will you promise to let me have it  the king was on the point of saying yes but the wiser queen checked him with a single motion of her head  tell me what it is first said he  no no  promise first  i dare not  what is it  mind i hold you to your promise it is to be tied to the end of a string a very long string indeed and be flown like a kite  oh such fun  i would rain rose-water and hail sugar-plums and snow whipped-cream and and and   a fit of laughing checked her and she would have been off again over the floor had not the king started up and caught her just in time seeing nothing but talk could be got out of her he rang the bell and sent her away with two of her ladies-in-waiting  now queen he said turning to her majesty what is to be done  there is but one thing left answered she  let us consult the college of metaphysicians  bravo cried the king we will  now at the head of this college were two very wise chinese philosophers-by name hum-drum and kopy-keck  for them the king sent and straightway they came  in a long speech he communicated to them what they knew very well already as who did not namely the peculiar condition of his daughter in relation to the globe on which she dwelt and requested them to consult together as to what might be the cause and probable cure of her infirmity  the king laid stress upon the word but failed to discover his own pun  the queen laughed but hum-drum and kopy-keck heard with humility and retired in silence  the consultation consisted chiefly in propounding and supporting for the thousandth time each his favourite theories  for the condition of the princess afforded delightful scope for the discussion of every question arising from the division of thought-in fact of all the metaphysics of the chinese empire  but it is only justice to say that they did not altogether neglect the discussion of the practical question what was to be done  hum-drum was a materialist and kopy-keck was a spiritualist  the former was slow and sententious the latter was quick and flighty  the latter had generally the first word the former the last  i reassert my former assertion began kopy-keck with a plunge there is not a fault in the princess body or soul only they are wrong put together  listen to me now hum-drum and i will tell you in brief what i think  don't speak  don't answer me  i won't hear you till i have done   at that decisive moment when souls seek their appointed habitations two eager souls met struck rebounded lost their way and arrived each at the wrong place  the soul of the princess was one of those and she went far astray  she does not belong by rights to this world at all but to some other planet probably mercury  her proclivity to her true sphere destroys all the natural influence which this orb would otherwise possess over her corporeal frame  she cares for nothing here  there is no relation between her and this world  she must therefore be taught by the sternest compulsion to take an interest in the earth as the earth  she must study every department of its history its animal history its vegetable history its mineral history its social history its moral history its political history its scientific history its literary history its musical history its artistical history above all its metaphysical history  she must begin with the chinese dynasty and end with japan  but first of all she must study geology and especially the history of the extinct races of animals-their natures their habits their loves their hates their revenges  she must   hold h-o-o-old roared hum-drum  it is certainly my turn now  my rooted and insubvertible conviction is that the causes of the anomalies evident in the princess's condition are strictly and solely physical  but that is only tantamount to acknowledging that they exist  hear my opinion   from some cause or other of no importance to our inquiry the motion of her heart has been reversed  that remarkable combination of the suction and the force-pump works the wrong way-i mean in the case of the unfortunate princess  it draws in where it should force out and forces out where it should draw in  the offices of the auricles and the ventricles are subverted  the blood is sent forth by the veins and returns by the arteries  consequently it is running the wrong way through all her corporeal organism lungs and all  is it then at all mysterious seeing that such is the case that on the other particular of gravitation as well she should differ from normal humanity  my proposal for the cure is this    phlebotomize until she is reduced to the last point of safety  let it be effected if necessary in a warm bath  when she is reduced to a state of perfect asphyxy apply a ligature to the left ankle drawing it as tight as the bone will bear  apply at the same moment another of equal tension around the right wrist  by means of plates constructed for the purpose place the other foot and hand under the receivers of two air-pumps  exhaust the receivers  exhibit a pint of french brandy and await the result  which would presently arrive in the form of grim death said kopy-keck  if it should she would yet die in doing our duty retorted hum-drum  but their majesties had too much tenderness for their volatile offspring to subject her to either of the schemes of the equally unscrupulous philosophers  indeed the most complete knowledge of the laws of nature would have been unserviceable in her case for it was impossible to classify her  she was a fifth imponderable body sharing all the other properties of the ponderable    8  try a drop of water  perhaps the best thing for the princess would have been to fall in love  but how a princess who had no gravity could fall into anything is a difficulty perhaps the difficulty  as for her own feelings on the subject she did not even know that there was such a beehive of honey and stings to be fallen into  but now i come to mention another curious fact about her  the palace was built on the shores of the loveliest lake in the world and the princess loved this lake more than father or mother  the root of this preference no doubt although the princess did not recognise it as such was that the moment she got into it she recovered the natural right of which she had been so wickedly deprived namely gravity  whether this was owing to the fact that water had been employed as the means of conveying the injury i do not know  but it is certain that she could swim and dive like the duck that her old nurse said she was  the manner in which this alleviation of her misfortune was discovered was as follows  one summer evening during the carnival of the country she had been taken upon the lake by the king and queen in the royal barge  they were accompanied by many of the courtiers in a fleet of little boats in the middle of the lake she wanted to get into the lord chancellor's barge for his daughter who was a great favourite with her was in it with her father  now though the old king rarely condescended to make light of his misfortune yet happening on this occasion to be in a particularly good humour as the barges approached each other he caught up the princess to throw her into the chancellor's barge  he lost his balance however and dropping into the bottom of the barge lost his hold of his daughter not however before imparting to her the downward tendency of his own person though in a somewhat different direction for as the king fell into the boat she fell into the water  with a burst of delighted laughter she disappeared in the lake a cry of horror ascended from the boats  they had never seen the princess go down before  half the men were under water in a moment but they had all one after another come up to the surface again for breath when tinkle tinkle babble and gush came the princess's laugh over the water from far away  there she was swimming like a swan  nor would she come out for king or queen chancellor or daughter  she was perfectly obstinate  but at the same time she seemed more sedate than usual  perhaps that was because a great pleasure spoils laughing  at all events after this the passion of her life was to get into the water and she was always the better behaved and the more beautiful the more she had of it  summer and winter it was quite the same only she could not stay so long in the water when they had to break the ice to let her in  any day from morning till evening in summer she might be descried a streak of white in the blue water lying as still as the shadow of a cloud or shooting along like a dolphin disappearing and coming up again far off just where one did not expect her  she would have been in the lake of a night too if she could have had her way for the balcony of her window overhung a deep pool in it and through a shallow reedy passage she could have swum out into the wide wet water and no one would have been any the wiser  indeed when she happened to wake in the moonlight she could hardly resist the temptation  but there was the sad difficulty of getting into it  she had as great a dread of the air as some children have of the water  for the slightest gust of wind would blow her away and a gust might arise in the stillest moment and if she gave herself a push towards the water and just failed of reaching it her situation would be dreadfully awkward irrespective of the wind for at best there she would have to remain suspended in her nightgown till she was seen and angled for by someone from the window  oh if i had my gravity thought she contemplating the water i would flash off this balcony like a long white sea-bird headlong into the darling wetness  heigh-ho  this was the only consideration that made her wish to be like other people  another reason for her being fond of the water was that in it alone she enjoyed any freedom  for she could not walk out without a cortege consisting in part of a troop of light horse for fear of the liberties which the wind might take with her  and the king grew more apprehensive with increasing years till at last he would not allow her to walk abroad at all without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many parts of her dress and held by twenty noblemen  of course horseback was out of the question  but she bade good-by to all this ceremony when she got into the water  and so remarkable were its effects upon her especially in restoring her for the time to the ordinary human gravity that hum-drum and kopy-keck agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three years in the hope that as the water did her so much good the earth would do her yet more  but the king had some vulgar prejudices against the experiment and would not give his consent  foiled in this they yet agreed in another recommendation which seeing that one imported his opinions from china and the other from thibet was very remarkable indeed  they argued that if water of external origin and application could be so efficacious water from a deeper source might work a perfect cure in short that if the poor afflicted princess could by any means be made to cry she might recover her lost gravity  but how was this to be brought about  therein lay all the difficulty to meet which the philosophers were not wise enough  to make the princess cry was as impossible as to make her weigh  they sent for a professional beggar commanded him to prepare his most touching oracle of woe helped him out of the court charade box to whatever he wanted for dressing up and promised great rewards in the event of his success  but it was all in vain  she listened to the mendicant artist's story and gazed at his marvellous make up till she could contain herself no longer and went into the most undignified contortions for relief shrieking positively screeching with laughter  when she had a little recovered herself she ordered her attendants to drive him away and not give him a single copper whereupon his look of mortified discomfiture wrought her punishment and his revenge for it sent her into violent hysterics from which she was with difficulty recovered  but so anxious was the king that the suggestion should have a fair trial that he put himself in a rage one day and rushing up to her room gave her an awful whipping  yet not a tear would flow  she looked grave and her laughing sounded uncommonly like screaming that was all  the good old tyrant though he put on his best gold spectacles to look could not discover the smallest cloud in the serene blue of her eyes    9  put me in again  it must have been about this time that the son of a king who lived a thousand miles from lagobel set out to look for the daughter of a queen  he travelled far and wide but as sure as he found a princess he found some fault in her  of course he could not marry a mere woman however beautiful and there was no princess to be found worthy of him whether the prince was so near perfection that he had a right to demand perfection itself i cannot pretend to say  all i know is that he was a fine handsome brave generous well-bred and well-behaved youth as all princes are  in his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess but as everybody said she was bewitched he never dreamed that she could bewitch him  for what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity  who could tell what she might not lose next  she might lose her visibility or her tangibility or in short the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium so that he should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive  of course he made no further inquiries about her  one day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest  these forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers like a sieve that keeps back the bran then the princes get away to follow their fortunes  in this way they have the advantage of the princesses who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun  i wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes  one lovely evening after wandering about for many days he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them and he soon came upon a kind of heath  next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood but by this time it was getting late and there was nobody in the fields to direct him  after travelling for another hour his horse quite worn out with long labour and lack of food fell and was unable to rise again  so he continued his journey on foot  at length he entered another wood not a wild forest but a civilized wood through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake  along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness  suddenly he paused and listened strange sounds came across the water  it was in fact the princess laughing  now there was something odd in her laugh as i have already hinted for the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming  looking over the lake he saw something white in the water and in an instant he had torn off his tunic kicked off his sandals and plunged in  he soon reached the white object and found that it was a woman  there was not light enough to show that she was a princess but quite enough to show that she was a lady for it does not want much light to see that  now i cannot tell how it came about whether she pretended to be drowning or whether he frightened her or caught her so as to embarrass her but certainly he brought her to shore in a fashion ignominious to a swimmer and more nearly drowned than she had ever expected to be for the water had got into her throat as often as she had tried to speak  at the place to which he bore her the bank was only a foot or two above the water so he gave her a strong lift out of the water to lay her on the bank  but her gravitation ceasing the moment she left the water away she went up into the air scolding and screaming  you naughty naughty naughty naughty man she cried  no one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before when the prince saw her ascend he thought he must have been bewitched and have mistaken a great swan for a lady  but the princess caught hold of the topmost cone upon a lofty fir  this came off but she caught at another and in fact stopped herself by gathering cones dropping them as the stalks gave way  the prince meantime stood in the water staring and forgetting to get out  but the princess disappearing he scrambled on shore and went in the direction of the tree  there he found her climbing down one of the branches towards the stem  but in the darkness of the wood the prince continued in some bewilderment as to what the phenomenon could be until reaching the ground and seeing him standing there she caught hold of him and said   i'll tell papa  oh no you won't returned the prince  yes i will she persisted  what business had you to pull me down out of the water and throw me to the bottom of the air  i never did you any harm  pardon me  i did not mean to hurt you  i don't believe you have any brains and that is a worse loss than your wretched gravity  i pity you  the prince now saw that he had come upon the bewitched princess and had already offended her  but before he could think what to say next she burst out angrily giving a stamp with her foot that would have sent her aloft again but for the hold she had of his arm   put me up directly  put you up where you beauty asked the prince  he had fallen in love with her almost already for her anger made her more charming than any one else had ever beheld her and as far as he could see which certainly was not far she had not a single fault about her except of course that she had not any gravity  no prince however would judge of a princess by weight  the loveliness of her foot he would hardly estimate by the depth of the impression it could make in mud  put you up where you beauty asked the prince  in the water you stupid answered the princess  come then said the prince  the condition of her dress increasing her usual difficulty in walking compelled her to cling to him and he could hardly persuade himself that he was not in a delightful dream notwithstanding the torrent of musical abuse with which she overwhelmed him  the prince being therefore in no hurry they came upon the lake at quite another part where the bank was twenty-five feet high at least and when they had reached the edge he turned towards the princess and said   how am i to put you in that is your business she answered quite snappishly  you took me out put me in again  very well said the prince and catching her up in his arms he sprang with her from the rock  the princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them  when they came to the surface she found that for a moment or two she could not even laugh for she had gone down with such a rush that it was with difficulty she recovered her breath  the instant they reached the surface   how do you like falling in said the prince  after some effort the princess panted out   is that what you call falling in  yes answered the prince i should think it a very tolerable specimen  it seemed to me like going up rejoined she  my feeling was certainly one of elevation too the prince conceded  the princess did not appear to understand him for she retorted his question    how do you like falling in said the princess  beyond everything answered he for i have fallen in with the only perfect creature i ever saw  no more of that  i am tired of it said the princess  perhaps she shared her father's aversion to punning  don't you like falling in then said the prince  it is the most delightful fun i ever had in my life answered she i never fell before  i wish i could learn  to think i am the only person in my father's kingdom that can't fall  here the poor princess looked almost sad  i shall be most happy to fall in with you any time you like said the prince devotedly  thank you  i don't know  perhaps it would not be proper  but i don't care  at all events as we have fallen in let us have a swim together  with all my heart responded the prince  and away they went swimming and diving and floating until at last they heard cries along the shore and saw lights glancing in all directions  it was now quite late and there was no moon  i must go home said the princess  i am very sorry for this is delightful  so am i returned the prince  but i am glad i haven't a home to go to at least i don't exactly know where it is  i wish i hadn't one either rejoined the princess it is so stupid i have a great mind she continued to play them all a trick  why couldn't they leave me alone  they won't trust me in the lake for a single night you see where that green light is burning  that is the window of my room  now if you would just swim there with me very quietly and when we are all but under the balcony give me such a push up you call it-as you did a little while ago i should be able to catch hold of the balcony and get in at the window and then they may look for me till to-morrow morning  with more obedience than pleasure said the prince gallantly and away they swam very gently  will you be in the lake to-morrow night the prince ventured to ask  to be sure i will  i don't think so  perhaps was the princess's somewhat strange answer  but the prince was intelligent enough not to press her further and merely whispered as he gave her the parting lift don't tell  the only answer the princess returned was a roguish look  she was already a yard above his head  the look seemed to say never fear it is too good fun to spoil that way  so perfectly like other people had she been in the water that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly grasp the balcony and disappear through the window  he turned almost expecting to see her still by his side  but he was alone in the water  so he swam away quietly and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber  as soon as they disappeared he landed in search of his tunic and sword and after some trouble found them again  then he made the best of his way round the lake to the other side  there the wood was wilder and the shore steeper-rising more immediately towards the mountains which surrounded the lake on all sides and kept sending it messages of silvery streams from morning to night and all night long he soon found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess's room and where even in the broad daylight he would be in no danger of being discovered from the opposite shore  it was a sort of cave in the rock where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves and lay down too tired for hunger to keep him awake  all night long he dreamed that he was swimming with the princess    10  look at the moon  early the next morning the prince set out to look for something to eat which he soon found at a forester's hut where for many following days he was supplied with all that a brave prince could consider necessary and having plenty to keep him alive for the present he would not think of wants not yet in existence  whenever care intruded this prince always bowed him out in the most princely manner  when he returned from his breakfast to his watch-cave he saw the princess already floating about in the lake attended by the king and queen whom he knew by their crowns and a great company in lovely little boats with canopies of all the colours of the rainbow and flags and streamers of a great many more  it was a very bright day and soon the prince burned up with the heat began to long for the cold water and the cool princess  but he had to endure till twilight for the boats had provisions on board and it was not till the sun went down that the gay party began to vanish  boat after boat drew away to the shore following that of the king and queen till only one apparently the princess's own boat remained  but she did not want to go home even yet and the prince thought he saw her order the boat to the shore without her  at all events it rowed away and now of all the radiant company only one white speck remained  then the prince began to sing and this is what he sung      lady fair   swan-white   lift thine eyes   banish night   by the might   of thine eyes    snowy arms   oars of snow   oar her hither   plashing low   soft and slow   oar her hither    stream behind her   o'er the lake   radiant whiteness   in her wake   following following for her sake   radiant whiteness    cling about her   waters blue   part not from her   but renew   cold and true   kisses round her    lap me round   waters sad   that have left her   make me glad   for ye had   kissed her ere ye left her  before he had finished his song the princess was just under the place where he sat and looking up to find him  her ears had led her truly  would you like a fall princess said the prince looking down  ah there you are  yes if you please prince said the princess looking up  how do you know i am a prince princess said the prince  because you are a very nice young man prince said the princess  come up then princess  fetch me prince  the prince took off his scarf then his sword-belt then his tunic and tied them all together and let them down  but the line was far too short  he unwound his turban and added it to the rest when it was all but long enough and his purse completed it  the princess just managed to lay hold of the knot of money and was beside him in a moment  this rock was much higher than the other and the splash and the dive were tremendous  the princess was in ecstasies of delight and their swim was delicious  night after night they met and swam about in the dark clear lake where such was the prince's gladness that whether the princess's way of looking at things infected him or he was actually getting light-headed he often fancied that he was swimming in the sky instead of the lake  but when he talked about being in heaven the princess laughed at him dreadfully  when the moon came she brought them fresh pleasure  everything looked strange and new in her light with an old withered yet unfading newness  when the moon was nearly full one of their great delights was to dive deep in the water and then turning round look up through it at the great blot of light close above them shimmering and trembling and wavering spreading and contracting seeming to melt away and again grow solid  then they would shoot up through the blot and lo there was the moon far off clear and steady and cold and very lovely at the bottom of a deeper and bluer lake than theirs as the princess said  the prince soon found out that while in the water the princess was very like other people  and besides this she was not so forward in her questions or pert in her replies at sea as on shore  neither did she laugh so much and when she did laugh it was more gently  she seemed altogether more modest and maidenly in the water than out of it  but when the prince who had really fallen in love when he fell in the lake began to talk to her about love she always turned her head towards him and laughed  after a while she began to look puzzled as if she were trying to understand what he meant but could not revealing a notion that he meant something  but as soon as ever she left the lake she was so altered that the prince said to himself if i marry her i see no help for it  we must turn merman and mermaid and go out to sea at once    11  hiss  the princess's pleasure in the lake had grown to a passion and she could scarcely bear to be out of it for an hour  imagine then her consternation when diving with the prince one night a sudden suspicion seized her that the lake was not so deep as it used to be the prince could not imagine what had happened  she shot to the surface and without a word swam at full speed towards the higher side of the lake  he followed begging to know if she was ill or what was the matter  she never turned her head or took the smallest notice of his question  arrived at the shore she coasted the rocks with minute inspection  but she was not able to come to a conclusion for the moon was very small and so she could not see well  she turned therefore and swam home without saying a word to explain her conduct to the prince of whose presence she seemed no longer conscious  he withdrew to his cave in great perplexity and distress  next day she made many observations which alas strengthened her fears  she saw that the banks were too dry and that the grass on the shore and the trailing plants on the rocks were withering away  she caused marks to be made along the borders and examined them day after day in all directions of the wind till at last the horrible idea became a certain fact that the surface of the lake was slowly sinking  the poor princess nearly went out of the little mind she had  it was awful to her to see the lake which she loved more than any living thing lie dying before her eyes  it sank away slowly vanishing  the tops of rocks that had never been seen till now began to appear far down in the clear water  before long they were dry in the sun  it was fearful to think of the mud that would soon lie there baking and festering full of lovely creatures dying and ugly creatures coming to life like the unmaking of a world  and how hot the sun would be without any lake  she could not bear to swim in it any more and began to pine away  her life seemed bound up with it and ever as the lake sank she pined  people said she would not live an hour after the lake was gone  but she never cried  a proclamation was made to all the kingdom that whosoever should discover the cause of the lake's decrease would be rewarded after a princely fashion  hum-drum and kopy-keck applied themselves to their physics and metaphysics but in vain  not even they could suggest a cause  now the fact was that the old princess was at the root of the mischief when she heard that her niece found more pleasure in the water than any one else out of it she went into a rage and cursed herself for her want of foresight  but said she i will soon set all right  the king and the people shall die of thirst their brains shall boil and frizzle in their skulls before i will lose my revenge  and she laughed a ferocious laugh that made the hairs on the back of her black cat stand erect with terror  then she went to an old chest in the room and opening it took out what looked like a piece of dried seaweed  this she threw into a tub of water  then she threw some powder into the water and stirred it with her bare arm muttering over it words of hideous sound and yet more hideous import  then she set the tub aside and took from the chest a huge bunch of a hundred rusty keys that clattered in her shaking hands  then she sat down and proceeded to oil them all before she had finished out from the tub the water of which had kept on a slow motion ever since she had ceased stirring it came the head and half the body of a huge gray snake  but the witch did not look round  it grew out of the tub waving itself backwards and forwards with a slow horizontal motion till it reached the princess when it laid its head upon her shoulder and gave a low hiss in her ear  she started but with joy and seeing the head resting on her shoulder drew it towards her and kissed it  then she drew it all out of the tub and wound it round her body  it was one of those dreadful creatures which few have ever beheld the white snakes of darkness  then she took the keys and went down to her cellar and as she unlocked the door she said to herself   this is worth living for  locking the door behind her she descended a few steps into the cellar and crossing it unlocked another door into a dark narrow passage she locked this also behind her and descended a few more steps  if any one had followed the witch-princess he would have heard her unlock exactly one hundred doors and descend a few steps after unlocking each  when she had unlocked the last she entered a vast cave the roof of which was supported by huge natural pillars of rock  now this roof was the under side of the bottom of the lake  she then untwined the snake from her body and held it by the tail high above her  the hideous creature stretched up its head towards the roof of the cavern which it was just able to reach  it then began to move its head backwards and forwards with a slow oscillating motion as if looking for something  at the same moment the witch began to walk round and round the cavern coming nearer to the centre every circuit while the head of the snake described the same path over the roof that she did over the floor for she kept holding it up  and still it kept slowly oscillating  round and round the cavern they went ever lessening the circuit till at last the snake made a sudden dart and clung to the roof with its mouth  that's right my beauty cried the princess drain it dry  she let it go left it hanging and sat down on a great stone with her black cat which had followed her all round the cave by her side then she began to knit and mutter awful words  the snake hung like a huge leech sucking at the stone the cat stood with his back arched and his tail like a piece of cable looking up at the snake and the old woman sat and knitted and muttered  seven days and seven nights they remained thus when suddenly the serpent dropped from the roof as if exhausted and shrivelled up till it was again like a piece of dried seaweed  the witch started to her feet picked it up put it in her pocket and looked up at the roof  one drop of water was trembling on the spot where the snake had been sucking  as soon as she saw that she turned and fled followed by her cat  shutting the door in a terrible hurry she locked it and having muttered some frightful words sped to the next which also she locked and muttered over and so with all the hundred doors till she arrived in her own cellar then she sat down on the floor ready to faint but listening with malicious delight to the rushing of the water which she could hear distinctly through all the hundred doors  but this was not enough  now that she had tasted revenge she lost her patience  without further measures the lake would be too long in disappearing  so the next night with the last shred of the dying old moon rising she took some of the water in which she had revived the snake put it in a bottle and set out accompanied by her cat  before morning she had made the entire circuit of the lake muttering fearful words as she crossed every stream and casting into it some of the water out of her bottle  when she had finished the circuit she muttered yet again and flung a handful of water towards the moon thereupon every spring in the country ceased to throb and bubble dying away like the pulse of a dying man  the next day there was no sound of falling water to be heard along the borders of the lake  the very courses were dry and the mountains showed no silvery streaks down their dark sides  and not alone had the fountains of mother earth ceased to flow for all the babies throughout the country were crying dreadfully only without tears    12  where is the prince  never since the night when the princess left him so abruptly had the prince had a single interview with her  he had seen her once or twice in the lake but as far as he could discover she had not been in it any more at night  he had sat and sung and looked in vain for his nereid while she like a true nereid was wasting away with her lake sinking as it sank withering as it dried  when at length he discovered the change that was taking place in the level of the water he was in great alarm and perplexity  he could not tell whether the lake was dying because the lady had forsaken it or whether the lady would not come because the lake had begun to sink  but he resolved to know so much at least  he disguised himself and going to the palace requested to see the lord chamberlain  his appearance at once gained his request and the lord chamberlain being a man of some insight perceived that there was more in the prince's solicitation than met the ear  he felt likewise that no one could tell whence a solution of the present difficulties might arise  so he granted the prince's prayer to be made shoeblack to the princess  it was rather cunning in the prince to request such an easy post for the princess could not possibly soil as many shoes as other princesses  he soon learned all that could be told about the princess  he went nearly distracted but after roaming about the lake for days and diving in every depth that remained all that he could do was to put an extra polish on the dainty pair of boots that was never called for  for the princess kept her room with the curtains drawn to shut out the dying lake but she could not shut it out of her mind for a moment  it haunted her imagination so that she felt as if the lake were her soul drying up within her first to mud then to madness and death  she thus brooded over the change with all its dreadful accompaniments till she was nearly distracted  as for the prince she had forgotten him  however much she had enjoyed his company in the water she did not care for him without it  but she seemed to have forgotten her father and mother too  the lake went on sinking  small slimy spots began to appear which glittered steadily amidst the changeful shine of the water  these grew to broad patches of mud which widened and spread with rocks here and there and floundering fishes and crawling eels swarming  the people went everywhere catching these and looking for anything that might have dropped from the royal boats  at length the lake was all but gone only a few of the deepest pools remaining unexhausted  it happened one day that a party of youngsters found themselves on the brink of one of these pools in the very centre of the lake  it was a rocky basin of considerable depth  looking in they saw at the bottom something that shone yellow in the sun  a little boy jumped in and dived for it  it was a plate of gold covered with writing  they carried it to the king  on one side of it stood these words      death alone from death can save   love is death and so is brave    love can fill the deepest grave   love loves on beneath the wave   now this was enigmatical enough to the king and courtiers  but the reverse of the plate explained it a little  its writing amounted to this    if the lake should disappear they must find the hole through which the water ran  but it would be useless to try to stop it by any ordinary means  there was but one effectual mode the body of a living man could alone stanch the flow  the man must give himself of his own will and the lake must take his life as it filled  otherwise the offering would be of no avail  if the nation could not provide one hero it was time it should perish    13  here i am  this was a very disheartening revelation to the king not that he was unwilling to sacrifice a subject but that he was hopeless of finding a man willing to sacrifice himself  no time was to be lost however for the princess was lying motionless on her bed and taking no nourishment but lake-water which was now none of the best  therefore the king caused the contents of the wonderful plate of gold to be published throughout the country  no one however came forward  the prince having gone several days' journey into the forest to consult a hermit whom he had met there on his way to lagobel knew nothing of the oracle till his return  when he had acquainted himself with all the particulars he sat down and thought   she will die if i don't do it and life would be nothing to me without her so i shall lose nothing by doing it  and life will be as pleasant to her as ever for she will soon forget me  and there will be so much more beauty and happiness in the world to be sure i shall not see it  here the poor prince gave a sigh how lovely the lake will be in the moonlight with that glorious creature sporting in it like a wild goddess it is rather hard to be drowned by inches though  let me see that will be seventy inches of me to drown  here he tried to laugh but could not the longer the better however he resumed  for can i not bargain that the princess shall be beside me all the time  so i shall see her once more kiss her perhaps who knows and die looking in her eyes  it will be no death  at least i shall not feel it  and to see the lake filling for the beauty again all right i am ready  he kissed the princess's boot laid it down and hurried to the king's apartment  but feeling as he went that anything sentimental would be disagreeable he resolved to carry off the whole affair with nonchalance  so he knocked at the door of the king's counting-house where it was all but a capital crime to disturb him  when the king heard the knock he started up and opened the door in a rage  seeing only the shoeblack he drew his sword  this i am sorry to say was his usual mode of asserting his regality when he thought his dignity was in danger  but the prince was not in the least alarmed  please your majesty i'm your butler said he  my butler you lying rascal  what do you mean  i mean i will cork your big bottle  is the fellow mad bawled the king raising the point of his sword  i will put a stopper plug what you call it in your leaky lake grand monarch said the prince  the king was in such a rage that before he could speak he had time to cool and to reflect that it would be great waste to kill the only man who was willing to be useful in the present emergency seeing that in the end the insolent fellow would be as dead as if he had died by his majesty's own hand  oh said he at last putting up his sword with difficulty it was so long i am obliged to you you young fool  take a glass of wine  no thank you replied the prince  very well said the king  would you like to run and see your parents before you make your experiment  no thank you said the prince  then we will go and look for the hole at once said his majesty and proceeded to call some attendants  stop please your majesty i have a condition to make interposed the prince  what exclaimed the king a condition and with me  how dare you  as you please returned the prince coolly  i wish your majesty a good morning  you wretch  i will have you put in a sack and stuck in the hole  very well your majesty replied the prince becoming a little more respectful lest the wrath of the king should deprive him of the pleasure of dying for the princess  but what good will that do your majesty  please to remember that the oracle says the victim must offer himself  well you have offered yourself retorted the king  yes upon one condition  condition again roared the king once more drawing his sword begone  somebody else will be glad enough to take the honour off your shoulders  your majesty knows it will not be easy to get another to take my place  well what is your condition growled the king feeling that the prince was right  only this replied the prince  that as i must on no account die before i am fairly drowned and the waiting will be rather wearisome the princess your daughter shall go with me feed me with her own hands and look at me now and then to comfort me for you must confess it is rather hard  as soon as the water is up to my eyes she may go and be happy and forget her poor shoeblack  here the prince's voice faltered and he very nearly grew sentimental in spite of his resolution  why didn't you tell me before what your condition was  such a fuss about nothing exclaimed the king  do you grant it persisted the prince  of course i do replied the king  very well  i am ready  go and have some dinner then while i set my people to find the place  the king ordered out his guards and gave directions to the officers to find the hole in the lake at once  so the bed of the lake was marked out in divisions and thoroughly examined and in an hour or so the hole was discovered  it was in the middle of a stone near the centre of the lake in the very pool where the golden plate had been found  it was a three-cornered hole of no great size  there was water all round the stone but very little was flowing through the hole    14  this is very kind of you  the prince went to dress for the occasion for he was resolved to die like a prince  when the princess heard that a man had offered to die for her she was so transported that she jumped off the bed feeble as she was and danced about the room for joy  she did not care who the man was that was nothing to her  the hole wanted stopping and if only a man would do why take one  in an hour or two more everything was ready  her maid dressed her in haste and they carried her to the side of the lake  when she saw it she shrieked and covered her face with her hands  they bore her across to the stone where they had already placed a little boat for her  the water was not deep enough to float it but they hoped it would be before long  they laid her on cushions placed in the boat wines and fruits and other nice things and stretched a canopy over all  in a few minutes the prince appeared  the princess recognized him at once but did not think it worth while to acknowledge him  here i am said the prince  put me in  they told me it was a shoeblack said the princess  so i am said the prince  i blacked your little boots three times a day because they were all i could get of you  put me in  the courtiers did not resent his bluntness except by saying to each other that he was taking it out in impudence  but how was he to be put in  the golden plate contained no instructions on this point  the prince looked at the hole and saw but one way  he put both his legs into it sitting on the stone and stooping forward covered the corner that remained open with his two hands  in this uncomfortable position he resolved to abide his fate and turning to the people said   now you can go  the king had already gone home to dinner  now you can go repeated the princess after him like a parrot  the people obeyed her and went  presently a little wave flowed over the stone and wetted one of the prince's knees  but he did not mind it much  he began to sing and the song he sang was this      as a world that has no well   darting bright in forest dell   as a world without the gleam   of the downward-going stream   as a world without the glance   of the ocean's fair expanse   as a world where never rain   glittered on the sunny plain    such my heart thy world would be   if no love did flow in thee    as a world without the sound   of the rivulets underground   or the bubbling of the spring   out of darkness wandering   or the mighty rush and flowing   of the river's downward going   or the music-showers that drop   on the outspread beech's top   or the ocean's mighty voice   when his lifted waves rejoice    such my soul thy world would be   if no love did sing in thee    lady keep thy world's delight   keep the waters in thy sight   love hath made me strong to go   for thy sake to realms below   where the water's shine and hum   through the darkness never come   let i pray one thought of me   spring a little well in thee   lest thy loveless soul be found   like a dry and thirsty ground   sing again prince  it makes it less tedious said the princess  but the prince was too much overcome to sing any more and a long pause followed  this is very kind of you prince said the princess at last quite coolly as she lay in the boat with her eyes shut  i am sorry i can't return the compliment thought the prince but you are worth dying for after all  again a wavelet and another and another flowed over the stone and wetted both the prince's knees but he did not speak or move two three four hours passed in this way the princess apparently asleep and the prince very patient  but he was much disappointed in his position for he had none of the consolation he had hoped for  at last he could bear it no longer  princess said he  but at the moment up started the princess crying   i'm afloat  i'm afloat  and the little boat bumped against the stone  princess repeated the prince encouraged by seeing her wide awake and looking eagerly at the water  well said she without looking round  your papa promised that you should look at me and you haven't looked at me once  did he  then i suppose i must  but i am so sleepy  sleep then darling and don't mind me said the poor prince  really you are very good replied the princess  i think i will go to sleep again  just give me a glass of wine and a biscuit first said the prince very humbly  with all my heart said the princess and gaped as she said it  she got the wine and the biscuit however and leaning over the side of the boat towards him was compelled to look at him  why prince she said you don't look well  are you sure you don't mind it not a bit answered he feeling very faint indeed  only i shall die before it is of any use to you unless i have something to eat  there then said she holding out the wine to him  ah you must feed me  i dare not move my hands  the water would run away directly  good gracious said the princess and she began at once to feed him with bits of biscuit and sips of wine  as she fed him he contrived to kiss the tips of her fingers now and then  she did not seem to mind it one way or the other  but the prince felt better  now for your own sake princess said he i cannot let you go to sleep  you must sit and look at me else i shall not be able to keep up  well i will do anything i can to oblige you answered she with condescension and sitting down she did look at him and kept looking at him with wonderful steadiness considering all things  the sun went down and the moon rose and gush after gush the waters were rising up the prince's body  they were up to his waist now  why can't we go and have a swim said the princess  there seems to be water enough just about here  i shall never swim more said the prince  oh i forgot said the princess and was silent  so the water grew and grew and rose up and up on the prince  and the princess sat and looked at him  she fed him now and then  the night wore on  the waters rose and rose  the moon rose likewise higher and higher and shone full on the face of the dying prince  the water was up to his neck  will you kiss me princess said he feebly  the nonchalance was all gone now  yes i will answered the princess and kissed him with a long sweet cold kiss  now said he with a sigh of content i die happy  he did not speak again  the princess gave him some wine for the last time  he was past eating  then she sat down again and looked at him the water rose and rose  it touched his chin  it touched his lower lip  it touched between his lips  he shut them hard to keep it out the princess began to feel strange  it touched his upper lip  he breathed through his nostrils  the princess looked wild  it covered his nostrils  her eyes looked scared and shone strange in the moonlight  his head fell back the water closed over it and the bubbles of his last breath bubbled up through the water  the princess gave a shriek and sprang into the lake  she laid hold first of one leg and then of the other and pulled and tugged but she could not move either  she stopped to take breath and that made her think that he could not get any breath  she was frantic she got hold of him and held his head above the water which was possible now his hands were no longer on the hole  but it was of no use for he was past breathing  love and water brought back all her strength  she got under the water and pulled and pulled with her whole might till at last she got one leg out  the other easily followed  how she got him into the boat she never could tell but when she did she fainted away  coming to herself she seized the oars kept herself steady as best she could and rowed and rowed though she had never rowed before  round rocks and over shallows and through mud she rowed till she got to the landing-stairs of the palace  by this time her people were on the shore for they had heard her shriek  she made them carry the prince to her own room and lay him in her bed and light a fire and send for the doctors  but the lake your highness said the chamberlain who roused by the noise came in in his nightcap  go and drown yourself in it she said  this was the last rudeness of which the princess was ever guilty and one must allow that she had good cause to feel provoked with the lord chamberlain  had it been the king himself he would have fared no better  but both he and the queen were fast asleep  and the chamberlain went back to his bed  somehow the doctors never came  so the princess and her old nurse were left with the prince  but the old nurse was a wise woman and knew what to do  they tried everything for a long time without success  the princess was nearly distracted between hope and fear but she tried on and on one thing after another and everything over and over again  at last when they had all but given it up just as the sun rose the prince opened his eyes    15  look at the rain  the princess burst into a passion of tears and fell on the floor there she lay for an hour and her tears never ceased  all the pent-up crying of her life was spent now  and a rain came on such as had never been seen in that country  the sun shone all the time and the great drops which fell straight to the earth shone likewise  the palace was in the heart of a rainbow  it was a rain of rubies and sapphires and emeralds and topazes  the torrents poured from the mountains like molten gold and if it had not been for its subterraneous outlet the lake would have overflowed and inundated the country  it was full from shore to shore  but the princess did not heed the lake  she lay on the floor and wept and this rain within doors was far more wonderful than the rain out of doors  for when it abated a little and she proceeded to rise she found to her astonishment that she could not  at length after many efforts she succeeded in getting upon her feet  but she tumbled down again directly  hearing her fall her old nurse uttered a yell of delight and ran to her screaming   my darling child she's found her gravity  oh that's it is it said the princess rubbing her shoulder and her knee alternately  i consider it very unpleasant  i feel as if i should be crushed to pieces  hurrah cried the prince from the bed  if you've come round princess so have i  how's the lake  brimful answered the nurse  then we're all happy  that we are indeed answered the princess sobbing  and there was rejoicing all over the country that rainy day  even the babies forgot their past troubles and danced and crowed amazingly and the king told stories and the queen listened to them  and he divided the money in his box and she the honey in her pot among all the children  and there was such jubilation as was never heard of before  of course the prince and princess were betrothed at once  but the princess had to learn to walk before they could be married with any propriety  and this was not so easy at her time of life for she could walk no more than a baby  she was always falling down and hurting herself  is this the gravity you used to make so much of said she one day to the prince as he raised her from the floor  for my part i was a great deal more comfortable without it  no no that's not it  this is it replied the prince as he took her up and carried her about like a baby kissing her all the time this is gravity  that's better said she  i don't mind that so much  and she smiled the sweetest loveliest smile in the prince's face  and she gave him one little kiss in return for all his and he thought them overpaid for he was beside himself with delight  i fear she complained of her gravity more than once after this notwithstanding  it was a long time before she got reconciled to walking  but the pain of learning it was quite counterbalanced by two things either of which would have been sufficient consolation  the first was that the prince himself was her teacher and the second that she could tumble into the lake as often as she pleased  still she preferred to have the prince jump in with her and the splash they made before was nothing to the splash they made now  the lake never sank again  in process of time it wore the roof of the cavern quite through and was twice as deep as before  the only revenge the princess took upon her aunt was to tread pretty hard on her gouty toe the next time she saw her  but she was sorry for it the very next day when she heard that the water had undermined her house and that it had fallen in the night burying her in its ruins whence no one ever ventured to dig up her body  there she lies to this day  so the prince and princess lived and were happy and had crowns of gold and clothes of cloth and shoes of leather and children of boys and girls not one of whom was ever known on the most critical occasion to lose the smallest atom of his or her due proportion of gravity,The Light Princess and the Goblin,George MacDonald

whose father was king over a great country full of mountains and valleys  his palace was built upon one of the mountains and was very grand and beautiful  the princess whose name was irene was born there but she was sent soon after her birth because her mother was not very strong to be brought up by country people in a large house half castle half farmhouse on the side of another mountain about half-way between its base and its peak  the princess was a sweet little creature and at the time my story begins was about eight years old i think but she got older very fast her face was fair and pretty with eyes like two bits of night sky each with a star dissolved in the blue  those eyes you would have thought must have known they came from there so often were they turned up in that direction  the ceiling of her nursery was blue with stars in it as like the sky as they could make it but i doubt if ever she saw the real sky with the stars in it for a reason which i had better mention at once  these mountains were full of hollow places underneath huge caverns and winding ways some with water running through them and some shining with all colours of the rainbow when a light was taken in there would not have been much known about them had there not been mines there great deep pits with long galleries and passages running off from them which had been dug to get at the ore of which the mountains were full  in the course of digging the miners came upon many of these natural caverns  a few of them had far-off openings out on the side of a mountain or into a ravine  now in these subterranean caverns lived a strange race of beings called by some gnomes by some kobolds by some goblins  there was a legend current in the country that at one time they lived above ground and were very like other people  but for some reason or other concerning which there were different legendary theories the king had laid what they thought too severe taxes upon them or had required observances of them they did not like or had begun to treat them with more severity in some way or other and impose stricter laws and the consequence was that they had all disappeared from the face of the country  according to the legend however instead of going to some other country they had all taken refuge in the subterranean caverns whence they never came out but at night and then seldom showed themselves in any numbers and never to many people at once  it was only in the least frequented and most difficult parts of the mountains that they were said to gather even at night in the open air  those who had caught sight of any of them said that they had greatly altered in the course of generations and no wonder seeing they lived away from the sun in cold and wet and dark places  they were now not ordinarily ugly but either absolutely hideous or ludicrously grotesque both in face and form  there was no invention they said of the most lawless imagination expressed by pen or pencil that could surpass the extravagance of their appearance  but i suspect those who said so had mistaken some of their animal companions for the goblins themselves of which more by and by  the goblins themselves were not so far removed from the human as such a description would imply  and as they grew misshapen in body they had grown in knowledge and cleverness and now were able to do things no mortal could see the possibility of  but as they grew in cunning they grew in mischief and their great delight was in every way they could think of to annoy the people who lived in the open-air storey above them  they had enough of affection left for each other to preserve them from being absolutely cruel for cruelty's sake to those that came in their way but still they so heartily cherished the ancestral grudge against those who occupied their former possessions and especially against the descendants of the king who had caused their expulsion that they sought every opportunity of tormenting them in ways that were as odd as their inventors and although dwarfed and misshapen they had strength equal to their cunning  in the process of time they had got a king and a government of their own whose chief business beyond their own simple affairs was to devise trouble for their neighbours  it will now be pretty evident why the little princess had never seen the sky at night  they were much too afraid of the goblins to let her out of the house then even in company with ever so many attendants and they had good reason as we shall see by and by    chapter 2  the princess loses herself  i have said the princess irene was about eight years old when my story begins  and this is how it begins  one very wet day when the mountain was covered with mist which was constantly gathering itself together into raindrops and pouring down on the roofs of the great old house whence it fell in a fringe of water from the eaves all round about it the princess could not of course go out  she got very tired so tired that even her toys could no longer amuse her  you would wonder at that if i had time to describe to you one half of the toys she had  but then you wouldn't have the toys themselves and that makes all the difference  you can't get tired of a thing before you have it  it was a picture though worth seeing the princess sitting in the nursery with the sky ceiling over her head at a great table covered with her toys  if the artist would like to draw this i should advise him not to meddle with the toys  i am afraid of attempting to describe them and i think he had better not try to draw them  he had better not  he can do a thousand things i can't but i don't think he could draw those toys  no man could better make the princess herself than he could though leaning with her back bowed into the back of the chair her head hanging down and her hands in her lap very miserable as she would say herself not even knowing what she would like except it were to go out and get thoroughly wet and catch a particularly nice cold and have to go to bed and take gruel  the next moment after you see her sitting there her nurse goes out of the room  even that is a change and the princess wakes up a little and looks about her  then she tumbles off her chair and runs out of the door not the same door the nurse went out of but one which opened at the foot of a curious old stair of worm-eaten oak which looked as if never anyone had set foot upon it  she had once before been up six steps and that was sufficient reason in such a day for trying to find out what was at the top of it  up and up she ran such a long way it seemed to her until she came to the top of the third flight  there she found the landing was the end of a long passage  into this she ran  it was full of doors on each side  there were so many that she did not care to open any but ran on to the end where she turned into another passage also full of doors when she had turned twice more and still saw doors and only doors about her she began to get frightened  it was so silent  and all those doors must hide rooms with nobody in them  that was dreadful also the rain made a great trampling noise on the roof  she turned and started at full speed her little footsteps echoing through the sounds of the rain back for the stairs and her safe nursery  so she thought but she had lost herself long ago  it doesn't follow that she was lost because she had lost herself though  she ran for some distance turned several times and then began to be afraid  very soon she was sure that she had lost the way back rooms everywhere and no stair  her little heart beat as fast as her little feet ran and a lump of tears was growing in her throat but she was too eager and perhaps too frightened to cry for some time  at last her hope failed her  nothing but passages and doors everywhere  she threw herself on the floor and burst into a wailing cry broken by sobs  she did not cry long however for she was as brave as could be expected of a princess of her age  after a good cry she got up and brushed the dust from her frock  oh what old dust it was then she wiped her eyes with her hands for princesses don't always have their handkerchiefs in their pockets any more than some other little girls i know of  next like a true princess she resolved on going wisely to work to find her way back  she would walk through the passages and look in every direction for the stair this she did but without success  she went over the same ground again an again without knowing it for the passages and doors were all alike  at last in a corner through a half-open door she did see a stair  but alas it went the wrong way  instead of going down it went up  frightened as she was however she could not help wishing to see where yet further the stair could lead  it was very narrow and so steep that she went on like a four-legged creature on her hands and feet    chapter 3  the princess and we shall see who  when she came to the top she found herself in a little square place with three doors two opposite each other and one opposite the top of the stair  she stood for a moment without an idea in her little head what to do next  but as she stood she began to hear a curious humming sound  could it be the rain  no  it was much more gentle and even monotonous than the sound of the rain which now she scarcely heard the low sweet humming sound went on sometimes stopping for a little while and then beginning again  it was more like the hum of a very happy bee that had found a rich well of honey in some globular flower than anything else i can think of at this moment  where could it come from  she laid her ear first to one of the doors to hearken if it was there then to another  when she laid her ear against the third door there could be no doubt where it came from  it must be from something in that room  what could it be  she was rather afraid but her curiosity was stronger than her fear and she opened the door very gently and peeped in  what do you think she saw  a very old lady who sat spinning  perhaps you will wonder how the princess could tell that the old lady was an old lady when i inform you that not only was she beautiful but her skin was smooth and white  i will tell you more  her hair was combed back from her forehead and face and hung loose far down and all over her back  that is not much like an old lady is it  ah but it was white almost as snow  and although her face was so smooth her eyes looked so wise that you could not have helped seeing she must be old  the princess though she could not have told you why did think her very old indeed quite fifty she said to herself  but she was rather older than that as you shall hear  while the princess stared bewildered with her head just inside the door the old lady lifted hers and said in a sweet but old and rather shaky voice which mingled very pleasantly with the continued hum of her wheel   'come in my dear come in  i am glad to see you'  that the princess was a real princess you might see now quite plainly for she didn't hang on to the handle of the door and stare without moving as i have known some do who ought to have been princesses but were only rather vulgar little girls  she did as she was told stepped inside the door at once and shut it gently behind her  'come to me my dear' said the old lady  and again the princess did as she was told  she approached the old lady rather slowly i confess but did not stop until she stood by her side and looked up in her face with her blue eyes and the two melted stars in them  'why what have you been doing with your eyes child' asked the old lady  'crying' answered the princess  'why child'  'because i couldn't find my way down again'  'but you could find your way up'  'not at first not for a long time'  'but your face is streaked like the back of a zebra  hadn't you a handkerchief to wipe your eyes with'  'no'  'then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you'  'please i didn't know you were here  i will next time'  'there's a good child' said the old lady  then she stopped her wheel and rose and going out of the room returned with a little silver basin and a soft white towel with which she washed and wiped the bright little face  and the princess thought her hands were so smooth and nice  when she carried away the basin and towel the little princess wondered to see how straight and tall she was for although she was so old she didn't stoop a bit  she was dressed in black velvet with thick white heavy-looking lace about it and on the black dress her hair shone like silver  there was hardly any more furniture in the room than there might have been in that of the poorest old woman who made her bread by her spinning  there was no carpet on the floor no table anywhere nothing but the spinning-wheel and the chair beside it  when she came back she sat down and without a word began her spinning once more while irene who had never seen a spinning-wheel stood by her side and looked on  when the old lady had got her thread fairly going again she said to the princess but without looking at her   'do you know my name child'  'no i don't know it' answered the princess  'my name is irene'  'that's my name' cried the princess  'i know that  i let you have mine  i haven't got your name you've got mine'  'how can that be' asked the princess bewildered  'i've always had my name'  'your papa the king asked me if i had any objection to your having it and of course i hadn't  i let you have it with pleasure'  'it was very kind of you to give me your name and such a pretty one' said the princess  'oh not so very kind' said the old lady  'a name is one of those things one can give away and keep all the same  i have a good many such things  wouldn't you like to know who i am child'  'yes that i should very much'  'i'm your great-great-grandmother' said the lady  'what's that' asked the princess  'i'm your father's mother's father's mother'  'oh dear i can't understand that' said the princess  'i dare say not  i didn't expect you would  but that's no reason why i shouldn't say it'  'oh no' answered the princess  'i will explain it all to you when you are older' the lady went on 'but you will be able to understand this much now  i came here to take care of you'  'is it long since you came  was it yesterday  or was it today because it was so wet that i couldn't get out'  'i've been here ever since you came yourself'  'what a long time' said the princess  'i don't remember it at all'  'no  i suppose not'  'but i never saw you before'  'no  but you shall see me again'  'do you live in this room always'  'i don't sleep in it  i sleep on the opposite side of the landing i sit here most of the day'  'i shouldn't like it  my nursery is much prettier  you must be a queen too if you are my great big grand-mother'  'yes i am a queen'  'where is your crown then' 'in my bedroom'  'i should like to see it'  'you shall some day not today'  'i wonder why nursie never told me'  'nursie doesn't know  she never saw me'  'but somebody knows that you are in the house'  'no nobody'  'how do you get your dinner then'  'i keep poultry of a sort'  'where do you keep them'  'i will show you'  'and who makes the chicken broth for you'  'i never kill any of my chickens'  'then i can't understand'  'what did you have for breakfast this morning' asked the lady  'oh i had bread and milk and an egg i dare say you eat their eggs'  'yes that's it  i eat their eggs'  'is that what makes your hair so white'  'no my dear  it's old age  i am very old'  'i thought so  are you fifty'  'yes more than that'  'are you a hundred'  'yes more than that  i am too old for you to guess  come and see my chickens'  again she stopped her spinning  she rose took the princess by the hand led her out of the room and opened the door opposite the stair the princess expected to see a lot of hens and chickens but instead of that she saw the blue sky first and then the roofs of the house with a multitude of the loveliest pigeons mostly white but of all colours walking about making bows to each other and talking a language she could not understand  she clapped her hands with delight and up rose such a flapping of wings that she in her turn was startled  'you've frightened my poultry' said the old lady smiling  'and they've frightened me' said the princess smiling too  'but what very nice poultry  are the eggs nice'  'yes very nice' 'what a small egg-spoon you must have  wouldn't it be better to keep hens and get bigger eggs'  'how should i feed them though'  'i see' said the princess  'the pigeons feed themselves  they've got wings'  'just so  if they couldn't fly i couldn't eat their eggs'  'but how do you get at the eggs  where are their nests'  the lady took hold of a little loop of string in the wall at the side of the door and lifting a shutter showed a great many pigeon-holes with nests some with young ones and some with eggs in them  the birds came in at the other side and she took out the eggs on this side  she closed it again quickly lest the young ones should be frightened  'oh what a nice way' cried the princess  'will you give me an egg to eat  i'm rather hungry'  'i will some day but now you must go back or nursie will be miserable about you  i dare say she's looking for you everywhere'  'except here' answered the princess  'oh how surprised she will be when i tell her about my great big grand-grand-mother'  'yes that she will' said the old lady with a curious smile 'mind you tell her all about it exactly'  'that i will  please will you take me back to her'  'i can't go all the way but i will take you to the top of the stair and then you must run down quite fast into your own room'  the little princess put her hand in the old lady's who looking this way and that brought her to the top of the first stair and thence to the bottom of the second and did not leave her till she saw her half-way down the third  when she heard the cry of her nurse's pleasure at finding her she turned and walked up the stairs again very fast indeed for such a very great grandmother and sat down to her spinning with another strange smile on her sweet old face  about this spinning of hers i will tell you more another time  guess what she was spinning    chapter 4  what the nurse thought of it  'why where can you have been princess' asked the nurse taking her in her arms  'it's very unkind of you to hide away so long i began to be afraid '  here she checked herself  'what were you afraid of nursie' asked the princess  'never mind' she answered  'perhaps i will tell you another day now tell me where you have been'  'i've been up a long way to see my very great huge old grandmother' said the princess  'what do you mean by that' asked the nurse who thought she was making fun  'i mean that i've been a long way up and up to see my great grandmother  ah nursie you don't know what a beautiful mother of grandmothers i've got upstairs  she is such an old lady with such lovely white hair as white as my silver cup  now when i think of it i think her hair must be silver'  'what nonsense you are talking princess' said the nurse  'i'm not talking nonsense' returned irene rather offended  'i will tell you all about her  she's much taller than you and much prettier'  'oh i dare say' remarked the nurse  'and she lives upon pigeons' eggs'  'most likely' said the nurse  'and she sits in an empty room spin-spinning all day long'  'not a doubt of it' said the nurse  'and she keeps her crown in her bedroom'  'of course quite the proper place to keep her crown in  she wears it in bed i'll be bound'  'she didn't say that  and i don't think she does  that wouldn't be comfortable would it  i don't think my papa wears his crown for a night-cap  does he nursie'  'i never asked him  i dare say he does'  'and she's been there ever since i came here ever so many years'  'anybody could have told you that' said the nurse who did not believe a word irene was saying  'why didn't you tell me then'  'there was no necessity  you could make it all up for yourself'  'you don't believe me then' exclaimed the princess astonished and angry as she well might be  'did you expect me to believe you princess' asked the nurse coldly 'i know princesses are in the habit of telling make-believes but you are the first i ever heard of who expected to have them believed' she added seeing that the child was strangely in earnest  the princess burst into tears  'well i must say' remarked the nurse now thoroughly vexed with her for crying 'it is not at all becoming in a princess to tell stories and expect to be believed just because she is a princess'  'but it's quite true i tell you'  'you've dreamt it then child'  'no i didn't dream it  i went upstairs and i lost myself and if i hadn't found the beautiful lady i should never have found myself'  'oh i dare say'  'well you just come up with me and see if i'm not telling the truth'  'indeed i have other work to do  it's your dinnertime and i won't have any more such nonsense'  the princess wiped her eyes and her face grew so hot that they were soon quite dry  she sat down to her dinner but ate next to nothing not to be believed does not at all agree with princesses  for a real princess cannot tell a lie  so all the afternoon she did not speak a word  only when the nurse spoke to her she answered her for a real princess is never rude even when she does well to be offended  of course the nurse was not comfortable in her mind not that she suspected the least truth in irene's story but that she loved her dearly and was vexed with herself for having been cross to her she thought her crossness was the cause of the princess's unhappiness and had no idea that she was really and deeply hurt at not being believed but as it became more and more plain during the evening in her every motion and look that although she tried to amuse herself with her toys her heart was too vexed and troubled to enjoy them her nurse's discomfort grew and grew  when bedtime came she undressed and laid her down but the child instead of holding up her little mouth to be kissed turned away from her and lay still  then nursie's heart gave way altogether and she began to cry  at the sound of her first sob the princess turned again and held her face to kiss her as usual  but the nurse had her handkerchief to her eyes and did not see the movement  'nursie' said the princess 'why won't you believe me'  'because i can't believe you' said the nurse getting angry again  'ah then you can't help it' said irene 'and i will not be vexed with you any more  i will give you a kiss and go to sleep'  'you little angel' cried the nurse and caught her out of bed and walked about the room with her in her arms kissing and hugging her  'you will let me take you to see my dear old great big grandmother won't you' said the princess as she laid her down again  'and you won't say i'm ugly any more will you princess' 'nursie i never said you were ugly  what can you mean'  'well if you didn't say it you meant it'  'indeed i never did'  'you said i wasn't so pretty as that '  'as my beautiful grandmother yes i did say that and i say it again for it's quite true'  'then i do think you are unkind' said the nurse and put her handkerchief to her eyes again  'nursie dear everybody can't be as beautiful as every other body you know  you are very nice-looking but if you had been as beautiful as my grandmother '  'bother your grandmother' said the nurse  'nurse that's very rude  you are not fit to be spoken to till you can behave better'  the princess turned away once more and again the nurse was ashamed of herself  'i'm sure i beg your pardon princess' she said though still in an offended tone  but the princess let the tone pass and heeded only the words  'you won't say it again i am sure' she answered once more turning towards her nurse  'i was only going to say that if you had been twice as nice-looking as you are some king or other would have married you and then what would have become of me'  'you are an angel' repeated the nurse again embracing her 'now' insisted irene 'you will come and see my grandmother won't you'  'i will go with you anywhere you like my cherub' she answered and in two minutes the weary little princess was fast asleep    chapter 5  the princess lets well alone  when she woke the next morning the first thing she heard was the rain still falling  indeed this day was so like the last that it would have been difficult to tell where was the use of it  the first thing she thought of however was not the rain but the lady in the tower and the first question that occupied her thoughts was whether she should not ask the nurse to fulfil her promise this very morning and go with her to find her grandmother as soon as she had had her breakfast  but she came to the conclusion that perhaps the lady would not be pleased if she took anyone to see her without first asking leave especially as it was pretty evident seeing she lived on pigeons' eggs and cooked them herself that she did not want the household to know she was there  so the princess resolved to take the first opportunity of running up alone and asking whether she might bring her nurse  she believed the fact that she could not otherwise convince her she was telling the truth would have much weight with her grandmother  the princess and her nurse were the best of friends all dressing-time and the princess in consequence ate an enormous little breakfast  'i wonder lootie' that was her pet name for her nurse 'what pigeons' eggs taste like' she said as she was eating her egg not quite a common one for they always picked out the pinky ones for her  'we'll get you a pigeon's egg and you shall judge for yourself' said the nurse  'oh no no' returned irene suddenly reflecting they might disturb the old lady in getting it and that even if they did not she would have one less in consequence  'what a strange creature you are' said the nurse 'first to want a thing and then to refuse it'  but she did not say it crossly and the princess never minded any remarks that were not unfriendly  'well you see lootie there are reasons' she returned and said no more for she did not want to bring up the subject of their former strife lest her nurse should offer to go before she had had her grandmother's permission to bring her  of course she could refuse to take her but then she would believe her less than ever  now the nurse as she said herself afterwards could not be every moment in the room and as never before yesterday had the princess given her the smallest reason for anxiety it had not yet come into her head to watch her more closely  so she soon gave her a chance and the very first that offered irene was off and up the stairs again  this day's adventure however did not turn out like yesterday's although it began like it and indeed to-day is very seldom like yesterday if people would note the differences even when it rains the princess ran through passage after passage and could not find the stair of the tower  my own suspicion is that she had not gone up high enough and was searching on the second instead of the third floor when she turned to go back she failed equally in her search after the stair  she was lost once more  something made it even worse to bear this time and it was no wonder that she cried again  suddenly it occurred to her that it was after having cried before that she had found her grandmother's stair  she got up at once wiped her eyes and started upon a fresh quest  this time although she did not find what she hoped she found what was next best  she did not come on a stair that went up but she came upon one that went down  it was evidently not the stair she had come up yet it was a good deal better than none so down she went and was singing merrily before she reached the bottom there to her surprise she found herself in the kitchen  although she was not allowed to go there alone her nurse had often taken her and she was a great favourite with the servants  so there was a general rush at her the moment she appeared for every one wanted to have her and the report of where she was soon reached the nurse's ears  she came at once to fetch her but she never suspected how she had got there and the princess kept her own counsel  her failure to find the old lady not only disappointed her but made her very thoughtful  sometimes she came almost to the nurse's opinion that she had dreamed all about her but that fancy never lasted very long  she wondered much whether she should ever see her again and thought it very sad not to have been able to find her when she particularly wanted her  she resolved to say nothing more to her nurse on the subject seeing it was so little in her power to prove her words    chapter 6  the little miner  the next day the great cloud still hung over the mountain and the rain poured like water from a full sponge  the princess was very fond of being out of doors and she nearly cried when she saw that the weather was no better  but the mist was not of such a dark dingy grey there was light in it and as the hours went on it grew brighter and brighter until it was almost too brilliant to look at and late in the afternoon the sun broke out so gloriously that irene clapped her hands crying   'see see lootie  the sun has had his face washed  look how bright he is  do get my hat and let us go out for a walk  oh dear oh dear how happy i am'  lootie was very glad to please the princess  she got her hat and cloak and they set out together for a walk up the mountain for the road was so hard and steep that the water could not rest upon it and it was always dry enough for walking a few minutes after the rain ceased  the clouds were rolling away in broken pieces like great overwoolly sheep whose wool the sun had bleached till it was almost too white for the eyes to bear  between them the sky shone with a deeper and purer blue because of the rain  the trees on the roadside were hung all over with drops which sparkled in the sun like jewels the only things that were no brighter for the rain were the brooks that ran down the mountain they had changed from the clearness of crystal to a muddy brown but what they lost in colour they gained in sound or at least in noise for a brook when it is swollen is not so musical as before  but irene was in raptures with the great brown streams tumbling down everywhere and lootie shared in her delight for she too had been confined to the house for three days  at length she observed that the sun was getting low and said it was time to be going back  she made the remark again and again but every time the princess begged her to go on just a little farther and a little farther reminding her that it was much easier to go downhill and saying that when they did turn they would be at home in a moment so on and on they did go now to look at a group of ferns over whose tops a stream was pouring in a watery arch now to pick a shining stone from a rock by the wayside now to watch the flight of some bird suddenly the shadow of a great mountain peak came up from behind and shot in front of them  when the nurse saw it she started and shook and catching hold of the princess's hand turned and began to run down the hill  'what's all the haste nursie' asked irene running alongside of her  'we must not be out a moment longer'  'but we can't help being out a good many moments longer'  it was too true  the nurse almost cried  they were much too far from home  it was against express orders to be out with the princess one moment after the sun was down and they were nearly a mile up the mountain  if his majesty irene's papa were to hear of it lootie would certainly be dismissed and to leave the princess would break her heart  it was no wonder she ran  but irene was not in the least frightened not knowing anything to be frightened at  she kept on chattering as well as she could but it was not easy  'lootie lootie why do you run so fast  it shakes my teeth when i talk'  'then don't talk' said lootie  'but the princess went on talking  she was always saying  'look look lootie' but lootie paid no more heed to anything she said only ran on  'look look lootie  don't you see that funny man peeping over the rock'  lootie only ran the faster  they had to pass the rock and when they came nearer the princess saw it was only a lump of the rock itself that she had taken for a man  'look look lootie  there's such a curious creature at the foot of that old tree  look at it lootie  it's making faces at us i do think'  lootie gave a stifled cry and ran faster still so fast that irene's little legs could not keep up with her and she fell with a crash  it was a hard downhill road and she had been running very fast so it was no wonder she began to cry  this put the nurse nearly beside herself but all she could do was to run on the moment she got the princess on her feet again  'who's that laughing at me' said the princess trying to keep in her sobs and running too fast for her grazed knees  'nobody child' said the nurse almost angrily  but that instant there came a burst of coarse tittering from somewhere near and a hoarse indistinct voice that seemed to say  'lies lies lies'  'oh' cried the nurse with a sigh that was almost a scream and ran on faster than ever  'nursie lootie i can't run any more  do let us walk a bit'  'what am i to do' said the nurse  'here i will carry you'  she caught her up but found her much too heavy to run with and had to set her down again  then she looked wildly about her gave a great cry and said   'we've taken the wrong turning somewhere and i don't know where we are  we are lost lost'  the terror she was in had quite bewildered her  it was true enough they had lost the way  they had been running down into a little valley in which there was no house to be seen  now irene did not know what good reason there was for her nurse's terror for the servants had all strict orders never to mention the goblins to her but it was very discomposing to see her nurse in such a fright  before however she had time to grow thoroughly alarmed like her she heard the sound of whistling and that revived her  presently she saw a boy coming up the road from the valley to meet them  he was the whistler but before they met his whistling changed to singing and this is something like what he sang     'ring dod bang   go the hammers' clang   hit and turn and bore   whizz and puff and roar   thus we rive the rocks   force the goblin locks    see the shining ore   one two three    bright as gold can be   four five six    shovels mattocks picks   seven eight nine    light your lamp at mine   ten eleven twelve    loosely hold the helve   we're the merry miner-boys   make the goblins hold their noise'   'i wish you would hold your noise' said the nurse rudely for the very word goblin at such a time and in such a place made her tremble  it would bring the goblins upon them to a certainty she thought to defy them in that way  but whether the boy heard her or not he did not stop his singing     'thirteen fourteen fifteen    this is worth the siftin'   sixteen seventeen eighteen    there's the match and lay't in   nineteen twenty    goblins in a plenty'   'do be quiet' cried the nurse in a whispered shriek  but the boy who was now close at hand still went on    'hush scush scurry   there you go in a hurry   gobble gobble goblin   there you go a wobblin'   hobble hobble hobblin'    cobble cobble cobblin'   hob-bob-goblin    huuuuuh'   'there' said the boy as he stood still opposite them  'there that'll do for them  they can't bear singing and they can't stand that song  they can't sing themselves for they have no more voice than a crow and they don't like other people to sing'  the boy was dressed in a miner's dress with a curious cap on his head he was a very nice-looking boy with eyes as dark as the mines in which he worked and as sparkling as the crystals in their rocks  he was about twelve years old  his face was almost too pale for beauty which came of his being so little in the open air and the sunlight for even vegetables grown in the dark are white but he looked happy merry indeed perhaps at the thought of having routed the goblins and his bearing as he stood before them had nothing clownish or rude about it  'i saw them' he went on 'as i came up and i'm very glad i did i knew they were after somebody but i couldn't see who it was they won't touch you so long as i'm with you'  'why who are you' asked the nurse offended at the freedom with which he spoke to them  'i'm peter's son'  'who's peter'  'peter the miner'  'i don't know him' 'i'm his son though'  'and why should the goblins mind you pray'  'because i don't mind them  i'm used to them'  'what difference does that make'  'if you're not afraid of them they're afraid of you  i'm not afraid of them  that's all  but it's all that's wanted up here that is it's a different thing down there  they won't always mind that song even down there  and if anyone sings it they stand grinning at him awfully and if he gets frightened and misses a word or says a wrong one they oh don't they give it him'  'what do they do to him' asked irene with a trembling voice  'don't go frightening the princess' said the nurse  'the princess' repeated the little miner taking off his curious cap 'i beg your pardon but you oughtn't to be out so late everybody knows that's against the law'  'yes indeed it is' said the nurse beginning to cry again  'and i shall have to suffer for it'  'what does that matter' said the boy  'it must be your fault  it is the princess who will suffer for it  i hope they didn't hear you call her the princess  if they did they're sure to know her again  they're awfully sharp'  'lootie lootie' cried the princess  'take me home'  'don't go on like that' said the nurse to the boy almost fiercely 'how could i help it  i lost my way'  'you shouldn't have been out so late  you wouldn't have lost your way if you hadn't been frightened' said the boy  'come along i'll soon set you right again  shall i carry your little highness'  'impertinence' murmured the nurse but she did not say it aloud for she thought if she made him angry he might take his revenge by telling someone belonging to the house and then it would be sure to come to the king's ears  'no thank you' said irene  'i can walk very well though i can't run so fast as nursie  if you will give me one hand lootie will give me another and then i shall get on famously'  they soon had her between them holding a hand of each  'now let's run' said the nurse  'no no' said the little miner  'that's the worst thing you can do if you hadn't run before you would not have lost your way and if you run now they will be after you in a moment'  'i don't want to run' said irene  'you don't think of me' said the nurse  'yes i do lootie  the boy says they won't touch us if we don't run'  'yes but if they know at the house that i've kept you out so late i shall be turned away and that would break my heart'  'turned away lootie  who would turn you away'  'your papa child'  'but i'll tell him it was all my fault  and you know it was lootie'  'he won't mind that  i'm sure he won't'  'then i'll cry and go down on my knees to him and beg him not to take away my own dear lootie'  the nurse was comforted at hearing this and said no more  they went on walking pretty fast but taking care not to run a step  'i want to talk to you' said irene to the little miner 'but it's so awkward  i don't know your name'  'my name's curdie little princess'  'what a funny name curdie  what more'  'curdie peterson  what's your name please'  'irene'  'what more'  'i don't know what more  what more is my name lootie'  'princesses haven't got more than one name  they don't want it'  'oh then curdie you must call me just irene and no more'  'no indeed' said the nurse indignantly  'he shall do no such thing'  'what shall he call me then lootie'  'your royal highness' 'my royal highness  what's that  no no lootie  i won't be called names  i don't like them  you told me once yourself it's only rude children that call names and i'm sure curdie wouldn't be rude  curdie my name's irene'  'well irene' said curdie with a glance at the nurse which showed he enjoyed teasing her 'it is very kind of you to let me call you anything  i like your name very much'  he expected the nurse to interfere again but he soon saw that she was too frightened to speak  she was staring at something a few yards before them in the middle of the path where it narrowed between rocks so that only one could pass at a time  'it is very much kinder of you to go out of your way to take us home' said irene  'i'm not going out of my way yet' said curdie  'it's on the other side of those rocks the path turns off to my father's'  'you wouldn't think of leaving us till we're safe home i'm sure' gasped the nurse  'of course not' said curdie  'you dear good kind curdie  i'll give you a kiss when we get home' said the princess  the nurse gave her a great pull by the hand she held  but at that instant the something in the middle of the way which had looked like a great lump of earth brought down by the rain began to move one after another it shot out four long things like two arms and two legs but it was now too dark to tell what they were  the nurse began to tremble from head to foot  irene clasped curdie's hand yet faster and curdie began to sing again     'one two    hit and hew   three four    blast and bore   five six    there's a fix   seven eight    hold it straight   nine ten    hit again   hurry scurry   bother smother   there's a toad   in the road   smash it   squash it   fry it   dry it   you're another   up and off   there's enough    huuuuuh'   as he uttered the last words curdie let go his hold of his companion and rushed at the thing in the road as if he would trample it under his feet  it gave a great spring and ran straight up one of the rocks like a huge spider  curdie turned back laughing and took irene's hand again  she grasped his very tight but said nothing till they had passed the rocks  a few yards more and she found herself on a part of the road she knew and was able to speak again  'do you know curdie i don't quite like your song  it sounds to me rather rude' she said  'well perhaps it is' answered curdie  'i never thought of that it's a way we have  we do it because they don't like it'  'who don't like it'  'the cobs as we call them'  'don't' said the nurse  'why not' said curdie  'i beg you won't  please don't'  'oh if you ask me that way of course i won't though i don't a bit know why  look there are the lights of your great house down below you'll be at home in five minutes now'  nothing more happened  they reached home in safety  nobody had missed them or even known they had gone out and they arrived at the door belonging to their part of the house without anyone seeing them  the nurse was rushing in with a hurried and not over-gracious good night to curdie but the princess pulled her hand from hers and was just throwing her arms round curdie's neck when she caught her again and dragged her away  'lootie lootie i promised a kiss' cried irene  'a princess mustn't give kisses  it's not at all proper' said lootie  'but i promised' said the princess  'there's no occasion he's only a miner-boy'  'he's a good boy and a brave boy and he has been very kind to us lootie lootie i promised'  'then you shouldn't have promised'  'lootie i promised him a kiss'  'your royal highness' said lootie suddenly grown very respectful 'must come in directly'  'nurse a princess must not break her word' said irene drawing herself up and standing stock-still  lootie did not know which the king might count the worst to let the princess be out after sunset or to let her kiss a miner-boy she did not know that being a gentleman as many kings have been he would have counted neither of them the worse  however much he might have disliked his daughter to kiss the miner-boy he would not have had her break her word for all the goblins in creation but as i say the nurse was not lady enough to understand this and so she was in a great difficulty for if she insisted someone might hear the princess cry and run to see and then all would come out  but here curdie came again to the rescue  'never mind princess irene' he said  'you mustn't kiss me tonight but you shan't break your word  i will come another time  you may be sure i will'  'oh thank you curdie' said the princess and stopped crying  'good night irene good night lootie' said curdie and turned and was out of sight in a moment  'i should like to see him' muttered the nurse as she carried the princess to the nursery  'you will see him' said irene  'you may be sure curdie will keep his word  he's sure to come again'  'i should like to see him' repeated the nurse and said no more she did not want to open a new cause of strife with the princess by saying more plainly what she meant  glad enough that she had succeeded both in getting home unseen and in keeping the princess from kissing the miner's boy she resolved to watch her far better in future  her carelessness had already doubled the danger she was in  formerly the goblins were her only fear now she had to protect her charge from curdie as well    chapter 7  the mines  curdie went home whistling  he resolved to say nothing about the princess for fear of getting the nurse into trouble for while he enjoyed teasing her because of her absurdity he was careful not to do her any harm  he saw no more of the goblins and was soon fast asleep in his bed  he woke in the middle of the night and thought he heard curious noises outside  he sat up and listened then got up and opening the door very quietly went out  when he peeped round the corner he saw under his own window a group of stumpy creatures whom he at once recognized by their shape  hardly however had he begun his 'one two three' when they broke asunder scurried away and were out of sight  he returned laughing got into bed again and was fast asleep in a moment  reflecting a little over the matter in the morning he came to the conclusion that as nothing of the kind had ever happened before they must be annoyed with him for interfering to protect the princess  by the time he was dressed however he was thinking of something quite different for he did not value the enmity of the goblins in the least as soon as they had had breakfast he set off with his father for the mine  they entered the hill by a natural opening under a huge rock where a little stream rushed out  they followed its course for a few yards when the passage took a turn and sloped steeply into the heart of the hill  with many angles and windings and branchings-off and sometimes with steps where it came upon a natural gulf it led them deep into the hill before they arrived at the place where they were at present digging out the precious ore this was of various kinds for the mountain was very rich in the better sorts of metals  with flint and steel and tinder-box they lighted their lamps then fixed them on their heads and were soon hard at work with their pickaxes and shovels and hammers  father and son were at work near each other but not in the same gang the passages out of which the ore was dug they called gangs for when the lode or vein of ore was small one miner would have to dig away alone in a passage no bigger than gave him just room to work sometimes in uncomfortable cramped positions  if they stopped for a moment they could hear everywhere around them some nearer some farther off the sounds of their companions burrowing away in all directions in the inside of the great mountain some boring holes in the rock in order to blow it up with gunpowder others shovelling the broken ore into baskets to be carried to the mouth of the mine others hitting away with their pickaxes sometimes if the miner was in a very lonely part he would hear only a tap-tapping no louder than that of a woodpecker for the sound would come from a great distance off through the solid mountain rock  the work was hard at best for it is very warm underground but it was not particularly unpleasant and some of the miners when they wanted to earn a little more money for a particular purpose would stop behind the rest and work all night  but you could not tell night from day down there except from feeling tired and sleepy for no light of the sun ever came into those gloomy regions  some who had thus remained behind during the night although certain there were none of their companions at work would declare the next morning that they heard every time they halted for a moment to take breath a tap-tapping all about them as if the mountain were then more full of miners than ever it was during the day and some in consequence would never stay overnight for all knew those were the sounds of the goblins  they worked only at night for the miners' night was the goblins' day indeed the greater number of the miners were afraid of the goblins for there were strange stories well known amongst them of the treatment some had received whom the goblins had surprised at their work during the night  the more courageous of them however amongst them peter peterson and curdie who in this took after his father had stayed in the mine all night again and again and although they had several times encountered a few stray goblins had never yet failed in driving them away  as i have indicated already the chief defence against them was verse for they hated verse of every kind and some kinds they could not endure at all  i suspect they could not make any themselves and that was why they disliked it so much  at all events those who were most afraid of them were those who could neither make verses themselves nor remember the verses that other people made for them while those who were never afraid were those who could make verses for themselves for although there were certain old rhymes which were very effectual yet it was well known that a new rhyme if of the right sort was even more distasteful to them and therefore more effectual in putting them to flight  perhaps my readers may be wondering what the goblins could be about working all night long seeing they never carried up the ore and sold it but when i have informed them concerning what curdie learned the very next night they will be able to understand  for curdie had determined if his father would permit him to remain there alone this night and that for two reasons  first he wanted to get extra wages that he might buy a very warm red petticoat for his mother who had begun to complain of the cold of the mountain air sooner than usual this autumn and second he had just a faint hope of finding out what the goblins were about under his window the night before  when he told his father he made no objection for he had great confidence in his boy's courage and resources  'i'm sorry i can't stay with you' said peter 'but i want to go and pay the parson a visit this evening and besides i've had a bit of a headache all day'  'i'm sorry for that father' said curdie  'oh it's not much  you'll be sure to take care of yourself won't you'  'yes father i will  i'll keep a sharp look-out i promise you' curdie was the only one who remained in the mine  about six o'clock the rest went away everyone bidding him good night and telling him to take care of himself for he was a great favourite with them all  'don't forget your rhymes' said one  'no no'answered curdie  'it's no matter if he does' said another 'for he'll only have to make a new one'  'yes  but he mightn't be able to make it fast enough' said another 'and while it was cooking in his head they might take a mean advantage and set upon him'  'i'll do my best' said curdie  'i'm not afraid' 'we all know that' they returned and left him    chapter 8  the goblins  for some time curdie worked away briskly throwing all the ore he had disengaged on one side behind him to be ready for carrying out in the morning  he heard a good deal of goblin-tapping but it all sounded far away in the hill and he paid it little heed  towards midnight he began to feel rather hungry so he dropped his pickaxe got out a lump of bread which in the morning he had laid in a damp hole in the rock sat down on a heap of ore and ate his supper then he leaned back for five minutes' rest before beginning his work again and laid his head against the rock  he had not kept the position for one minute before he heard something which made him sharpen his ears  it sounded like a voice inside the rock after a while he heard it again  it was a goblin voice there could be no doubt about that and this time he could make out the words  'hadn't we better be moving'it said  a rougher and deeper voice replied   'there's no hurry  that wretched little mole won't be through tonight if he work ever so hard  he's not by any means at the thinnest place'  'but you still think the lode does come through into our house' said the first voice  'yes but a good bit farther on than he has got to yet  if he had struck a stroke more to the side just here' said the goblin tapping the very stone as it seemed to curdie against which his head lay 'he would have been through but he's a couple of yards past it now and if he follow the lode it will be a week before it leads him in  you see it back there a long way  still perhaps in case of accident it would be as well to be getting out of this helfer you'll take the great chest  that's your business you know'  'yes dad' said a third voice  'but you must help me to get it on my back  it's awfully heavy you know'  'well it isn't just a bag of smoke i admit  but you're as strong as a mountain helfer'  'you say so dad  i think myself i'm all right  but i could carry ten times as much if it wasn't for my feet'  'that is your weak point i confess my boy' 'ain't it yours too father'  'well to be honest it's a goblin weakness  why they come so soft i declare i haven't an idea'  'specially when your head's so hard you know father'  'yes my boy  the goblin's glory is his head  to think how the fellows up above there have to put on helmets and things when they go fighting ha ha'  'but why don't we wear shoes like them father  i should like it especially when i've got a chest like that on my head'  'well you see it's not the fashion  the king never wears shoes'  'the queen does'  'yes but that's for distinction  the first queen you see i mean the king's first wife wore shoes of course because she came from upstairs and so when she died the next queen would not be inferior to her as she called it and would wear shoes too  it was all pride she is the hardest in forbidding them to the rest of the women'  'i'm sure i wouldn't wear them no not for that i wouldn't' said the first voice which was evidently that of the mother of the family  'i can't think why either of them should'  'didn't i tell you the first was from upstairs' said the other 'that was the only silly thing i ever knew his majesty guilty of why should he marry an outlandish woman like that-one of our natural enemies too'  'i suppose he fell in love with her' 'pooh pooh  he's just as happy now with one of his own people'  'did she die very soon  they didn't tease her to death did they'  'oh dear no  the king worshipped her very footmarks'  'what made her die then  didn't the air agree with her'  'she died when the young prince was born'  'how silly of her  we never do that  it must have been because she wore shoes'  'i don't know that'  'why do they wear shoes up there'  'ah now that's a sensible question and i will answer it  but in order to do so i must first tell you a secret  i once saw the queen's feet'  'without her shoes'  'yes without her shoes'  'no  did you  how was it'  'never you mind how it was  she didn't know i saw them  and what do you think they had toes'  'toes  what's that'  'you may well ask  i should never have known if i had not seen the queen's feet  just imagine the ends of her feet were split up into five or six thin pieces'  'oh horrid  how could the king have fallen in love with her'  'you forget that she wore shoes  that is just why she wore them that is why all the men and women too upstairs wear shoes  they can't bear the sight of their own feet without them'  'ah now i understand  if ever you wish for shoes again helfer i'll hit your feet i will'  'no no mother pray don't'  'then don't you'  'but with such a big box on my head '  a horrid scream followed which curdie interpreted as in reply to a blow from his mother upon the feet of her eldest goblin  'well i never knew so much before' remarked a fourth voice  'your knowledge is not universal quite yet' said the father  'you were only fifty last month  mind you see to the bed and bedding as soon as we've finished our supper we'll be up and going  ha ha ha'  'what are you laughing at husband'  'i'm laughing to think what a mess the miners will find themselves in somewhere before this day ten years'  'why what do you mean'  'oh nothing'  'oh yes you do mean something  you always do mean something'  'it's more than you do then wife' 'that may be but it's not more than i find out you know'  'ha ha  you're a sharp one  what a mother you've got helfer'  'yes father'  'well i suppose i must tell you  they're all at the palace consulting about it tonight and as soon as we've got away from this thin place i'm going there to hear what night they fix upon i should like to see that young ruffian there on the other side struggling in the agonies of '  he dropped his voice so low that curdie could hear only a growl the growl went on in the low bass for a good while as inarticulate as if the goblin's tongue had been a sausage and it was not until his wife spoke again that it rose to its former pitch  'but what shall we do when you are at the palace' she asked  'i will see you safe in the new house i've been digging for you for the last two months  podge you mind the table and chairs  i commit them to your care  the table has seven legs each chair three  i shall require them all at your hands'  after this arose a confused conversation about the various household goods and their transport and curdie heard nothing more that was of any importance  he now knew at least one of the reasons for the constant sound of the goblin hammers and pickaxes at night  they were making new houses for themselves to which they might retreat when the miners should threaten to break into their dwellings  but he had learned two things of far greater importance  the first was that some grievous calamity was preparing and almost ready to fall upon the heads of the miners the second was the one weak point of a goblin's body he had not known that their feet were so tender as he had now reason to suspect  he had heard it said that they had no toes  he had never had opportunity of inspecting them closely enough in the dusk in which they always appeared to satisfy himself whether it was a correct report  indeed he had not been able even to satisfy himself as to whether they had no fingers although that also was commonly said to be the fact  one of the miners indeed who had had more schooling than the rest was wont to argue that such must have been the primordial condition of humanity and that education and handicraft had developed both toes and fingers with which proposition curdie had once heard his father sarcastically agree alleging in support of it the probability that babies' gloves were a traditional remnant of the old state of things while the stockings of all ages no regard being paid in them to the toes pointed in the same direction  but what was of importance was the fact concerning the softness of the goblin feet which he foresaw might be useful to all miners  what he had to do in the meantime however was to discover if possible the special evil design the goblins had now in their heads  although he knew all the gangs and all the natural galleries with which they communicated in the mined part of the mountain he had not the least idea where the palace of the king of the gnomes was otherwise he would have set out at once on the enterprise of discovering what the said design was  he judged and rightly that it must lie in a farther part of the mountain between which and the mine there was as yet no communication  there must be one nearly completed however for it could be but a thin partition which now separated them  if only he could get through in time to follow the goblins as they retreated  a few blows would doubtless be sufficient just where his ear now lay but if he attempted to strike there with his pickaxe he would only hasten the departure of the family put them on their guard and perhaps lose their involuntary guidance  he therefore began to feel the wall with his hands and soon found that some of the stones were loose enough to be drawn out with little noise  laying hold of a large one with both his hands he drew it gently out and let it down softly  'what was that noise' said the goblin father  curdie blew out his light lest it should shine through  'it must be that one miner that stayed behind the rest' said the mother  'no he's been gone a good while  i haven't heard a blow for an hour besides it wasn't like that'  'then i suppose it must have been a stone carried down the brook inside'  'perhaps  it will have more room by and by'  curdie kept quite still  after a little while hearing nothing but the sounds of their preparations for departure mingled with an occasional word of direction and anxious to know whether the removal of the stone had made an opening into the goblins' house he put in his hand to feel  it went in a good way and then came in contact with something soft  he had but a moment to feel it over it was so quickly withdrawn  it was one of the toeless goblin feet  the owner of it gave a cry of fright  'what's the matter helfer' asked his mother  'a beast came out of the wall and licked my foot'  'nonsense  there are no wild beasts in our country' said his father  'but it was father  i felt it'  'nonsense i say  will you malign your native realms and reduce them to a level with the country upstairs  that is swarming with wild beasts of every description'  'but i did feel it father'  'i tell you to hold your tongue  you are no patriot'  curdie suppressed his laughter and lay still as a mouse but no stiller for every moment he kept nibbling away with his fingers at the edges of the hole  he was slowly making it bigger for here the rock had been very much shattered with the blasting  there seemed to be a good many in the family to judge from the mass of confused talk which now and then came through the hole but when all were speaking together and just as if they had bottle-brushes each at least one in their throats it was not easy to make out much that was said  at length he heard once more what the father goblin was saying  'now then' he said 'get your bundles on your backs  here helfer i'll help you up with your chest'  'i wish it was my chest father'  'your turn will come in good time enough  make haste  i must go to the meeting at the palace tonight  when that's over we can come back and clear out the last of the things before our enemies return in the morning  now light your torches and come along what a distinction it is to provide our own light instead of being dependent on a thing hung up in the air a most disagreeable contrivance intended no doubt to blind us when we venture out under its baleful influence  quite glaring and vulgar i call it though no doubt useful to poor creatures who haven't the wit to make light for themselves'  curdie could hardly keep himself from calling through to know whether they made the fire to light their torches by  but a moment's reflection showed him that they would have said they did inasmuch as they struck two stones together and the fire came    chapter 9  the hall of the goblin palace  a sound of many soft feet followed but soon ceased  then curdie flew at the hole like a tiger and tore and pulled  the sides gave way and it was soon large enough for him to crawl through  he would not betray himself by rekindling his lamp but the torches of the retreating company which he found departing in a straight line up a long avenue from the door of their cave threw back light enough to afford him a glance round the deserted home of the goblins  to his surprise he could discover nothing to distinguish it from an ordinary natural cave in the rock upon many of which he had come with the rest of the miners in the progress of their excavations  the goblins had talked of coming back for the rest of their household gear  he saw nothing that would have made him suspect a family had taken shelter there for a single night  the floor was rough and stony the walls full of projecting corners the roof in one place twenty feet high in another endangering his forehead while on one side a stream no thicker than a needle it is true but still sufficient to spread a wide dampness over the wall flowed down the face of the rock  but the troop in front of him was toiling under heavy burdens  he could distinguish helfer now and then in the flickering light and shade with his heavy chest on his bending shoulders while the second brother was almost buried in what looked like a great feather bed  'where do they get the feathers' thought curdie but in a moment the troop disappeared at a turn of the way and it was now both safe and necessary for curdie to follow them lest they should be round the next turning before he saw them again for so he might lose them altogether  he darted after them like a greyhound when he reached the corner and looked cautiously round he saw them again at some distance down another long passage  none of the galleries he saw that night bore signs of the work of man or of goblin either  stalactites far older than the mines hung from their roofs and their floors were rough with boulders and large round stones showing that there water must have once run  he waited again at this corner till they had disappeared round the next and so followed them a long way through one passage after another  the passages grew more and more lofty and were more and more covered in the roof with shining stalactites  it was a strange enough procession which he followed  but the strangest part of it was the household animals which crowded amongst the feet of the goblins  it was true they had no wild animals down there at least they did not know of any but they had a wonderful number of tame ones  i must however reserve any contributions towards the natural history of these for a later position in my story  at length turning a corner too abruptly he had almost rushed into the middle of the goblin family for there they had already set down all their burdens on the floor of a cave considerably larger than that which they had left  they were as yet too breathless to speak else he would have had warning of their arrest  he started back however before anyone saw him and retreating a good way stood watching till the father should come out to go to the palace  before very long both he and his son helfer appeared and kept on in the same direction as before while curdie followed them again with renewed precaution  for a long time he heard no sound except something like the rush of a river inside the rock but at length what seemed the far-off noise of a great shouting reached his ears which however presently ceased  after advancing a good way farther he thought he heard a single voice  it sounded clearer and clearer as he went on until at last he could almost distinguish the words  in a moment or two keeping after the goblins round another corner he once more started back this time in amazement  he was at the entrance of a magnificent cavern of an oval shape once probably a huge natural reservoir of water now the great palace hall of the goblins  it rose to a tremendous height but the roof was composed of such shining materials and the multitude of torches carried by the goblins who crowded the floor lighted up the place so brilliantly that curdie could see to the top quite well  but he had no idea how immense the place was until his eyes had got accustomed to it which was not for a good many minutes the rough projections on the walls and the shadows thrown upwards from them by the torches made the sides of the chamber look as if they were crowded with statues upon brackets and pedestals reaching in irregular tiers from floor to roof the walls themselves were in many parts of gloriously shining substances some of them gorgeously coloured besides which powerfully contrasted with the shadows  curdie could not help wondering whether his rhymes would be of any use against such a multitude of goblins as filled the floor of the hall and indeed felt considerably tempted to begin his shout of 'one two three' but as there was no reason for routing them and much for endeavouring to discover their designs he kept himself perfectly quiet and peering round the edge of the doorway listened with both his sharp ears  at the other end of the hall high above the heads of the multitude was a terrace-like ledge of considerable height caused by the receding of the upper part of the cavern-wall  upon this sat the king and his court  the king on a throne hollowed out of a huge block of green copper ore and his court upon lower seats around it  the king had been making them a speech and the applause which followed it was what curdie had heard  one of the court was now addressing the multitude what he heard him say was to the following effect  'hence it appears that two plans have been for some time together working in the strong head of his majesty for the deliverance of his people  regardless of the fact that we were the first possessors of the regions they now inhabit regardless equally of the fact that we abandoned that region from the loftiest motives regardless also of the self-evident fact that we excel them so far in mental ability as they excel us in stature they look upon us as a degraded race and make a mockery of all our finer feelings  but the time has almost arrived when thanks to his majesty's inventive genius it will be in our power to take a thorough revenge upon them once for all in respect of their unfriendly behaviour'  'may it please your majesty ' cried a voice close by the door which curdie recognized as that of the goblin he had followed  'who is he that interrupts the chancellor' cried another from near the throne  'glump' answered several voices  'he is our trusty subject' said the king himself in a slow and stately voice  'let him come forward and speak'  a lane was parted through the crowd and glump having ascended the platform and bowed to the king spoke as follows   'sire i would have held my peace had i not known that i only knew how near was the moment to which the chancellor had just referred  in all probability before another day is past the enemy will have broken through into my house the partition between being even now not more than a foot in thickness'  'not quite so much' thought curdie to himself  'this very evening i have had to remove my household effects therefore the sooner we are ready to carry out the plan for the execution of which his majesty has been making such magnificent preparations the better  i may just add that within the last few days i have perceived a small outbreak in my dining-room which combined with observations upon the course of the river escaping where the evil men enter has convinced me that close to the spot must be a deep gulf in its channel this discovery will i trust add considerably to the otherwise immense forces at his majesty's disposal'  he ceased and the king graciously acknowledged his speech with a bend of his head whereupon glump after a bow to his majesty slid down amongst the rest of the undistinguished multitude  then the chancellor rose and resumed  'the information which the worthy glump has given us' he said 'might have been of considerable import at the present moment but for that other design already referred to which naturally takes precedence his majesty unwilling to proceed to extremities and well aware that such measures sooner or later result in violent reactions has excogitated a more fundamental and comprehensive measure of which i need say no more  should his majesty be successful as who dares to doubt then a peace all to the advantage of the goblin kingdom will be established for a generation at least rendered absolutely secure by the pledge which his royal highness the prince will have and hold for the good behaviour of her relatives  should his majesty fail which who shall dare even to imagine in his most secret thoughts then will be the time for carrying out with rigour the design to which glump referred and for which our preparations are even now all but completed  the failure of the former will render the latter imperative'  curdie perceiving that the assembly was drawing to a close and that there was little chance of either plan being more fully discovered now thought it prudent to make his escape before the goblins began to disperse and slipped quietly away  there was not much danger of meeting any goblins for all the men at least were left behind him in the palace but there was considerable danger of his taking a wrong turning for he had now no light and had therefore to depend upon his memory and his hands  after he had left behind him the glow that issued from the door of glump's new abode he was utterly without guide so far as his eyes were concerned  he was most anxious to get back through the hole before the goblins should return to fetch the remains of their furniture  it was not that he was in the least afraid of them but as it was of the utmost importance that he should thoroughly discover what the plans they were cherishing were he must not occasion the slightest suspicion that they were watched by a miner  he hurried on feeling his way along the walls of rock  had he not been very courageous he must have been very anxious for he could not but know that if he lost his way it would be the most difficult thing in the world to find it again  morning would bring no light into these regions and towards him least of all who was known as a special rhymester and persecutor could goblins be expected to exercise courtesy  well might he wish that he had brought his lamp and tinder-box with him of which he had not thought when he crept so eagerly after the goblins  he wished it all the more when after a while he found his way blocked up and could get no farther  it was of no use to turn back for he had not the least idea where he had begun to go wrong  mechanically however he kept feeling about the walls that hemmed him in  his hand came upon a place where a tiny stream of water was running down the face of the rock  'what a stupid i am' he said to himself  'i am actually at the end of my journey and there are the goblins coming back to fetch their things' he added as the red glimmer of their torches appeared at the end of the long avenue that led up to the cave  in a moment he had thrown himself on the floor and wriggled backwards through the hole  the floor on the other side was several feet lower which made it easier to get back it was all he could do to lift the largest stone he had taken out of the hole but he did manage to shove it in again  he sat down on the ore-heap and thought  he was pretty sure that the latter plan of the goblins was to inundate the mine by breaking outlets for the water accumulated in the natural reservoirs of the mountain as well as running through portions of it while the part hollowed by the miners remained shut off from that inhabited by the goblins they had had no opportunity of injuring them thus but now that a passage was broken through and the goblins' part proved the higher in the mountain it was clear to curdie that the mine could be destroyed in an hour  water was always the chief danger to which the miners were exposed  they met with a little choke-damp sometimes but never with the explosive firedamp so common in coal-mines  hence they were careful as soon as they saw any appearance of water as the result of his reflections while the goblins were busy in their old home it seemed to curdie that it would be best to build up the whole of this gang filling it with stone and clay or lie so that there should be no smallest channel for the water to get into there was not however any immediate danger for the execution of the goblins' plan was contingent upon the failure of that unknown design which was to take precedence of it and he was most anxious to keep the door of communication open that he might if possible discover what the former plan was  at the same time they could not resume their intermitted labours for the inundation without his finding it out when by putting all hands to the work the one existing outlet might in a single night be rendered impenetrable to any weight of water for by filling the gang entirely up their embankment would be buttressed by the sides of the mountain itself  as soon as he found that the goblins had again retired he lighted his lamp and proceeded to fill the hole he had made with such stones as he could withdraw when he pleased  he then thought it better as he might have occasion to be up a good many nights after this to go home and have some sleep  how pleasant the night air felt upon the outside of the mountain after what he had gone through in the inside of it  he hurried up the hill without meeting a single goblin on the way and called and tapped at the window until he woke his father who soon rose and let him in  he told him the whole story and just as he had expected his father thought it best to work that lode no farther but at the same time to pretend occasionally to be at work there still in order that the goblins might have no suspicions  both father and son then went to bed and slept soundly until the morning    chapter 10  the princess's king-papa  the weather continued fine for weeks and the little princess went out every day  so long a period of fine weather had indeed never been known upon that mountain  the only uncomfortable thing was that her nurse was so nervous and particular about being in before the sun was down that often she would take to her heels when nothing worse than a fleecy cloud crossing the sun threw a shadow on the hillside and many an evening they were home a full hour before the sunlight had left the weather-cock on the stables  if it had not been for such odd behaviour irene would by this time have almost forgotten the goblins  she never forgot curdie but him she remembered for his own sake and indeed would have remembered him if only because a princess never forgets her debts until they are paid  one splendid sunshiny day about an hour after noon irene who was playing on a lawn in the garden heard the distant blast of a bugle she jumped up with a cry of joy for she knew by that particular blast that her father was on his way to see her  this part of the garden lay on the slope of the hill and allowed a full view of the country below so she shaded her eyes with her hand and looked far away to catch the first glimpse of shining armour in a few moments a little troop came glittering round the shoulder of a hill  spears and helmets were sparkling and gleaming banners were flying horses prancing and again came the bugle-blast which was to her like the voice of her father calling across the distance  'irene i'm coming'  on and on they came until she could clearly distinguish the king he rode a white horse and was taller than any of the men with him he wore a narrow circle of gold set with jewels around his helmet and as he came still nearer irene could discern the flashing of the stones in the sun  it was a long time since he had been to see her and her little heart beat faster and faster as the shining troop approached for she loved her king-papa very dearly and was nowhere so happy as in his arms  when they reached a certain point after which she could see them no more from the garden she ran to the gate and there stood till up they came clanging and stamping with one more bright bugle-blast which said  'irene i am come'  by this time the people of the house were all gathered at the gate but irene stood alone in front of them  when the horsemen pulled up she ran to the side of the white horse and held up her arms the king stopped and took her hands  in an instant she was on the saddle and clasped in his great strong arms  i wish i could describe the king so that you could see him in your mind  he had gentle blue eyes but a nose that made him look like an eagle  a long dark beard streaked with silvery lines flowed from his mouth almost to his waist and as irene sat on the saddle and hid her glad face upon his bosom it mingled with the golden hair which her mother had given her and the two together were like a cloud with streaks of the sun woven through it  after he had held her to his heart for a minute he spoke to his white horse and the great beautiful creature which had been prancing so proudly a little while before walked as gently as a lady for he knew he had a little lady on his back through the gate and up to the door of the house  then the king set her on the ground and dismounting took her hand and walked with her into the great hall which was hardly ever entered except when he came to see his little princess  there he sat down with two of his counsellors who had accompanied him to have some refreshment and irene sat on his right hand and drank her milk out of a wooden bowl curiously carved  after the king had eaten and drunk he turned to the princess and said stroking her hair   'now my child what shall we do next'  this was the question he almost always put to her first after their meal together and irene had been waiting for it with some impatience for now she thought she should be able to settle a question which constantly perplexed her  'i should like you to take me to see my great old grandmother'  the king looked grave and said   'what does my little daughter mean'  'i mean the queen irene that lives up in the tower the very old lady you know with the long hair of silver'  the king only gazed at his little princess with a look which she could not understand  'she's got her crown in her bedroom' she went on 'but i've not been in there yet  you know she's there don't you'  'no' said the king very quietly  'then it must all be a dream' said irene  'i half thought it was but i couldn't be sure  now i am sure of it  besides i couldn't find her the next time i went up'  at that moment a snow-white pigeon flew in at an open window and settled upon irene's head  she broke into a merry laugh cowered a little and put up her hands to her head saying   'dear dovey don't peck me  you'll pull out my hair with your long claws if you don't mind'  the king stretched out his hand to take the pigeon but it spread its wings and flew again through the open window when its whiteness made one flash in the sun and vanished  the king laid his hand on his princess's head held it back a little gazed in her face smiled half a smile and sighed half a sigh  'come my child we'll have a walk in the garden together' he said  'you won't come up and see my huge great beautiful grandmother then king-papa' said the princess  'not this time' said the king very gently  'she has not invited me you know and great old ladies like her do not choose to be visited without leave asked and given'  the garden was a very lovely place  being upon a mountainside there were parts in it where the rocks came through in great masses and all immediately about them remained quite wild  tufts of heather grew upon them and other hardy mountain plants and flowers while near them would be lovely roses and lilies and all pleasant garden flowers  this mingling of the wild mountain with the civilized garden was very quaint and it was impossible for any number of gardeners to make such a garden look formal and stiff  against one of these rocks was a garden seat shadowed from the afternoon sun by the overhanging of the rock itself  there was a little winding path up to the top of the rock and on top another seat but they sat on the seat at its foot because the sun was hot and there they talked together of many things  at length the king said   'you were out late one evening irene'  'yes papa  it was my fault and lootie was very sorry'  'i must talk to lootie about it' said the king  'don't speak loud to her please papa' said irene  'she's been so afraid of being late ever since  indeed she has not been naughty  it was only a mistake for once'  'once might be too often' murmured the king to himself as he stroked his child's head  i can't tell you how he had come to know  i am sure curdie had not told him  someone about the palace must have seen them after all  he sat for a good while thinking  there was no sound to be heard except that of a little stream which ran merrily out of an opening in the rock by where they sat and sped away down the hill through the garden  then he rose and leaving irene where she was went into the house and sent for lootie with whom he had a talk that made her cry  when in the evening he rode away upon his great white horse he left six of his attendants behind him with orders that three of them should watch outside the house every night walking round and round it from sunset to sunrise  it was clear he was not quite comfortable about the princess    chapter 11  the old lady's bedroom  nothing more happened worth telling for some time  the autumn came and went by  there were no more flowers in the garden  the wind blew strong and howled among the rocks  the rain fell and drenched the few yellow and red leaves that could not get off the bare branches again and again there would be a glorious morning followed by a pouring afternoon and sometimes for a week together there would be rain nothing but rain all day and then the most lovely cloudless night with the sky all out in full-blown stars not one missing  but the princess could not see much of them for she went to bed early  the winter drew on and she found things growing dreary  when it was too stormy to go out and she had got tired of her toys lootie would take her about the house sometimes to the housekeeper's room where the housekeeper who was a good kind old woman made much of her sometimes to the servants' hall or the kitchen where she was not princess merely but absolute queen and ran a great risk of being spoiled sometimes she would run off herself to the room where the men-at-arms whom the king had left sat and they showed her their arms and accoutrements and did what they could to amuse her  still at times she found it very dreary and often and often wished that her huge great grandmother had not been a dream  one morning the nurse left her with the housekeeper for a while to amuse her she turned out the contents of an old cabinet upon the table the little princess found her treasures queer ancient ornaments and many things the use of which she could not imagine far more interesting than her own toys and sat playing with them for two hours or more  but at length in handling a curious old-fashioned brooch she ran the pin of it into her thumb and gave a little scream with the sharpness of the pain but would have thought little more of it had not the pain increased and her thumb begun to swell  this alarmed the housekeeper greatly  the nurse was fetched the doctor was sent for her hand was poulticed and long before her usual time she was put to bed  the pain still continued and although she fell asleep and dreamed a good many dreams there was the pain always in every dream at last it woke her up  the moon was shining brightly into the room  the poultice had fallen off her hand and it was burning hot  she fancied if she could hold it into the moonlight that would cool it  so she got out of bed without waking the nurse who lay at the other end of the room and went to the window  when she looked out she saw one of the men-at-arms walking in the garden with the moonlight glancing on his armour  she was just going to tap on the window and call him for she wanted to tell him all about it when she bethought herself that that might wake lootie and she would put her into her bed again  so she resolved to go to the window of another room and call him from there  it was so much nicer to have somebody to talk to than to lie awake in bed with the burning pain in her hand  she opened the door very gently and went through the nursery which did not look into the garden to go to the other window but when she came to the foot of the old staircase there was the moon shining down from some window high up and making the worm-eaten oak look very strange and delicate and lovely  in a moment she was putting her little feet one after the other in the silvery path up the stair looking behind as she went to see the shadow they made in the middle of the silver  some little girls would have been afraid to find themselves thus alone in the middle of the night but irene was a princess  as she went slowly up the stair not quite sure that she was not dreaming suddenly a great longing woke up in her heart to try once more whether she could not find the old lady with the silvery hair 'if she is a dream' she said to herself 'then i am the likelier to find her if i am dreaming'  so up and up she went stair after stair until she came to the many rooms all just as she had seen them before  through passage after passage she softly sped comforting herself that if she should lose her way it would not matter much because when she woke she would find herself in her own bed with lootie not far off but as if she had known every step of the way she walked straight to the door at the foot of the narrow stair that led to the tower  'what if i should realreality-really find my beautiful old grandmother up there' she said to herself as she crept up the steep steps  when she reached the top she stood a moment listening in the dark for there was no moon there  yes it was it was the hum of the spinning-wheel  what a diligent grandmother to work both day and night  she tapped gently at the door  'come in irene'said the sweet voice  the princess opened the door and entered  there was the moonlight streaming in at the window and in the middle of the moonlight sat the old lady in her black dress with the white lace and her silvery hair mingling with the moonlight so that you could not have told which was which  'come in irene' she said again  'can you tell me what i am spinning'  'she speaks' thought irene 'just as if she had seen me five minutes ago or yesterday at the farthest  no' she answered 'i don't know what you are spinning  please i thought you were a dream  why couldn't i find you before great-great-grandmother'  'that you are hardly old enough to understand  but you would have found me sooner if you hadn't come to think i was a dream  i will give you one reason though why you couldn't find me  i didn't want you to find me'  'why please'  'because i did not want lootie to know i was here'  'but you told me to tell lootie'  'yes  but i knew lootie would not believe you  if she were to see me sitting spinning here she wouldn't believe me either'  'why'  'because she couldn't  she would rub her eyes and go away and say she felt queer and forget half of it and more and then say it had been all a dream'  'just like me' said irene feeling very much ashamed of herself  'yes a good deal like you but not just like you for you've come again and lootie wouldn't have come again  she would have said no no she had had enough of such nonsense'  'is it naughty of lootie then'  'it would be naughty of you  i've never done anything for lootie'  'and you did wash my face and hands for me' said irene beginning to cry  the old lady smiled a sweet smile and said   'i'm not vexed with you my child nor with lootie either  but i don't want you to say anything more to lootie about me  if she should ask you you must just be silent  but i do not think she will ask you'  all the time they talked the old lady kept on spinning  'you haven't told me yet what i am spinning' she said  'because i don't know  it's very pretty stuff'  it was indeed very pretty stuff  there was a good bunch of it on the distaff attached to the spinning-wheel and in the moonlight it shone like what shall i say it was like  it was not white enough for silver yes it was like silver but shone grey rather than white and glittered only a little  and the thread the old lady drew out from it was so fine that irene could hardly see it 'i am spinning this for you my child'  'for me  what am i to do with it please'  'i will tell you by and by  but first i will tell you what it is it is spider-web of a particular kind  my pigeons bring it me from over the great sea  there is only one forest where the spiders live who make this particular kind the finest and strongest of any  i have nearly finished my present job  what is on the rock now will be enough  i have a week's work there yet though' she added looking at the bunch  'do you work all day and all night too great-great-great-great-grandmother' said the princess thinking to be very polite with so many greats  'i am not quite so great as all that' she answered smiling almost merrily  'if you call me grandmother that will do  no i don't work every night only moonlit nights and then no longer than the moon shines upon my wheel  i shan't work much longer tonight'  'and what will you do next grandmother' 'go to bed  would you like to see my bedroom'  'yes that i should'  'then i think i won't work any longer tonight  i shall be in good time'  the old lady rose and left her wheel standing just as it was  you see there was no good in putting it away for where there was not any furniture there was no danger of being untidy  then she took irene by the hand but it was her bad hand and irene gave a little cry of pain  'my child' said her grandmother 'what is the matter'  irene held her hand into the moonlight that the old lady might see it and told her all about it at which she looked grave  but she only said  'give me your other hand' and having led her out upon the little dark landing opened the door on the opposite side of it  what was irene's surprise to see the loveliest room she had ever seen in her life  it was large and lofty and dome-shaped from the centre hung a lamp as round as a ball shining as if with the brightest moonlight which made everything visible in the room though not so clearly that the princess could tell what many of the things were  a large oval bed stood in the middle with a coverlid of rose colour and velvet curtains all round it of a lovely pale blue  the walls were also blue spangled all over with what looked like stars of silver  the old lady left her and going to a strange-looking cabinet opened it and took out a curious silver casket  then she sat down on a low chair and calling irene made her kneel before her while she looked at her hand  having examined it she opened the casket and took from it a little ointment  the sweetest odour filled the room like that of roses and lilies as she rubbed the ointment gently all over the hot swollen hand  her touch was so pleasant and cool that it seemed to drive away the pain and heat wherever it came  'oh grandmother it is so nice' said irene  'thank you thank you'  then the old lady went to a chest of drawers and took out a large handkerchief of gossamer-like cambric which she tied round her hand  'i don't think i can let you go away tonight' she said  'would you like to sleep with me'  'oh yes yes dear grandmother' said irene and would have clapped her hands forgetting that she could not  'you won't be afraid then to go to bed with such an old woman'  'no  you are so beautiful grandmother'  'but i am very old'  'and i suppose i am very young  you won't mind sleeping with such a very young woman grandmother'  'you sweet little pertness' said the old lady and drew her towards her and kissed her on the forehead and the cheek and the mouth  then she got a large silver basin and having poured some water into it made irene sit on the chair and washed her feet this done she was ready for bed  and oh what a delicious bed it was into which her grandmother laid her  she hardly could have told she was lying upon anything  she felt nothing but the softness  the old lady having undressed herself lay down beside her  'why don't you put out your moon' asked the princess  'that never goes out night or day' she answered  'in the darkest night if any of my pigeons are out on a message they always see my moon and know where to fly to'  'but if somebody besides the pigeons were to see it somebody about the house i mean they would come to look what it was and find you'  'the better for them then' said the old lady  'but it does not happen above five times in a hundred years that anyone does see it  the greater part of those who do take it for a meteor wink their eyes and forget it again  besides nobody could find the room except i pleased  besides again i will tell you a secret if that light were to go out you would fancy yourself lying in a bare garret on a heap of old straw and would not see one of the pleasant things round about you all the time'  'i hope it will never go out' said the princess  'i hope not  but it is time we both went to sleep  shall i take you in my arms'  the little princess nestled close up to the old lady who took her in both her arms and held her close to her bosom  'oh dear this is so nice' said the princess  'i didn't know anything in the world could be so comfortable  i should like to lie here for ever'  'you may if you will' said the old lady  'but i must put you to one trial-not a very hard one i hope  this night week you must come back to me  if you don't i do not know when you may find me again and you will soon want me very much'  'oh please don't let me forget'  'you shall not forget  the only question is whether you will believe i am anywhere whether you will believe i am anything but a dream  you may be sure i will do all i can to help you to come but it will rest with yourself after all  on the night of next friday you must come to me  mind now'  'i will try' said the princess  'then good night' said the old lady and kissed the forehead which lay in her bosom  in a moment more the little princess was dreaming in the midst of the loveliest dreams of summer seas and moonlight and mossy springs and great murmuring trees and beds of wild flowers with such odours as she had never smelled before  but after all no dream could be more lovely than what she had left behind when she fell asleep  in the morning she found herself in her own bed  there was no handkerchief or anything else on her hand only a sweet odour lingered about it  the swelling had all gone down the prick of the brooch had vanished in fact her hand was perfectly well    chapter 12  a short chapter about curdie  curdie spent many nights in the mine  his father and he had taken mrs peterson into the secret for they knew mother could hold her tongue which was more than could be said of all the miners' wives  but curdie did not tell her that every night he spent in the mine part of it went in earning a new red petticoat for her  mrs peterson was such a nice good mother  all mothers are nice and good more or less but mrs peterson was nice and good all more and no less  she made and kept a little heaven in that poor cottage on the high hillside for her husband and son to go home to out of the low and rather dreary earth in which they worked  i doubt if the princess was very much happier even in the arms of her huge great-grandmother than peter and curdie were in the arms of mrs peterson  true her hands were hard and chapped and large but it was with work for them and therefore in the sight of the angels her hands were so much the more beautiful  and if curdie worked hard to get her a petticoat she worked hard every day to get him comforts which he would have missed much more than she would a new petticoat even in winter  not that she and curdie ever thought of how much they worked for each other  that would have spoiled everything  when left alone in the mine curdie always worked on for an hour or two at first following the lode which according to glump would lead at last into the deserted habitation  after that he would set out on a reconnoitring expedition  in order to manage this or rather the return from it better than the first time he had bought a huge ball of fine string having learned the trick from hop-o'-my-thumb whose history his mother had often told him  not that hop-o'-my-thumb had ever used a ball of string i should be sorry to be supposed so far out in my classics but the principle was the same as that of the pebbles the end of this string he fastened to his pickaxe which figured no bad anchor and then with the ball in his hand unrolling it as he went set out in the dark through the natural gangs of the goblins' territory  the first night or two he came upon nothing worth remembering saw only a little of the home-life of the cobs in the various caves they called houses failed in coming upon anything to cast light upon the foregoing design which kept the inundation for the present in the background  but at length i think on the third or fourth night he found partly guided by the noise of their implements a company of evidently the best sappers and miners amongst them hard at work  what were they about  it could not well be the inundation seeing that had in the meantime been postponed to something else  then what was it  he lurked and watched every now and then in the greatest risk of being detected but without success  he had again and again to retreat in haste a proceeding rendered the more difficult that he had to gather up his string as he returned upon its course  it was not that he was afraid of the goblins but that he was afraid of their finding out that they were watched which might have prevented the discovery at which he aimed  sometimes his haste had to be such that when he reached home towards morning his string for lack of time to wind it up as he 'dodged the cobs' would be in what seemed most hopeless entanglement but after a good sleep though a short one he always found his mother had got it right again  there it was wound in a most respectable ball ready for use the moment he should want it  'i can't think how you do it mother' he would say  'i follow the thread' she would answer 'just as you do in the mine' she never had more to say about it but the less clever she was with her words the more clever she was with her hands and the less his mother said the more curdie believed she had to say  but still he had made no discovery as to what the goblin miners were about    chapter 13  the cobs' creatures  about this time the gentlemen whom the king had left behind him to watch over the princess had each occasion to doubt the testimony of his own eyes for more than strange were the objects to which they would bear witness  they were of one sort creatures but so grotesque and misshapen as to be more like a child's drawings upon his slate than anything natural  they saw them only at night while on guard about the house  the testimony of the man who first reported having seen one of them was that as he was walking slowly round the house while yet in the shadow he caught sight of a creature standing on its hind legs in the moonlight with its forefeet upon a window-ledge staring in at the window  its body might have been that of a dog or wolf he thought but he declared on his honour that its head was twice the size it ought to have been for the size of its body and as round as a ball while the face which it turned upon him as it fled was more like one carved by a boy upon the turnip inside which he is going to put a candle than anything else he could think of  it rushed into the garden he sent an arrow after it and thought he must have struck it for it gave an unearthly howl and he could not find his arrow any more than the beast although he searched all about the place where it vanished  they laughed at him until he was driven to hold his tongue and said he must have taken too long a pull at the ale-jug  but before two nights were over he had one to side with him for he too had seen something strange only quite different from that reported by the other  the description the second man gave of the creature he had seen was yet more grotesque and unlikely  they were both laughed at by the rest but night after night another came over to their side until at last there was only one left to laugh at all his companions  two nights more passed and he saw nothing but on the third he came rushing from the garden to the other two before the house in such an agitation that they declared for it was their turn now that the band of his helmet was cracking under his chin with the rising of his hair inside it running with him into that part of the garden which i have already described they saw a score of creatures to not one of which they could give a name and not one of which was like another hideous and ludicrous at once gambolling on the lawn in the moonlight the supernatural or rather subnatural ugliness of their faces the length of legs and necks in some the apparent absence of both or either in others made the spectators although in one consent as to what they saw yet doubtful as i have said of the evidence of their own eyes and ears as well for the noises they made although not loud were as uncouth and varied as their forms and could be described neither as grunts nor squeaks nor roars nor howls nor barks nor yells nor screams nor croaks nor hisses nor mews nor shrieks but only as something like all of them mingled in one horrible dissonance keeping in the shade the watchers had a few moments to recover themselves before the hideous assembly suspected their presence but all at once as if by common consent they scampered off in the direction of a great rock and vanished before the men had come to themselves sufficiently to think of following them  my readers will suspect what these were but i will now give them full information concerning them  they were of course household animals belonging to the goblins whose ancestors had taken their ancestors many centuries before from the upper regions of light into the lower regions of darkness  the original stocks of these horrible creatures were very much the same as the animals now seen about farms and homes in the country with the exception of a few of them which had been wild creatures such as foxes and indeed wolves and small bears which the goblins from their proclivity towards the animal creation had caught when cubs and tamed  but in the course of time all had undergone even greater changes than had passed upon their owners  they had altered that is their descendants had altered into such creatures as i have not attempted to describe except in the vaguest manner the various parts of their bodies assuming in an apparently arbitrary and self-willed manner the most abnormal developments indeed so little did any distinct type predominate in some of the bewildering results that you could only have guessed at any known animal as the original and even then what likeness remained would be more one of general expression than of definable conformation  but what increased the gruesomeness tenfold was that from constant domestic or indeed rather family association with the goblins their countenances had grown in grotesque resemblance to the human  no one understands animals who does not see that every one of them even amongst the fishes it may be with a dimness and vagueness infinitely remote yet shadows the human  in the case of these the human resemblance had greatly increased  while their owners had sunk towards them they had risen towards their owners  but the conditions of subterranean life being equally unnatural for both while the goblins were worse the creatures had not improved by the approximation and its result would have appeared far more ludicrous than consoling to the warmest lover of animal nature  i shall now explain how it was that just then these animals began to show themselves about the king's country house  the goblins as curdie had discovered were mining on at work both day and night in divisions urging the scheme after which he lay in wait in the course of their tunnelling they had broken into the channel of a small stream but the break being in the top of it no water had escaped to interfere with their work  some of the creatures hovering as they often did about their masters had found the hole and had with the curiosity which had grown to a passion from the restraints of their unnatural circumstances proceeded to explore the channel  the stream was the same which ran out by the seat on which irene and her king-papa had sat as i have told and the goblin creatures found it jolly fun to get out for a romp on a smooth lawn such as they had never seen in all their poor miserable lives  but although they had partaken enough of the nature of their owners to delight in annoying and alarming any of the people whom they met on the mountain they were of course incapable of designs of their own or of intentionally furthering those of their masters  for several nights after the men-at-arms were at length of one mind as to the fact of the visits of some horrible creatures whether bodily or spectral they could not yet say they watched with special attention that part of the garden where they had last seen them  perhaps indeed they gave in consequence too little attention to the house  but the creatures were too cunning to be easily caught nor were the watchers quick-eyed enough to descry the head or the keen eyes in it which from the opening whence the stream issued would watch them in turn ready the moment they should leave the lawn to report the place clear    chapter 14  that night week  during the whole of the week irene had been thinking every other moment of her promise to the old lady although even now she could not feel quite sure that she had not been dreaming  could it really be that an old lady lived up in the top of the house with pigeons and a spinning-wheel and a lamp that never went out  she was however none the less determined on the coming friday to ascend the three stairs walk through the passages with the many doors and try to find the tower in which she had either seen or dreamed her grandmother  her nurse could not help wondering what had come to the child she would sit so thoughtfully silent and even in the midst of a game with her would so suddenly fall into a dreamy mood  but irene took care to betray nothing whatever efforts lootie might make to get at her thoughts  and lootie had to say to herself  'what an odd child she is' and give it up  at length the longed-for friday arrived and lest lootie should be moved to watch her irene endeavoured to keep herself as quiet as possible  in the afternoon she asked for her doll's house and went on arranging and rearranging the various rooms and their inhabitants for a whole hour  then she gave a sigh and threw herself back in her chair one of the dolls would not sit and another would not stand and they were all very tiresome  indeed there was one would not even lie down which was too bad  but it was now getting dark and the darker it got the more excited irene became and the more she felt it necessary to be composed  'i see you want your tea princess' said the nurse  'i will go and get it  the room feels close  i will open the window a little the evening is mild  it won't hurt you'  'there's no fear of that lootie' said irene wishing she had put off going for the tea till it was darker when she might have made her attempt with every advantage  i fancy lootie was longer in returning than she had intended for when irene who had been lost in thought looked up she saw it was nearly dark and at the same moment caught sight of a pair of eyes bright with a green light glowering at her through the open window  the next instant something leaped into the room  it was like a cat with legs as long as a horse's irene said but its body no bigger and its legs no thicker than those of a cat  she was too frightened to cry out but not too frightened to jump from her chair and run from the room  it is plain enough to every one of my readers what she ought to have done and indeed irene thought of it herself but when she came to the foot of the old stair just outside the nursery door she imagined the creature running up those long ascents after her and pursuing her through the dark passages which after all might lead to no tower that thought was too much  her heart failed her and turning from the stair she rushed along to the hall whence finding the front door open she darted into the court pursued at least she thought so by the creature  no one happening to see her on she ran unable to think for fear and ready to run anywhere to elude the awful creature with the stilt-legs  not daring to look behind her she rushed straight out of the gate and up the mountain  it was foolish indeed thus to run farther and farther from all who could help her as if she had been seeking a fit spot for the goblin creature to eat her in his leisure but that is the way fear serves us  it always sides with the thing we are afraid of  the princess was soon out of breath with running uphill but she ran on for she fancied the horrible creature just behind her forgetting that had it been after her such long legs as those must have overtaken her long ago  at last she could run no longer and fell unable even to scream by the roadside where she lay for some time half dead with terror  but finding nothing lay hold of her and her breath beginning to come back she ventured at length to get half up and peer anxiously about her  it was now so dark she could see nothing  not a single star was out  she could not even tell in what direction the house lay and between her and home she fancied the dreadful creature lying ready to pounce upon her she saw now that she ought to have run up the stairs at once  it was well she did not scream for although very few of the goblins had come out for weeks a stray idler or two might have heard her she sat down upon a stone and nobody but one who had done something wrong could have been more miserable  she had quite forgotten her promise to visit her grandmother  a raindrop fell on her face  she looked up and for a moment her terror was lost in astonishment  at first she thought the rising moon had left her place and drawn nigh to see what could be the matter with the little girl sitting alone without hat or cloak on the dark bare mountain but she soon saw she was mistaken for there was no light on the ground at her feet and no shadow anywhere  but a great silver globe was hanging in the air and as she gazed at the lovely thing her courage revived  if she were but indoors again she would fear nothing not even the terrible creature with the long legs  but how was she to find her way back  what could that light be  could it be  no it couldn't  but what if it should be yes it must be her great-great-grandmother's lamp which guided her pigeons home through the darkest night  she jumped up  she had but to keep that light in view and she must find the house  her heart grew strong  speedily yet softly she walked down the hill hoping to pass the watching creature unseen  dark as it was there was little danger now of choosing the wrong road  and which was most strange the light that filled her eyes from the lamp instead of blinding them for a moment to the object upon which they next fell enabled her for a moment to see it despite the darkness  by looking at the lamp and then dropping her eyes she could see the road for a yard or two in front of her and this saved her from several falls for the road was very rough  but all at once to her dismay it vanished and the terror of the beast which had left her the moment she began to return again laid hold of her heart  the same instant however she caught the light of the windows and knew exactly where she was  it was too dark to run but she made what haste she could and reached the gate in safety  she found the house door still open ran through the hall and without even looking into the nursery bounded straight up the stair and the next and the next then turning to the right ran through the long avenue of silent rooms and found her way at once to the door at the foot of the tower stair  when first the nurse missed her she fancied she was playing her a trick and for some time took no trouble about her but at last getting frightened she had begun to search and when the princess entered the whole household was hither and thither over the house hunting for her  a few seconds after she reached the stair of the tower they had even begun to search the neglected rooms in which they would never have thought of looking had they not already searched every other place they could think of in vain  but by this time she was knocking at the old lady's door    chapter 15  woven and then spun  'come in irene' said the silvery voice of her grandmother  the princess opened the door and peeped in  but the room was quite dark and there was no sound of the spinning-wheel  she grew frightened once more thinking that although the room was there the old lady might be a dream after all  every little girl knows how dreadful it is to find a room empty where she thought somebody was but irene had to fancy for a moment that the person she came to find was nowhere at all she remembered however that at night she spun only in the moonlight and concluded that must be why there was no sweet bee-like humming  the old lady might be somewhere in the darkness  before she had time to think another thought she heard her voice again saying as before  'come in irene'  from the sound she understood at once that she was not in the room beside her  perhaps she was in her bedroom  she turned across the passage feeling her way to the other door  when her hand fell on the lock again the old lady spoke   'shut the other door behind you irene  i always close the door of my workroom when i go to my chamber'  irene wondered to hear her voice so plainly through the door  having shut the other she opened it and went in  oh what a lovely haven to reach from the darkness and fear through which she had come  the soft light made her feel as if she were going into the heart of the milkiest pearl while the blue walls and their silver stars for a moment perplexed her with the fancy that they were in reality the sky which she had left outside a minute ago covered with rainclouds  'i've lighted a fire for you irene  you're cold and wet' said her grandmother  then irene looked again and saw that what she had taken for a huge bouquet of red roses on a low stand against the wall was in fact a fire which burned in the shapes of the loveliest and reddest roses glowing gorgeously between the heads and wings of two cherubs of shining silver  and when she came nearer she found that the smell of roses with which the room was filled came from the fire-roses on the hearth her grandmother was dressed in the loveliest pale blue velvet over which her hair no longer white but of a rich golden colour streamed like a cataract here falling in dull gathered heaps there rushing away in smooth shining falls  and ever as she looked the hair seemed pouring down from her head and vanishing in a golden mist ere it reached the floor  it flowed from under the edge of a circle of shining silver set with alternated pearls and opals  on her dress was no ornament whatever neither was there a ring on her hand or a necklace or carcanet about her neck  but her slippers glimmered with the light of the milky way for they were covered with seed-pearls and opals in one mass  her face was that of a woman of three-and-twenty  the princess was so bewildered with astonishment and admiration that she could hardly thank her and drew nigh with timidity feeling dirty and uncomfortable  the lady was seated on a low chair by the side of the fire with hands outstretched to take her but the princess hung back with a troubled smile  'why what's the matter' asked her grandmother  'you haven't been doing anything wrong i know that by your face though it is rather miserable  what's the matter my dear'  and she still held out her arms  'dear grandmother' said irene 'i'm not so sure that i haven't done something wrong  i ought to have run up to you at once when the long-legged cat came in at the window instead of running out on the mountain and making myself such a fright'  'you were taken by surprise my child and you are not so likely to do it again  it is when people do wrong things wilfully that they are the more likely to do them again  come'  and still she held out her arms  'but grandmother you're so beautiful and grand with your crown on and i am so dirty with mud and rain  i should quite spoil your beautiful blue dress'  with a merry little laugh the lady sprung from her chair more lightly far than irene herself could caught the child to her bosom and kissing the tear-stained face over and over sat down with her in her lap  'oh grandmother  you'll make yourself such a mess' cried irene clinging to her  'you darling do you think i care more for my dress than for my little girl  besides look here'  as she spoke she set her down and irene saw to her dismay that the lovely dress was covered with the mud of her fall on the mountain road but the lady stooped to the fire and taking from it by the stalk in her fingers one of the burning roses passed it once and again and a third time over the front of her dress and when irene looked not a single stain was to be discovered  'there' said her grandmother 'you won't mind coming to me now'  but irene again hung back eying the flaming rose which the lady held in her hand  'you're not afraid of the rose are you' she said about to throw it on the hearth again  'oh don't please' cried irene  'won't you hold it to my frock and my hands and my face  and i'm afraid my feet and my knees want it too'  'no answered her grandmother smiling a little sadly as she threw the rose from her 'it is too hot for you yet  it would set your frock in a flame  besides i don't want to make you clean tonight  i want your nurse and the rest of the people to see you as you are for you will have to tell them how you ran away for fear of the long-legged cat  i should like to wash you but they would not believe you then do you see that bath behind you'  the princess looked and saw a large oval tub of silver shining brilliantly in the light of the wonderful lamp  'go and look into it' said the lady  irene went and came back very silent with her eyes shining  'what did you see' asked her grandmother  'the sky and the moon and the stars' she answered  'it looked as if there was no bottom to it'  the lady smiled a pleased satisfied smile and was silent also for a few moments  then she said   'any time you want a bath come to me  i know you have a bath every morning but sometimes you want one at night too'  'thank you grandmother i will i will indeed' answered irene and was again silent for some moments thinking  then she said  'how was it grandmother that i saw your beautiful lamp not the light of it only but the great round silvery lamp itself hanging alone in the great open air high up  it was your lamp i saw wasn't it'  'yes my child it was my lamp'  'then how was it  i don't see a window all round'  'when i please i can make the lamp shine through the walls shine so strong that it melts them away from before the sight and shows itself as you saw it  but as i told you it is not everybody can see it'  'how is it that i can then  i'm sure i don't know'  'it is a gift born with you  and one day i hope everybody will have it'  'but how do you make it shine through the walls'  'ah that you would not understand if i were to try ever so much to make you not yet not yet  but' added the lady rising 'you must sit in my chair while i get you the present i have been preparing for you  i told you my spinning was for you  it is finished now and i am going to fetch it  i have been keeping it warm under one of my brooding pigeons'  irene sat down in the low chair and her grandmother left her shutting the door behind her  the child sat gazing now at the rose fire now at the starry walls now at the silver light and a great quietness grew in her heart  if all the long-legged cats in the world had come rushing at her then she would not have been afraid of them for a moment  how this was she could not tell she only knew there was no fear in her and everything was so right and safe that it could not get in  she had been gazing at the lovely lamp for some minutes fixedly  turning her eyes she found the wall had vanished for she was looking out on the dark cloudy night  but though she heard the wind blowing none of it blew upon her  in a moment more the clouds themselves parted or rather vanished like the wall and she looked straight into the starry herds flashing gloriously in the dark blue  it was but for a moment  the clouds gathered again and shut out the stars the wall gathered again and shut out the clouds and there stood the lady beside her with the loveliest smile on her face and a shimmering ball in her hand about the size of a pigeon's egg  'there irene there is my work for you' she said holding out the ball to the princess  she took it in her hand and looked at it all over  it sparkled a little and shone here and there but not much  it was of a sort of grey-whiteness something like spun glass  'is this all your spinning grandmother' she asked  'all since you came to the house  there is more there than you think'  'how pretty it is  what am i to do with it please'  'that i will now explain to you' answered the lady turning from her and going to her cabinet  she came back with a small ring in her hand then she took the ball from irene's and did something with the ring irene could not tell what  'give me your hand' she said  irene held up her right hand  'yes that is the hand i want' said the lady and put the ring on the forefinger of it  'what a beautiful ring' said irene  'what is the stone called'  'it is a fire-opal' 'please am i to keep it'  'always' 'oh thank you grandmother  it's prettier than anything i ever saw except those of all colours-in your please is that your crown'  'yes it is my crown  the stone in your ring is of the same sort only not so good  it has only red but mine have all colours you see'  'yes grandmother  i will take such care of it  but ' she added hesitating  'but what' asked her grandmother  'what am i to say when lootie asks me where i got it'  'you will ask her where you got it' answered the lady smiling  'i don't see how i can do that'  'you will though'  'of course i will if you say so  but you know i can't pretend not to know'  'of course not  but don't trouble yourself about it  you will see when the time comes'  so saying the lady turned and threw the little ball into the rose fire  'oh grandmother' exclaimed irene 'i thought you had spun it for me'  'so i did my child  and you've got it'  'no it's burnt in the fire'  the lady put her hand in the fire brought out the ball glimmering as before and held it towards her  irene stretched out her hand to take it but the lady turned and going to her cabinet opened a drawer and laid the ball in it  'have i done anything to vex you grandmother' said irene pitifully  'no my darling  but you must understand that no one ever gives anything to another properly and really without keeping it  that ball is yours'  'oh i'm not to take it with me  you are going to keep it for me'  'you are to take it with you  i've fastened the end of it to the ring on your finger'  irene looked at the ring  'i can't see it there grandmother' she said  'feel a little way from the ring towards the cabinet' said the lady  'oh i do feel it' exclaimed the princess  'but i can't see it' she added looking close to her outstretched hand  'no  the thread is too fine for you to see it  you can only feel it now you can fancy how much spinning that took although it does seem such a little ball'  'but what use can i make of it if it lies in your cabinet'  'that is what i will explain to you  it would be of no use to you it wouldn't be yours at all if it did not lie in my cabinet  now listen if ever you find yourself in any danger such for example as you were in this same evening you must take off your ring and put it under the pillow of your bed  then you must lay your finger the same that wore the ring upon the thread and follow the thread wherever it leads you'  'oh how delightful  it will lead me to you grandmother i know'  'yes  but remember it may seem to you a very roundabout way indeed and you must not doubt the thread  of one thing you may be sure that while you hold it i hold it too'  'it is very wonderful' said irene thoughtfully  then suddenly becoming aware she jumped up crying   'oh grandmother here have i been sitting all this time in your chair and you standing  i beg your pardon'  the lady laid her hand on her shoulder and said   'sit down again irene  nothing pleases me better than to see anyone sit in my chair  i am only too glad to stand so long as anyone will sit in it'  'how kind of you' said the princess and sat down again  'it makes me happy' said the lady  'but' said irene still puzzled 'won't the thread get in somebody's way and be broken if the one end is fast to my ring and the other laid in your cabinet'  'you will find all that arrange itself  i am afraid it is time for you to go'  'mightn't i stay and sleep with you tonight grandmother' 'no not tonight  if i had meant you to stay tonight i should have given you a bath but you know everybody in the house is miserable about you and it would be cruel to keep them so all night  you must go downstairs'  'i'm so glad grandmother you didn't say go home for this is my home  mayn't i call this my home'  'you may my child  and i trust you will always think it your home now come  i must take you back without anyone seeing you'  'please i want to ask you one question more' said irene  'is it because you have your crown on that you look so young'  'no child' answered her grandmother 'it is because i felt so young this evening that i put my crown on  and i thought you would like to see your old grandmother in her best'  'why do you call yourself old  you're not old grandmother'  'i am very old indeed  it is so silly of people i don't mean you for you are such a tiny and couldn't know better but it is so silly of people to fancy that old age means crookedness and witheredness and feebleness and sticks and spectacles and rheumatism and forgetfulness it is so silly old age has nothing whatever to do with all that  the right old age means strength and beauty and mirth and courage and clear eyes and strong painless limbs  i am older than you are able to think and '  'and look at you grandmother' cried irene jumping up and flinging her arms about her neck  'i won't be so silly again i promise you at least i'm rather afraid to promise but if i am i promise to be sorry for it i do  i wish i were as old as you grandmother  i don't think you are ever afraid of anything'  'not for long at least my child  perhaps by the time i am two thousand years of age i shall indeed never be afraid of anything but i confess i have sometimes been afraid about my children sometimes about you irene'  'oh i'm so sorry grandmother  tonight i suppose you mean'  'yes a little tonight but a good deal when you had all but made up your mind that i was a dream and no real great-great-grandmother  you must not suppose i am blaming you for that  i dare say you could not help it'  'i don't know grandmother' said the princess beginning to cry 'i can't always do myself as i should like  and i don't always try  i'm very sorry anyhow'  the lady stooped lifted her in her arms and sat down with her in her chair holding her close to her bosom  in a few minutes the princess had sobbed herself to sleep  how long she slept i do not know  when she came to herself she was sitting in her own high chair at the nursery table with her doll's house before her    chapter 16  the ring  the same moment her nurse came into the room sobbing  when she saw her sitting there she started back with a loud cry of amazement and joy  then running to her she caught her in her arms and covered her with kisses  'my precious darling princess where have you been  what has happened to you  we've all been crying our eyes out and searching the house from top to bottom for you'  'not quite from the top' thought irene to herself and she might have added 'not quite to the bottom' perhaps if she had known all  but the one she would not and the other she could not say 'oh lootie i've had such a dreadful adventure' she replied and told her all about the cat with the long legs and how she ran out upon the mountain and came back again  but she said nothing of her grandmother or her lamp  'and there we've been searching for you all over the house for more than an hour and a half' exclaimed the nurse  'but that's no matter now we've got you  only princess i must say' she added her mood changing 'what you ought to have done was to call for your own lootie to come and help you instead of running out of the house and up the mountain in that wild i must say foolish fashion'  'well lootie' said irene quietly 'perhaps if you had a big cat all legs running at you you might not exactly know what was the wisest thing to do at the moment'  'i wouldn't run up the mountain anyhow' returned lootie  'not if you had time to think about it  but when those creatures came at you that night on the mountain you were so frightened yourself that you lost your way home'  this put a stop to lootie's reproaches  she had been on the point of saying that the long-legged cat must have been a twilight fancy of the princess's but the memory of the horrors of that night and of the talking-to which the king had given her in consequence prevented her from saying what after all she did not half believe having a strong suspicion that the cat was a goblin for she knew nothing of the difference between the goblins and their creatures  she counted them all just goblins  without another word she went and got some fresh tea and bread and butter for the princess  before she returned the whole household headed by the housekeeper burst into the nursery to exult over their darling  the gentlemen-at-arms followed and were ready enough to believe all she told them about the long-legged cat indeed though wise enough to say nothing about it they remembered with no little horror just such a creature amongst those they had surprised at their gambols upon the princess's lawn  in their own hearts they blamed themselves for not having kept better watch  and their captain gave orders that from this night the front door and all the windows on the ground floor should be locked immediately the sun set and opened after upon no pretence whatever the men-at-arms redoubled their vigilance and for some time there was no further cause of alarm  when the princess woke the next morning her nurse was bending over her  'how your ring does glow this morning princess just like a fiery rose' she said  'does it lootie' returned irene  'who gave me the ring lootie i know i've had it a long time but where did i get it  i don't remember'  'i think it must have been your mother gave it you princess but really for as long as you have worn it i don't remember that ever i heard' answered her nurse  'i will ask my king-papa the next time he comes' said irene    chapter 17  springtime  the spring so dear to all creatures young and old came at last and before the first few days of it had gone the king rode through its budding valleys to see his little daughter  he had been in a distant part of his dominions all the winter for he was not in the habit of stopping in one great city or of visiting only his favourite country houses but he moved from place to place that all his people might know him  wherever he journeyed he kept a constant look-out for the ablest and best men to put into office and wherever he found himself mistaken and those he had appointed incapable or unjust he removed them at once  hence you see it was his care of the people that kept him from seeing his princess so often as he would have liked  you may wonder why he did not take her about with him but there were several reasons against his doing so and i suspect her great-great-grandmother had had a principal hand in preventing it  once more irene heard the bugle-blast and once more she was at the gate to meet her father as he rode up on his great white horse  after they had been alone for a little while she thought of what she had resolved to ask him  'please king-papa' she said 'will you tell me where i got this pretty ring  i can't remember'  the king looked at it  a strange beautiful smile spread like sunshine over his face and an answering smile but at the same time a questioning one spread like moonlight over irene's  'it was your queen-mamma's once' he said  'and why isn't it hers now' asked irene  'she does not want it now' said the king looking grave  'why doesn't she want it now'  'because she's gone where all those rings are made'  'and when shall i see her' asked the princess  'not for some time yet' answered the king and the tears came into his eyes  irene did not remember her mother and did not know why her father looked so and why the tears came in his eyes but she put her arms round his neck and kissed him and asked no more questions  the king was much disturbed on hearing the report of the gentlemen-at-arms concerning the creatures they had seen and i presume would have taken irene with him that very day but for what the presence of the ring on her finger assured him of  about an hour before he left irene saw him go up the old stair and he did not come down again till they were just ready to start and she thought with herself that he had been up to see the old lady  when he went away he left other six gentlemen behind him that there might be six of them always on guard  and now in the lovely spring weather irene was out on the mountain the greater part of the day  in the warmer hollows there were lovely primroses and not so many that she ever got tired of them  as often as she saw a new one opening an eye of light in the blind earth she would clap her hands with gladness and unlike some children i know instead of pulling it would touch it as tenderly as if it had been a new baby and having made its acquaintance would leave it as happy as she found it  she treated the plants on which they grew like birds' nests every fresh flower was like a new little bird to her  she would pay visits to all the flower-nests she knew remembering each by itself  she would go down on her hands and knees beside one and say  'good morning  are you all smelling very sweet this morning good-bye' and then she would go to another nest and say the same  it was a favourite amusement with her  there were many flowers up and down and she loved them all but the primroses were her favourites  'they're not too shy and they're not a bit forward' she would say to lootie  there were goats too about over the mountain and when the little kids came she was as pleased with them as with the flowers  the goats belonged to the miners mostly-a few of them to curdie's mother but there were a good many wild ones that seemed to belong to nobody these the goblins counted theirs and it was upon them partly that they lived  they set snares and dug pits for them and did not scruple to take what tame ones happened to be caught but they did not try to steal them in any other manner because they were afraid of the dogs the hill-people kept to watch them for the knowing dogs always tried to bite their feet  but the goblins had a kind of sheep of their own very queer creatures which they drove out to feed at night and the other goblin creatures were wise enough to keep good watch over them for they knew they should have their bones by and by    chapter 18  curdie's clue  curdie was as watchful as ever but was almost getting tired of his ill success  every other night or so he followed the goblins about as they went on digging and boring and getting as near them as he could watched them from behind stones and rocks but as yet he seemed no nearer finding out what they had in view  as at first he always kept hold of the end of his string while his pickaxe left just outside the hole by which he entered the goblins' country from the mine continued to serve as an anchor and hold fast the other end  the goblins hearing no more noise in that quarter had ceased to apprehend an immediate invasion and kept no watch  one night after dodging about and listening till he was nearly falling asleep with weariness he began to roll up his ball for he had resolved to go home to bed  it was not long however before he began to feel bewildered  one after another he passed goblin houses caves that is occupied by goblin families and at length was sure they were many more than he had passed as he came  he had to use great caution to pass unseen they lay so close together could his string have led him wrong  he still followed winding it and still it led him into more thickly populated quarters until he became quite uneasy and indeed apprehensive for although he was not afraid of the cobs he was afraid of not finding his way out but what could he do  it was of no use to sit down and wait for the morning the morning made no difference here  it was dark and always dark and if his string failed him he was helpless  he might even arrive within a yard of the mine and never know it seeing he could do nothing better he would at least find where the end of his string was and if possible how it had come to play him such a trick  he knew by the size of the ball that he was getting pretty near the last of it when he began to feel a tugging and pulling at it  what could it mean  turning a sharp corner he thought he heard strange sounds  these grew as he went on to a scuffling and growling and squeaking and the noise increased until turning a second sharp corner he found himself in the midst of it and the same moment tumbled over a wallowing mass which he knew must be a knot of the cobs' creatures  before he could recover his feet he had caught some great scratches on his face and several severe bites on his legs and arms  but as he scrambled to get up his hand fell upon his pickaxe and before the horrid beasts could do him any serious harm he was laying about with it right and left in the dark the hideous cries which followed gave him the satisfaction of knowing that he had punished some of them pretty smartly for their rudeness and by their scampering and their retreating howls he perceived that he had routed them  he stood for a little weighing his battle-axe in his hand as if it had been the most precious lump of metal but indeed no lump of gold itself could have been so precious at the time as that common tool then untied the end of the string from it put the ball in his pocket and still stood thinking  it was clear that the cobs' creatures had found his axe had between them carried it off and had so led him he knew not where  but for all his thinking he could not tell what he ought to do until suddenly he became aware of a glimmer of light in the distance  without a moment's hesitation he set out for it as fast as the unknown and rugged way would permit  yet again turning a corner led by the dim light he spied something quite new in his experience of the underground regions a small irregular shape of something shining  going up to it he found it was a piece of mica or muscovy glass called sheep-silver in scotland and the light flickered as if from a fire behind it  after trying in vain for some time to discover an entrance to the place where it was burning he came at length to a small chamber in which an opening high in the wall revealed a glow beyond  to this opening he managed to scramble up and then he saw a strange sight  below sat a little group of goblins around a fire the smoke of which vanished in the darkness far aloft  the sides of the cave were full of shining minerals like those of the palace hall and the company was evidently of a superior order for every one wore stones about head or arms or waist shining dull gorgeous colours in the light of the fire nor had curdie looked long before he recognized the king himself and found that he had made his way into the inner apartment of the royal family  he had never had such a good chance of hearing something  he crept through the hole as softly as he could scrambled a good way down the wall towards them without attracting attention and then sat down and listened the king evidently the queen and probably the crown prince and the prime minister were talking together  he was sure of the queen by her shoes for as she warmed her feet at the fire he saw them quite plainly  'that will be fun' said the one he took for the crown prince it was the first whole sentence he heard  'i don't see why you should think it such a grand affair' said his stepmother tossing her head backward  'you must remember my spouse' interposed his majesty as if making excuse for his son 'he has got the same blood in him  his mother '  'don't talk to me of his mother  you positively encourage his unnatural fancies  whatever belongs to that mother ought to be cut out of him'  'you forget yourself my dear' said the king  'i don't' said the queen 'nor you either  if you expect me to approve of such coarse tastes you will find yourself mistaken  i don't wear shoes for nothing'  'you must acknowledge however' the king said with a little groan 'that this at least is no whim of harelip's but a matter of state policy  you are well aware that his gratification comes purely from the pleasure of sacrificing himself to the public good  does it not harelip'  'yes father of course it does  only it will be nice to make her cry i'll have the skin taken off between her toes and tie them up till they grow together  then her feet will be like other people's and there will be no occasion for her to wear shoes'  'do you mean to insinuate i've got toes you unnatural wretch' cried the queen and she moved angrily towards harelip  the councillor however who was betwixt them leaned forward so as to prevent her touching him but only as if to address the prince  'your royal highness' he said 'possibly requires to be reminded that you have got three toes yourself one on one foot two on the other'  'ha ha ha' shouted the queen triumphantly  the councillor encouraged by this mark of favour went on  'it seems to me your royal highness it would greatly endear you to your future people proving to them that you are not the less one of themselves that you had the misfortune to be born of a sun-mother if you were to command upon yourself the comparatively slight operation which in a more extended form you so wisely meditate with regard to your future princess'  'ha ha ha' laughed the queen louder than before and the king and the minister joined in the laugh  harelip growled and for a few moments the others continued to express their enjoyment of his discomfiture  the queen was the only one curdie could see with any distinctness she sat sideways to him and the light of the fire shone full upon her face  he could not consider her handsome  her nose was certainly broader at the end than its extreme length and her eyes instead of being horizontal were set up like two perpendicular eggs one on the broad the other on the small end  her mouth was no bigger than a small buttonhole until she laughed when it stretched from ear to ear only to be sure her ears were very nearly in the middle of her cheeks  anxious to hear everything they might say curdie ventured to slide down a smooth part of the rock just under him to a projection below upon which he thought to rest  but whether he was not careful enough or the projection gave way down he came with a rush on the floor of the cavern bringing with him a great rumbling shower of stones  the goblins jumped from their seats in more anger than consternation for they had never yet seen anything to be afraid of in the palace but when they saw curdie with his pick in his hand their rage was mingled with fear for they took him for the first of an invasion of miners  the king notwithstanding drew himself up to his full height of four feet spread himself to his full breadth of three and a half for he was the handsomest and squarest of all the goblins and strutting up to curdie planted himself with outspread feet before him and said with dignity   'pray what right have you in my palace'  'the right of necessity your majesty' answered curdie  'i lost my way and did not know where i was wandering to'  'how did you get in'  'by a hole in the mountain'  'but you are a miner  look at your pickaxe'  curdie did look at it answering   'i came upon it lying on the ground a little way from here  i tumbled over some wild beasts who were playing with it  look your majesty' and curdie showed him how he was scratched and bitten  the king was pleased to find him behave more politely than he had expected from what his people had told him concerning the miners for he attributed it to the power of his own presence but he did not therefore feel friendly to the intruder  'you will oblige me by walking out of my dominions at once' he said well knowing what a mockery lay in the words  'with pleasure if your majesty will give me a guide' said curdie  'i will give you a thousand' said the king with a scoffing air of magnificent liberality  'one will be quite sufficient' said curdie  but the king uttered a strange shout half halloo half roar and in rushed goblins till the cave was swarming  he said something to the first of them which curdie could not hear and it was passed from one to another till in a moment the farthest in the crowd had evidently heard and understood it  they began to gather about him in a way he did not relish and he retreated towards the wall they pressed upon him  'stand back' said curdie grasping his pickaxe tighter by his knee  they only grinned and pressed closer  curdie bethought himself and began to rhyme     'ten twenty thirty    you're all so very dirty   twenty thirty forty    you're all so thick and snorty   'thirty forty fifty    you're all so puff-and-snifty   forty fifty sixty    beast and man so mixty    'fifty sixty seventy    mixty maxty leaventy   sixty seventy eighty    all your cheeks so slaty    'seventy eighty ninety   all your hands so flinty   eighty ninety hundred   altogether dundred'   the goblins fell back a little when he began and made horrible grimaces all through the rhyme as if eating something so disagreeable that it set their teeth on edge and gave them the creeps but whether it was that the rhyming words were most of them no words at all for a new rhyme being considered the more efficacious curdie had made it on the spur of the moment or whether it was that the presence of the king and queen gave them courage i cannot tell but the moment the rhyme was over they crowded on him again and out shot a hundred long arms with a multitude of thick nailless fingers at the ends of them to lay hold upon him  then curdie heaved up his axe  but being as gentle as courageous and not wishing to kill any of them he turned the end which was square and blunt like a hammer and with that came down a great blow on the head of the goblin nearest him  hard as the heads of all goblins are he thought he must feel that  and so he did no doubt but he only gave a horrible cry and sprung at curdie's throat curdie however drew back in time and just at that critical moment remembered the vulnerable part of the goblin body  he made a sudden rush at the king and stamped with all his might on his majesty's feet the king gave a most unkingly howl and almost fell into the fire curdie then rushed into the crowd stamping right and left  the goblins drew back howling on every side as he approached but they were so crowded that few of those he attacked could escape his tread and the shrieking and roaring that filled the cave would have appalled curdie but for the good hope it gave him  they were tumbling over each other in heaps in their eagerness to rush from the cave when a new assailant suddenly faced him the queen with flaming eyes and expanded nostrils her hair standing half up from her head rushed at him she trusted in her shoes  they were of granite hollowed like french sabots  curdie would have endured much rather than hurt a woman even if she was a goblin but here was an affair of life and death  forgetting her shoes he made a great stamp on one of her feet  but she instantly returned it with very different effect causing him frightful pain and almost disabling him  his only chance with her would have been to attack the granite shoes with his pickaxe but before he could think of that she had caught him up in her arms and was rushing with him across the cave  she dashed him into a hole in the wall with a force that almost stunned him  but although he could not move he was not too far gone to hear her great cry and the rush of multitudes of soft feet followed by the sounds of something heaved up against the rock after which came a multitudinous patter of stones falling near him  the last had not ceased when he grew very faint for his head had been badly cut and at last insensible  when he came to himself there was perfect silence about him and utter darkness but for the merest glimmer in one tiny spot  he crawled to it and found that they had heaved a slab against the mouth of the hole past the edge of which a poor little gleam found its way from the fire  he could not move it a hairbreadth for they had piled a great heap of stones against it  he crawled back to where he had been lying in the faint hope of finding his pickaxe but after a vain search he was at last compelled to acknowledge himself in an evil plight  he sat down and tried to think but soon fell fast asleep    chapter 19  goblin counsels  he must have slept a long time for when he awoke he felt wonderfully restored indeed almost well and very hungry  there were voices in the outer cave  once more then it was night for the goblins slept during the day and went about their affairs during the night  in the universal and constant darkness of their dwelling they had no reason to prefer the one arrangement to the other but from aversion to the sun-people they chose to be busy when there was least chance of their being met either by the miners below when they were burrowing or by the people of the mountain above when they were feeding their sheep or catching their goats  and indeed it was only when the sun was away that the outside of the mountain was sufficiently like their own dismal regions to be endurable to their mole eyes so thoroughly had they become unaccustomed to any light beyond that of their own fires and torches  curdie listened and soon found that they were talking of himself  'how long will it take' asked harelip  'not many days i should think' answered the king  'they are poor feeble creatures those sun-people and want to be always eating we can go a week at a time without food and be all the better for it but i've been told they eat two or three times every day  can you believe it  they must be quite hollow inside not at all like us nine-tenths of whose bulk is solid flesh and bone  yes i judge a week of starvation will do for him'  'if i may be allowed a word' interposed the queen 'and i think i ought to have some voice in the matter '  'the wretch is entirely at your disposal my spouse' interrupted the king  'he is your property  you caught him yourself  we should never have done it'  the queen laughed  she seemed in far better humour than the night before  'i was about to say' she resumed 'that it does seem a pity to waste so much fresh meat'  'what are you thinking of my love' said the king  'the very notion of starving him implies that we are not going to give him any meat either salt or fresh'  'i'm not such a stupid as that comes to' returned her majesty 'what i mean is that by the time he is starved there will hardly be a picking upon his bones'  the king gave a great laugh  'well my spouse you may have him when you like' he said  'i don't fancy him for my part  i am pretty sure he is tough eating'  'that would be to honour instead of punish his insolence' returned the queen  'but why should our poor creatures be deprived of so much nourishment  our little dogs and cats and pigs and small bears would enjoy him very much'  'you are the best of housekeepers my lovely queen' said her husband 'let it be so by all means  let us have our people in and get him out and kill him at once  he deserves it  the mischief he might have brought upon us now that he had penetrated so far as our most retired citadel is incalculable  or rather let us tie him hand and foot and have the pleasure of seeing him torn to pieces by full torchlight in the great hall'  'better and better' cried the queen and the prince together both of them clapping their hands  and the prince made an ugly noise with his hare-lip just as if he had intended to be one at the feast  'but' added the queen bethinking herself 'he is so troublesome for poor creatures as they are there is something about those sun-people that is very troublesome  i cannot imagine how it is that with such superior strength and skill and understanding as ours we permit them to exist at all  why do we not destroy them entirely and use their cattle and grazing lands at our pleasure of course we don't want to live in their horrid country  it is far too glaring for our quieter and more refined tastes  but we might use it as a sort of outhouse you know  even our creatures' eyes might get used to it and if they did grow blind that would be of no consequence provided they grew fat as well  but we might even keep their great cows and other creatures and then we should have a few more luxuries such as cream and cheese which at present we only taste occasionally when our brave men have succeeded in carrying some off from their farms'  'it is worth thinking of' said the king 'and i don't know why you should be the first to suggest it except that you have a positive genius for conquest  but still as you say there is something very troublesome about them and it would be better as i understand you to suggest that we should starve him for a day or two first so that he may be a little less frisky when we take him out'     'once there was a goblin   living in a hole   busy he was cobblin'   a shoe without a sole    'by came a birdie    goblin what do you do   cobble at a sturdie   upper leather shoe    'what's the good o' that sir   said the little bird   why it's very pat sir    plain without a word    'where 'tis all a hole sir   never can be holes    why should their shoes have soles sir   when they've got no souls'   'what's that horrible noise' cried the queen shuddering from pot-metal head to granite shoes  'i declare' said the king with solemn indignation 'it's the sun-creature in the hole'  'stop that disgusting noise' cried the crown prince valiantly getting up and standing in front of the heap of stones with his face towards curdie's prison  'do now or i'll break your head'  'break away' shouted curdie and began singing again      'once there was a goblin   living in a hole '   'i really cannot bear it' said the queen  'if i could only get at his horrid toes with my slippers again'  'i think we had better go to bed' said the king  'it's not time to go to bed' said the queen  'i would if i was you' said curdie  'impertinent wretch' said the queen with the utmost scorn in her voice  'an impossible if' said his majesty with dignity  'quite' returned curdie and began singing again      'go to bed   goblin do   help the queen   take off her shoe    'if you do   it will disclose   a horrid set   of sprouting toes'   'what a lie' roared the queen in a rage  'by the way that reminds me' said the king 'that for as long as we have been married i have never seen your feet queen  i think you might take off your shoes when you go to bed  they positively hurt me sometimes'  'i will do as i like' retorted the queen sulkily  'you ought to do as your own hubby wishes you' said the king  'i will not' said the queen  'then i insist upon it' said the king  apparently his majesty approached the queen for the purpose of following the advice given by curdie for the latter heard a scuffle and then a great roar from the king  'will you be quiet then' said the queen wickedly  'yes yes queen  i only meant to coax you'  'hands off' cried the queen triumphantly  'i'm going to bed  you may come when you like  but as long as i am queen i will sleep in my shoes  it is my royal privilege  harelip go to bed'  'i'm going' said harelip sleepily  'so am i' said the king  'come along then' said the queen 'and mind you are good or i'll '  'oh no no no' screamed the king in the most supplicating of tones  curdie heard only a muttered reply in the distance and then the cave was quite still  they had left the fire burning and the light came through brighter than before  curdie thought it was time to try again if anything could be done  but he found he could not get even a finger through the chink between the slab and the rock  he gave a great rush with his shoulder against the slab but it yielded no more than if it had been part of the rock  all he could do was to sit down and think again  by and by he came to the resolution to pretend to be dying in the hope they might take him out before his strength was too much exhausted to let him have a chance  then for the creatures if he could but find his axe again he would have no fear of them and if it were not for the queen's horrid shoes he would have no fear at all  meantime until they should come again at night there was nothing for him to do but forge new rhymes now his only weapons  he had no intention of using them at present of course but it was well to have a stock for he might live to want them and the manufacture of them would help to while away the time    chapter 20  irene's clue  that same morning early the princess woke in a terrible fright there was a hideous noise in her room creatures snarling and hissing and rocketing about as if they were fighting  the moment she came to herself she remembered something she had never thought of again what her grandmother told her to do when she was frightened  she immediately took off her ring and put it under her pillow  as she did so she fancied she felt a finger and thumb take it gently from under her palm  'it must be my grandmother' she said to herself and the thought gave her such courage that she stopped to put on her dainty little slippers before running from the room  while doing this she caught sight of a long cloak of sky-blue thrown over the back of a chair by the bedside  she had never seen it before but it was evidently waiting for her  she put it on and then feeling with the forefinger of her right hand soon found her grandmother's thread which she proceeded at once to follow expecting it would lead her straight up the old stair when she reached the door she found it went down and ran along the floor so that she had almost to crawl in order to keep a hold of it  then to her surprise and somewhat to her dismay she found that instead of leading her towards the stair it turned in quite the opposite direction  it led her through certain narrow passages towards the kitchen turning aside ere she reached it and guiding her to a door which communicated with a small back yard some of the maids were already up and this door was standing open across the yard the thread still ran along the ground until it brought her to a door in the wall which opened upon the mountainside  when she had passed through the thread rose to about half her height and she could hold it with ease as she walked  it led her straight up the mountain  the cause of her alarm was less frightful than she supposed  the cook's great black cat pursued by the housekeeper's terrier had bounced against her bedroom door which had not been properly fastened and the two had burst into the room together and commenced a battle royal  how the nurse came to sleep through it was a mystery but i suspect the old lady had something to do with it  it was a clear warm morning  the wind blew deliciously over the mountainside  here and there she saw a late primrose but she did not stop to call upon them  the sky was mottled with small clouds  the sun was not yet up but some of their fluffy edges had caught his light and hung out orange and gold-coloured fringes upon the air  the dew lay in round drops upon the leaves and hung like tiny diamond ear-rings from the blades of grass about her path  'how lovely that bit of gossamer is' thought the princess looking at a long undulating line that shone at some distance from her up the hill  it was not the time for gossamers though and irene soon discovered that it was her own thread she saw shining on before her in the light of the morning  it was leading her she knew not whither but she had never in her life been out before sunrise and everything was so fresh and cool and lively and full of something coming that she felt too happy to be afraid of anything  after leading her up a good distance the thread turned to the left and down the path upon which she and lootie had met curdie but she never thought of that for now in the morning light with its far outlook over the country no path could have been more open and airy and cheerful  she could see the road almost to the horizon along which she had so often watched her king-papa and his troop come shining with the bugle-blast cleaving the air before them and it was like a companion to her  down and down the path went then up and then down and then up again getting rugged and more rugged as it went and still along the path went the silvery thread and still along the thread went irene's little rosy-tipped forefinger  by and by she came to a little stream that jabbered and prattled down the hill and up the side of the stream went both path and thread  and still the path grew rougher and steeper and the mountain grew wilder till irene began to think she was going a very long way from home and when she turned to look back she saw that the level country had vanished and the rough bare mountain had closed in about her  but still on went the thread and on went the princess  everything around her was getting brighter and brighter as the sun came nearer till at length his first rays all at once alighted on the top of a rock before her like some golden creature fresh from the sky  then she saw that the little stream ran out of a hole in that rock that the path did not go past the rock and that the thread was leading her straight up to it  a shudder ran through her from head to foot when she found that the thread was actually taking her into the hole out of which the stream ran  it ran out babbling joyously but she had to go in  she did not hesitate  right into the hole she went which was high enough to let her walk without stooping  for a little way there was a brown glimmer but at the first turn it all but ceased and before she had gone many paces she was in total darkness  then she began to be frightened indeed  every moment she kept feeling the thread backwards and forwards and as she went farther and farther into the darkness of the great hollow mountain she kept thinking more and more about her grandmother and all that she had said to her and how kind she had been and how beautiful she was and all about her lovely room and the fire of roses and the great lamp that sent its light through stone walls  and she became more and more sure that the thread could not have gone there of itself and that her grandmother must have sent it but it tried her dreadfully when the path went down very steep and especially when she came to places where she had to go down rough stairs and even sometimes a ladder  through one narrow passage after another over lumps of rock and sand and clay the thread guided her until she came to a small hole through which she had to creep  finding no change on the other side 'shall i ever get back' she thought over and over again wondering at herself that she was not ten times more frightened and often feeling as if she were only walking in the story of a dream  sometimes she heard the noise of water a dull gurgling inside the rock  by and by she heard the sounds of blows which came nearer and nearer but again they grew duller and almost died away in a hundred directions she turned obedient to the guiding thread  at last she spied a dull red shine and came up to the mica window and thence away and round about and right into a cavern where glowed the red embers of a fire  here the thread began to rise it rose as high as her head and higher still  what should she do if she lost her hold she was pulling it down  she might break it she could see it far up glowing as red as her fire-opal in the light of the embers  but presently she came to a huge heap of stones piled in a slope against the wall of the cavern  on these she climbed and soon recovered the level of the thread only however to find the next moment that it vanished through the heap of stones and left her standing on it with her face to the solid rock  for one terrible moment she felt as if her grandmother had forsaken her  the thread which the spiders had spun far over the seas which her grandmother had sat in the moonlight and spun again for her which she had tempered in the rose-fire and tied to her opal ring had left her had gone where she could no longer follow it had brought her into a horrible cavern and there left her  she was forsaken indeed  'when shall i wake' she said to herself in an agony but the same moment knew that it was no dream  she threw herself upon the heap and began to cry  it was well she did not know what creatures one of them with stone shoes on her feet were lying in the next cave but neither did she know who was on the other side of the slab  at length the thought struck her that at least she could follow the thread backwards and thus get out of the mountain and home  she rose at once and found the thread  but the instant she tried to feel it backwards it vanished from her touch  forwards it led her hand up to the heap of stones backwards it seemed nowhere neither could she see it as before in the light of the fire  she burst into a wailing cry and again threw herself down on the stones    chapter 21  the escape  as the princess lay and sobbed she kept feeling the thread mechanically following it with her finger many times up to the stones in which it disappeared  by and by she began still mechanically to poke her finger in after it between the stones as far as she could all at once it came into her head that she might remove some of the stones and see where the thread went next almost laughing at herself for never having thought of this before she jumped to her feet  her fear vanished once more she was certain her grandmother's thread could not have brought her there just to leave her there and she began to throw away the stones from the top as fast as she could sometimes two or three at a handful sometimes taking both hands to lift one  after clearing them away a little she found that the thread turned and went straight downwards  hence as the heap sloped a good deal growing of course wider towards its base she had to throw away a multitude of stones to follow the thread  but this was not all for she soon found that the thread after going straight down for a little way turned first sideways in one direction then sideways in another and then shot at various angles hither and thither inside the heap so that she began to be afraid that to clear the thread she must remove the whole huge gathering  she was dismayed at the very idea but losing no time set to work with a will and with aching back and bleeding fingers and hands she worked on sustained by the pleasure of seeing the heap slowly diminish and begin to show itself on the opposite side of the fire  another thing which helped to keep up her courage was that as often as she uncovered a turn of the thread instead of lying loose upon the stone it tightened up this made her sure that her grandmother was at the end of it somewhere  she had got about half-way down when she started and nearly fell with fright  close to her ears as it seemed a voice broke out singing     'jabber bother smash   you'll have it all in a crash   jabber smash bother   you'll have the worst of the pother   smash bother jabber '   here curdie stopped either because he could not find a rhyme to 'jabber' or because he remembered what he had forgotten when he woke up at the sound of irene's labours that his plan was to make the goblins think he was getting weak  but he had uttered enough to let irene know who he was  'it's curdie' she cried joyfully  'hush hush' came curdie's voice again from somewhere  'speak softly'  'why you were singing loud' said irene  'yes  but they know i am here and they don't know you are  who are you'  'i'm irene' answered the princess  'i know who you are quite well you're curdie'  'why how ever did you come here irene'  'my great-great-grandmother sent me and i think i've found out why you can't get out i suppose'  'no i can't  what are you doing'  'clearing away a huge heap of stones'  'there's a princess' exclaimed curdie in a tone of delight but still speaking in little more than a whisper  'i can't think how you got here though'  'my grandmother sent me after her thread'  'i don't know what you mean' said curdie 'but so you're there it doesn't much matter'  'oh yes it does' returned irene  'i should never have been here but for her'  'you can tell me all about it when we get out then  there's no time to lose now'said curdie  and irene went to work as fresh as when she began  'there's such a lot of stones' she said  'it will take me a long time to get them all away'  'how far on have you got' asked curdie  'i've got about the half away but the other half is ever so much bigger'  'i don't think you will have to move the lower half  do you see a slab laid up against the wall'  irene looked and felt about with her hands and soon perceived the outlines of the slab  'yes' she answered 'i do'  'then i think' rejoined curdie 'when you have cleared the slab about half-way down or a bit more i shall be able to push it over'  'i must follow my thread' returned irene 'whatever i do'  'what do you mean' exclaimed curdie 'you will see when you get out' answered the princess and went on harder than ever  but she was soon satisfied that what curdie wanted done and what the thread wanted done were one and the same thing  for she not only saw that by following the turns of the thread she had been clearing the face of the slab but that a little more than half-way down the thread went through the chink between the slab and the wall into the place where curdie was confined so that she could not follow it any farther until the slab was out of her way as soon as she found this she said in a right joyous whisper   'now curdie i think if you were to give a great push the slab would tumble over'  'stand quite clear of it then' said curdie 'and let me know when you are ready'  irene got off the heap and stood on one side of it  'now curdie' she cried  curdie gave a great rush with his shoulder against it  out tumbled the slab on the heap and out crept curdie over the top of it  'you've saved my life irene' he whispered  'oh curdie i'm so glad  let's get out of this horrid place as fast as we can'  'that's easier said than done' returned he  'oh no it's quite easy' said irene  'we have only to follow my thread  i am sure that it's going to take us out now'  she had already begun to follow it over the fallen slab into the hole while curdie was searching the floor of the cavern for his pickaxe  'here it is' he cried  'no it is not' he added in a disappointed tone  'what can it be then  i declare it's a torch that is jolly it's better almost than my pickaxe  much better if it weren't for those stone shoes' he went on as he lighted the torch by blowing the last embers of the expiring fire  when he looked up with the lighted torch casting a glare into the great darkness of the huge cavern he caught sight of irene disappearing in the hole out of which he had himself just come  'where are you going there' he cried  'that's not the way out that's where i couldn't get out'  'i know that' whispered irene  'but this is the way my thread goes and i must follow it'  'what nonsense the child talks' said curdie to himself  'i must follow her though and see that she comes to no harm  she will soon find she can't get out that way and then she will come with me'  so he crept over the slab once more into the hole with his torch in his hand  but when he looked about in it he could see her nowhere  and now he discovered that although the hole was narrow it was much longer than he had supposed for in one direction the roof came down very low and the hole went off in a narrow passage of which he could not see the end  the princess must have crept in there  he got on his knees and one hand holding the torch with the other and crept after her the hole twisted about in some parts so low that he could hardly get through in others so high that he could not see the roof but everywhere it was narrow far too narrow for a goblin to get through and so i presume they never thought that curdie might  he was beginning to feel very uncomfortable lest something should have befallen the princess when he heard her voice almost close to his ear whispering   'aren't you coming curdie'  and when he turned the next corner there she stood waiting for him  'i knew you couldn't go wrong in that narrow hole but now you must keep by me for here is a great wide place' she said  'i can't understand it' said curdie half to himself half to irene  'never mind' she returned  'wait till we get out'  curdie utterly astonished that she had already got so far and by a path he had known nothing of thought it better to let her do as she pleased  'at all events' he said again to himself 'i know nothing about the way miner as i am and she seems to think she does know something about it though how she should passes my comprehension  so she's just as likely to find her way as i am and as she insists on taking the lead i must follow  we can't be much worse off than we are anyhow'  reasoning thus he followed her a few steps and came out in another great cavern across which irene walked in a straight line as confidently as if she knew every step of the way  curdie went on after her flashing his torch about and trying to see something of what lay around them suddenly he started back a pace as the light fell upon something close by which irene was passing  it was a platform of rock raised a few feet from the floor and covered with sheepskins upon which lay two horrible figures asleep at once recognized by curdie as the king and queen of the goblins  he lowered his torch instantly lest the light should awake them  as he did so it flashed upon his pickaxe lying by the side of the queen whose hand lay close by the handle of it  'stop one moment' he whispered  'hold my torch and don't let the light on their faces'  irene shuddered when she saw the frightful creatures whom she had passed without observing them but she did as he requested and turning her back held the torch low in front of her  curdie drew his pickaxe carefully away and as he did so spied one of her feet projecting from under the skins  the great clumsy granite shoe exposed thus to his hand was a temptation not to be resisted  he laid hold of it and with cautious efforts drew it off  the moment he succeeded he saw to his astonishment that what he had sung in ignorance to annoy the queen was actually true  she had six horrible toes  overjoyed at his success and seeing by the huge bump in the sheepskins where the other foot was he proceeded to lift them gently for if he could only succeed in carrying away the other shoe as well he would be no more afraid of the goblins than of so many flies  but as he pulled at the second shoe the queen gave a growl and sat up in bed  the same instant the king awoke also and sat up beside her  'run irene' cried curdie for though he was not now in the least afraid for himself he was for the princess  irene looked once round saw the fearful creatures awake and like the wise princess she was dashed the torch on the ground and extinguished it crying out   'here curdie take my hand'  he darted to her side forgetting neither the queen's shoe nor his pickaxe and caught hold of her hand as she sped fearlessly where her thread guided her  they heard the queen give a great bellow but they had a good start for it would be some time before they could get torches lighted to pursue them  just as they thought they saw a gleam behind them the thread brought them to a very narrow opening through which irene crept easily and curdie with difficulty  'now'said curdie 'i think we shall be safe'  'of course we shall' returned irene  'why do you think so'asked curdie  'because my grandmother is taking care of us'  'that's all nonsense' said curdie  'i don't know what you mean'  'then if you don't know what i mean what right have you to call it nonsense' asked the princess a little offended  'i beg your pardon irene' said curdie 'i did not mean to vex you'  'of course not' returned the princess  'but why do you think we shall be safe'  'because the king and queen are far too stout to get through that hole'  'there might be ways round' said the princess  'to be sure there might  we are not out of it yet' acknowledged curdie  'but what do you mean by the king and queen' asked the princess 'i should never call such creatures as those a king and a queen'  'their own people do though' answered curdie  the princess asked more questions and curdie as they walked leisurely along gave her a full account not only of the character and habits of the goblins so far as he knew them but of his own adventures with them beginning from the very night after that in which he had met her and lootie upon the mountain  when he had finished he begged irene to tell him how it was that she had come to his rescue  so irene too had to tell a long story which she did in rather a roundabout manner interrupted by many questions concerning things she had not explained but her tale as he did not believe more than half of it left everything as unaccountable to him as before and he was nearly as much perplexed as to what he must think of the princess  he could not believe that she was deliberately telling stories and the only conclusion he could come to was that lootie had been playing the child tricks inventing no end of lies to frighten her for her own purposes  'but how ever did lootie come to let you go into the mountains alone'he asked  'lootie knows nothing about it  i left her fast asleep at least i think so  i hope my grandmother won't let her get into trouble for it wasn't her fault at all as my grandmother very well knows'  'but how did you find your way to me' persisted curdie  'i told you already' answered irene 'by keeping my finger upon my grandmother's thread as i am doing now'  'you don't mean you've got the thread there'  'of course i do  i have told you so ten times already  i have hardly except when i was removing the stones taken my finger off it there' she added guiding curdie's hand to the thread 'you feel it yourself don't you'  'i feel nothing at all' replied curdie 'then what can be the matter with your finger  i feel it perfectly  to be sure it is very thin and in the sunlight looks just like the thread of a spider though there are many of them twisted together to make it but for all that i can't think why you shouldn't feel it as well as i do'  curdie was too polite to say he did not believe there was any thread there at all  what he did say was   'well i can make nothing of it'  'i can though and you must be glad of that for it will do for both of us'  'we're not out yet' said curdie  'we soon shall be' returned irene confidently  and now the thread went downwards and led irene's hand to a hole in the floor of the cavern whence came a sound of running water which they had been hearing for some time  'it goes into the ground now curdie' she said stopping  he had been listening to another sound which his practised ear had caught long ago and which also had been growing louder  it was the noise the goblin-miners made at their work and they seemed to be at no great distance now  irene heard it the moment she stopped  'what is that noise' she asked  'do you know curdie'  'yes  it is the goblins digging and burrowing' he answered  'and you don't know what they do it for'  'no i haven't the least idea  would you like to see them' he asked wishing to have another try after their secret  'if my thread took me there i shouldn't much mind but i don't want to see them and i can't leave my thread  it leads me down into the hole and we had better go at once'  'very well  shall i go in first' said curdie  'no better not  you can't feel the thread' she answered stepping down through a narrow break in the floor of the cavern 'oh' she cried 'i am in the water  it is running strong but it is not deep and there is just room to walk  make haste curdie'  he tried but the hole was too small for him to get in  'go on a little bit he said shouldering his pickaxe  in a few moments he had cleared a larger opening and followed her  they went on down and down with the running water curdie getting more and more afraid it was leading them to some terrible gulf in the heart of the mountain in one or two places he had to break away the rock to make room before even irene could get through at least without hurting herself  but at length they spied a glimmer of light and in a minute more they were almost blinded by the full sunlight into which they emerged  it was some little time before the princess could see well enough to discover that they stood in her own garden close by the seat on which she and her king-papa had sat that afternoon  they had come out by the channel of the little stream  she danced and clapped her hands with delight  'now curdie' she cried 'won't you believe what i told you about my grandmother and her thread'  for she had felt all the time that curdie was not believing what she told him  'there don't you see it shining on before us' she added  'i don't see anything' persisted curdie  'then you must believe without seeing' said the princess 'for you can't deny it has brought us out of the mountain'  'i can't deny we are out of the mountain and i should be very ungrateful indeed to deny that you had brought me out of it'  'i couldn't have done it but for the thread' persisted irene  'that's the part i don't understand'  'well come along and lootie will get you something to eat  i am sure you must want it very much'  'indeed i do  but my father and mother will be so anxious about me i must make haste first up the mountain to tell my mother and then down into the mine again to let my father know'  'very well curdie but you can't get out without coming this way and i will take you through the house for that is nearest'  they met no one by the way for indeed as before the people were here and there and everywhere searching for the princess  when they got in irene found that the thread as she had half expected went up the old staircase and a new thought struck her  she turned to curdie and said   'my grandmother wants me  do come up with me and see her  then you will know that i have been telling you the truth  do come to please me curdie  i can't bear you should think what i say is not true'  'i never doubted you believed what you said' returned curdie  'i only thought you had some fancy in your head that was not correct' 'but do come dear curdie'  the little miner could not withstand this appeal and though he felt shy in what seemed to him a huge grand house he yielded and followed her up the stair    chapter 22  the old lady and curdie  up the stair then they went and the next and the next and through the long rows of empty rooms and up the little tower stair irene growing happier and happier as she ascended  there was no answer when she knocked at length at the door of the workroom nor could she hear any sound of the spinning-wheel and once more her heart sank within her but only for one moment as she turned and knocked at the other door  'come in' answered the sweet voice of her grandmother and irene opened the door and entered followed by curdie  'you darling' cried the lady who was seated by a fire of red roses mingled with white  'i've been waiting for you and indeed getting a little anxious about you and beginning to think whether i had not better go and fetch you myself'  as she spoke she took the little princess in her arms and placed her upon her lap  she was dressed in white now and looking if possible more lovely than ever  'i've brought curdie grandmother  he wouldn't believe what i told him and so i've brought him'  'yes i see him  he is a good boy curdie and a brave boy aren't you glad you've got him out'  'yes grandmother  but it wasn't very good of him not to believe me when i was telling him the truth'  'people must believe what they can and those who believe more must not be hard upon those who believe less  i doubt if you would have believed it all yourself if you hadn't seen some of it'  'ah yes grandmother i dare say  i'm sure you are right  but he'll believe now'  'i don't know that' replied her grandmother  'won't you curdie' said irene looking round at him as she asked the question  he was standing in the middle of the floor staring and looking strangely bewildered  this she thought came of his astonishment at the beauty of the lady  'make a bow to my grandmother curdie' she said  'i don't see any grandmother' answered curdie rather gruffly  'don't see my grandmother when i'm sitting in her lap' exclaimed the princess  'no i don't' reiterated curdie in an offended tone  'don't you see the lovely fire of roses white ones amongst them this time' asked irene almost as bewildered as he  'no i don't' answered curdie almost sulkily  'nor the blue bed  nor the rose-coloured counterpane nor the beautiful light like the moon hanging from the roof'  'you're making game of me your royal highness and after what we have come through together this day i don't think it is kind of you' said curdie feeling very much hurt  'then what do you see' asked irene who perceived at once that for her not to believe him was at least as bad as for him not to believe her  'i see a big bare garret-room like the one in mother's cottage only big enough to take the cottage itself in and leave a good margin all round' answered curdie  'and what more do you see'  'i see a tub and a heap of musty straw and a withered apple and a ray of sunlight coming through a hole in the middle of the roof and shining on your head and making all the place look a curious dusky brown  i think you had better drop it princess and go down to the nursery like a good girl'  'but don't you hear my grandmother talking to me' asked irene almost crying  'no  i hear the cooing of a lot of pigeons  if you won't come down i will go without you  i think that will be better anyhow for i'm sure nobody who met us would believe a word we said to them  they would think we made it all up  i don't expect anybody but my own father and mother to believe me  they know i wouldn't tell a story'  'and yet you won't believe me curdie' expostulated the princess now fairly crying with vexation and sorrow at the gulf between her and curdie  'no  i can't and i can't help it' said curdie turning to leave the room  'what shall i do grandmother' sobbed the princess turning her face round upon the lady's bosom and shaking with suppressed sobs  'you must give him time' said her grandmother 'and you must be content not to be believed for a while  it is very hard to bear but i have had to bear it and shall have to bear it many a time yet  i will take care of what curdie thinks of you in the end you must let him go now'  'you're not coming are you' asked curdie  'no curdie my grandmother says i must let you go  turn to the right when you get to the bottom of all the stairs and that will take you to the hall where the great door is'  'oh i don't doubt i can find my way without you princess or your old grannie's thread either' said curdie quite rudely  'oh curdie  curdie'  'i wish i had gone home at once  i'm very much obliged to you irene for getting me out of that hole but i wish you hadn't made a fool of me afterwards'  he said this as he opened the door which he left open and without another word went down the stair  irene listened with dismay to his departing footsteps  then turning again to the lady   'what does it all mean grandmother' she sobbed and burst into fresh tears  'it means my love that i did not mean to show myself  curdie is not yet able to believe some things  seeing is not believing it is only seeing  you remember i told you that if lootie were to see me she would rub her eyes forget the half she saw and call the other half nonsense'  'yes but i should have thought curdie '  'you are right  curdie is much farther on than lootie and you will see what will come of it  but in the meantime you must be content i say to be misunderstood for a while  we are all very anxious to be understood and it is very hard not to be  but there is one thing much more necessary'  'what is that grandmother'  'to understand other people'  'yes grandmother  i must be fair for if i'm not fair to other people i'm not worth being understood myself  i see  so as curdie can't help it i will not be vexed with him but just wait'  'there's my own dear child' said her grandmother and pressed her close to her bosom  'why weren't you in your workroom when we came up grandmother' asked irene after a few moments' silence  'if i had been there curdie would have seen me well enough  but why should i be there rather than in this beautiful room'  'i thought you would be spinning'  'i've nobody to spin for just at present  i never spin without knowing for whom i am spinning'  'that reminds me there is one thing that puzzles me' said the princess  'how are you to get the thread out of the mountain again surely you won't have to make another for me  that would be such a trouble'  the lady set her down and rose and went to the fire  putting in her hand she drew it out again and held up the shining ball between her finger and thumb  'i've got it now you see' she said coming back to the princess 'all ready for you when you want it'  going to her cabinet she laid it in the same drawer as before  'and here is your ring' she added taking it from the little finger of her left hand and putting it on the forefinger of irene's right hand  'oh thank you grandmother i feel so safe now'  'you are very tired my child' the lady went on  'your hands are hurt with the stones and i have counted nine bruises on you  just look what you are like'  and she held up to her a little mirror which she had brought from the cabinet  the princess burst into a merry laugh at the sight she was so draggled with the stream and dirty with creeping through narrow places that if she had seen the reflection without knowing it was a reflection she would have taken herself for some gipsy child whose face was washed and hair combed about once in a month the lady laughed too and lifting her again upon her knee took off her cloak and night-gown  then she carried her to the side of the room  irene wondered what she was going to do with her but asked no questions only starting a little when she found that she was going to lay her in the large silver bath for as she looked into it again she saw no bottom but the stars shining miles away as it seemed in a great blue gulf  her hands closed involuntarily on the beautiful arms that held her and that was all  the lady pressed her once more to her bosom saying   'do not be afraid my child'  'no grandmother' answered the princess with a little gasp and the next instant she sank in the clear cool water  when she opened her eyes she saw nothing but a strange lovely blue over and beneath and all about her  the lady and the beautiful room had vanished from her sight and she seemed utterly alone but instead of being afraid she felt more than happy perfectly blissful  and from somewhere came the voice of the lady singing a strange sweet song of which she could distinguish every word but of the sense she had only a feeling no understanding  nor could she remember a single line after it was gone  it vanished like the poetry in a dream as fast as it came  in after years however she would sometimes fancy that snatches of melody suddenly rising in her brain must be little phrases and fragments of the air of that song and the very fancy would make her happier and abler to do her duty  how long she lay in the water she did not know  it seemed a long time not from weariness but from pleasure  but at last she felt the beautiful hands lay hold of her and through the gurgling water she was lifted out into the lovely room  the lady carried her to the fire and sat down with her in her lap and dried her tenderly with the softest towel  it was so different from lootie's drying when the lady had done she stooped to the fire and drew from it her night-gown as white as snow  'how delicious' exclaimed the princess  'it smells of all the roses in the world i think'  when she stood up on the floor she felt as if she had been made over again  every bruise and all weariness were gone and her hands were soft and whole as ever  'now i am going to put you to bed for a good sleep' said her grandmother  'but what will lootie be thinking  and what am i to say to her when she asks me where i have been'  'don't trouble yourself about it  you will find it all come right' said her grandmother and laid her into the blue bed under the rosy counterpane  'there is just one thing more' said irene  'i am a little anxious about curdie  as i brought him into the house i ought to have seen him safe on his way home'  'i took care of all that' answered the lady  'i told you to let him go and therefore i was bound to look after him  nobody saw him and he is now eating a good dinner in his mother's cottage far up in the mountain'  'then i will go to sleep' said irene and in a few minutes she was fast asleep    chapter 23  curdie and his mother  curdie went up the mountain neither whistling nor singing for he was vexed with irene for taking him in as he called it and he was vexed with himself for having spoken to her so angrily  his mother gave a cry of joy when she saw him and at once set about getting him something to eat asking him questions all the time which he did not answer so cheerfully as usual  when his meal was ready she left him to eat it and hurried to the mine to let his father know he was safe when she came back she found him fast asleep upon her bed nor did he wake until his father came home in the evening  'now curdie' his mother said as they sat at supper 'tell us the whole story from beginning to end just as it all happened'  curdie obeyed and told everything to the point where they came out upon the lawn in the garden of the king's house  'and what happened after that' asked his mother  'you haven't told us all  you ought to be very happy at having got away from those demons and instead of that i never saw you so gloomy  there must be something more  besides you do not speak of that lovely child as i should like to hear you  she saved your life at the risk of her own and yet somehow you don't seem to think much of it'  'she talked such nonsense' answered curdie 'and told me a pack of things that weren't a bit true and i can't get over it'  'what were they' asked his father  'your mother may be able to throw some light upon them'  then curdie made a clean breast of it and told them everything  they all sat silent for some time pondering the strange tale  at last curdie's mother spoke  'you confess my boy' she said 'there is something about the whole affair you do not understand'  'yes of course mother' he answered  'i cannot understand how a child knowing nothing about the mountain or even that i was shut up in it should come all that way alone straight to where i was and then after getting me out of the hole lead me out of the mountain too where i should not have known a step of the way if it had been as light as in the open air'  'then you have no right to say what she told you was not true  she did take you out and she must have had something to guide her  why not a thread as well as a rope or anything else  there is something you cannot explain and her explanation may be the right one'  'it's no explanation at all mother and i can't believe it'  'that may be only because you do not understand it  if you did you would probably find it was an explanation and believe it thoroughly i don't blame you for not being able to believe it but i do blame you for fancying such a child would try to deceive you  why should she depend upon it she told you all she knew until you had found a better way of accounting for it all you might at least have been more sparing of your judgement'  'that is what something inside me has been saying all the time' said curdie hanging down his head  'but what do you make of the grandmother  that is what i can't get over  to take me up to an old garret and try to persuade me against the sight of my own eyes that it was a beautiful room with blue walls and silver stars and no end of things in it when there was nothing there but an old tub and a withered apple and a heap of straw and a sunbeam  it was too bad  she might have had some old woman there at least to pass for her precious grandmother'  'didn't she speak as if she saw those other things herself curdie'  'yes  that's what bothers me  you would have thought she really meant and believed that she saw every one of the things she talked about and not one of them there  it was too bad i say'  'perhaps some people can see things other people can't see curdie' said his mother very gravely  'i think i will tell you something i saw myself once only perhaps you won't believe me either'  'oh mother mother' cried curdie bursting into tears 'i don't deserve that surely'  'but what i am going to tell you is very strange' persisted his mother 'and if having heard it you were to say i must have been dreaming i don't know that i should have any right to be vexed with you though i know at least that i was not asleep'  'do tell me mother  perhaps it will help me to think better of the princess'  'that's why i am tempted to tell you' replied his mother  'but first i may as well mention that according to old whispers there is something more than common about the king's family and the queen was of the same blood for they were cousins of some degree there were strange stories told concerning them all good stories but strange very strange  what they were i cannot tell for i only remember the faces of my grandmother and my mother as they talked together about them  there was wonder and awe not fear in their eyes and they whispered and never spoke aloud  but what i saw myself was this  your father was going to work in the mine one night and i had been down with his supper  it was soon after we were married and not very long before you were born  he came with me to the mouth of the mine and left me to go home alone for i knew the way almost as well as the floor of our own cottage  it was pretty dark and in some parts of the road where the rocks overhung nearly quite dark  but i got along perfectly well never thinking of being afraid until i reached a spot you know well enough curdie where the path has to make a sharp turn out of the way of a great rock on the left-hand side  when i got there i was suddenly surrounded by about half a dozen of the cobs the first i had ever seen although i had heard tell of them often enough one of them blocked up the path and they all began tormenting and teasing me in a way it makes me shudder to think of even now'  'if i had only been with you' cried father and son in a breath  the mother gave a funny little smile and went on  'they had some of their horrible creatures with them too and i must confess i was dreadfully frightened  they had torn my clothes very much and i was afraid they were going to tear myself to pieces when suddenly a great white soft light shone upon me  i looked up  a broad ray like a shining road came down from a large globe of silvery light not very high up indeed not quite so high as the horizon so it could not have been a new star or another moon or anything of that sort  the cobs dropped persecuting me and looked dazed and i thought they were going to run away but presently they began again  the same moment however down the path from the globe of light came a bird shining like silver in the sun  it gave a few rapid flaps first and then with its wings straight out shot sliding down the slope of the light  it looked to me just like a white pigeon  but whatever it was when the cobs caught sight of it coming straight down upon them they took to their heels and scampered away across the mountain leaving me safe only much frightened  as soon as it had sent them off the bird went gliding again up the light and the moment it reached the globe the light disappeared just as if a shutter had been closed over a window and i saw it no more  but i had no more trouble with the cobs that night or ever after'  'how strange' exclaimed curdie  'yes it was strange but i can't help believing it whether you do or not' said his mother  'it's exactly as your mother told it to me the very next morning' said his father  'you don't think i'm doubting my own mother' cried curdie 'there are other people in the world quite as well worth believing as your own mother' said his mother  'i don't know that she's so much the fitter to be believed that she happens to be your mother mr curdie  there are mothers far more likely to tell lies than the little girl i saw talking to the primroses a few weeks ago  if she were to lie i should begin to doubt my own word'  'but princesses have told lies as well as other people' said curdie  'yes but not princesses like that child  she's a good girl i am certain and that's more than being a princess  depend upon it you will have to be sorry for behaving so to her curdie  you ought at least to have held your tongue'  'i am sorry now' answered curdie  'you ought to go and tell her so then'  'i don't see how i could manage that  they wouldn't let a miner boy like me have a word with her alone and i couldn't tell her before that nurse of hers  she'd be asking ever so many questions and i don't know how many the little princess would like me to answer  she told me that lootie didn't know anything about her coming to get me out of the mountain  i am certain she would have prevented her somehow if she had known it  but i may have a chance before long and meantime i must try to do something for her  i think father i have got on the track at last'  'have you indeed my boy' said peter  'i am sure you deserve some success you have worked very hard for it  what have you found out'  'it's difficult you know father inside the mountain especially in the dark and not knowing what turns you have taken to tell the lie of things outside'  'impossible my boy without a chart or at least a compass' returned his father  'well i think i have nearly discovered in what direction the cobs are mining  if i am right i know something else that i can put to it and then one and one will make three'  'they very often do curdie as we miners ought to be very well aware now tell us my boy what the two things are and see whether we can guess at the same third as you'  'i don't see what that has to do with the princess' interposed his mother  'i will soon let you see that mother  perhaps you may think me foolish but until i am sure there is nothing in my present fancy i am more determined than ever to go on with my observations  just as we came to the channel by which we got out i heard the miners at work somewhere near i think down below us  now since i began to watch them they have mined a good half-mile in a straight line and so far as i am aware they are working in no other part of the mountain  but i never could tell in what direction they were going  when we came out in the king's garden however i thought at once whether it was possible they were working towards the king's house and what i want to do tonight is to make sure whether they are or not  i will take a light with me '  'oh curdie' cried his mother 'then they will see you'  'i'm no more afraid of them now than i was before' rejoined curdie 'now that i've got this precious shoe  they can't make another such in a hurry and one bare foot will do for my purpose woman as she may be i won't spare her next time  but i shall be careful with my light for i don't want them to see me  i won't stick it in my hat'  'go on then and tell us what you mean to do'  'i mean to take a bit of paper with me and a pencil and go in at the mouth of the stream by which we came out  i shall mark on the paper as near as i can the angle of every turning i take until i find the cobs at work and so get a good idea in what direction they are going  if it should prove to be nearly parallel with the stream i shall know it is towards the king's house they are working'  'and what if you should  how much wiser will you be then'  'wait a minute mother dear  i told you that when i came upon the royal family in the cave they were talking of their prince harelip they called him marrying a sun-woman that means one of us one with toes to her feet  now in the speech one of them made that night at their great gathering of which i heard only a part he said that peace would be secured for a generation at least by the pledge the prince would hold for the good behaviour of her relatives  that's what he said and he must have meant the sun-woman the prince was to marry  i am quite sure the king is much too proud to wish his son to marry any but a princess and much too knowing to fancy that his having a peasant woman for a wife would be of any great advantage to them'  'i see what you are driving at now' said his mother  'but' said his father 'our king would dig the mountain to the plain before he would have his princess the wife of a cob if he were ten times a prince'  'yes but they think so much of themselves' said his mother 'small creatures always do  the bantam is the proudest cock in my little yard'  'and i fancy' said curdie 'if they once got her they would tell the king they would kill her except he consented to the marriage'  'they might say so' said his father 'but they wouldn't kill her they would keep her alive for the sake of the hold it gave them over our king  whatever he did to them they would threaten to do the same to the princess'  'and they are bad enough to torment her just for their own amusement i know that' said his mother  'anyhow i will keep a watch on them and see what they are up to' said curdie  'it's too horrible to think of  i daren't let myself do it  but they shan't have her at least if i can help it  so mother dear my clue is all right will you get me a bit of paper and a pencil and a lump of pease pudding and i will set out at once  i saw a place where i can climb over the wall of the garden quite easily'  'you must mind and keep out of the way of the men on the watch' said his mother  'that i will  i don't want them to know anything about it  they would spoil it all  the cobs would only try some other plan they are such obstinate creatures  i shall take good care mother they won't kill and eat me either if they should come upon me  so you needn't mind them'  his mother got him what he had asked for and curdie set out close beside the door by which the princess left the garden for the mountain stood a great rock and by climbing it curdie got over the wall  he tied his clue to a stone just inside the channel of the stream and took his pickaxe with him  he had not gone far before he encountered a horrid creature coming towards the mouth  the spot was too narrow for two of almost any size or shape and besides curdie had no wish to let the creature pass  not being able to use his pickaxe however he had a severe struggle with him and it was only after receiving many bites some of them bad that he succeeded in killing him with his pocket-knife  having dragged him out he made haste to get in again before another should stop up the way  i need not follow him farther in this night's adventures  he returned to his breakfast satisfied that the goblins were mining in the direction of the palace on so low a level that their intention must he thought be to burrow under the walls of the king's house and rise up inside it in order he fully believed to lay hands on the little princess and carry her off for a wife to their horrid harelip    chapter 24  irene behaves like a princess  when the princess awoke from the sweetest of sleeps she found her nurse bending over her the housekeeper looking over the nurse's shoulder and the laundry-maid looking over the housekeeper's the room was full of women-servants and the gentlemen-at-arms with a long column of servants behind them were peeping or trying to peep in at the door of the nursery  'are those horrid creatures gone' asked the princess remembering first what had terrified her in the morning  'you naughty naughty little princess' cried lootie  her face was very pale with red streaks in it and she looked as if she were going to shake her but irene said nothing only waited to hear what should come next  'how could you get under the clothes like that and make us all fancy you were lost  and keep it up all day too  you are the most obstinate child  it's anything but fun to us i can tell you'  it was the only way the nurse could account for her disappearance  'i didn't do that lootie' said irene very quietly  'don't tell stories' cried her nurse quite rudely  'i shall tell you nothing at all' said irene  'that's just as bad' said the nurse  'just as bad to say nothing at all as to tell stories' exclaimed the princess  'i will ask my papa about that  he won't say so and i don't think he will like you to say so'  'tell me directly what you mean by it' screamed the nurse half wild with anger at the princess and fright at the possible consequences to herself  'when i tell you the truth lootie' said the princess who somehow did not feel at all angry 'you say to me don't tell stories  it seems i must tell stories before you will believe me'  'you are very rude princess' said the nurse  'you are so rude lootie that i will not speak to you again till you are sorry  why should i when i know you will not believe me' returned the princess  for she did know perfectly well that if she were to tell lootie what she had been about the more she went on to tell her the less would she believe her  'you are the most provoking child' cried her nurse  'you deserve to be well punished for your wicked behaviour'  'please mrs housekeeper' said the princess 'will you take me to your room and keep me till my king-papa comes  i will ask him to come as soon as he can'  every one stared at these words  up to this moment they had all regarded her as little more than a baby  but the housekeeper was afraid of the nurse and sought to patch matters up saying   'i am sure princess nursie did not mean to be rude to you'  'i do not think my papa would wish me to have a nurse who spoke to me as lootie does  if she thinks i tell lies she had better either say so to my papa or go away  sir walter will you take charge of me'  'with the greatest of pleasure princess' answered the captain of the gentlemen-at-arms walking with his great stride into the room  the crowd of servants made eager way for him and he bowed low before the little princess's bed  'i shall send my servant at once on the fastest horse in the stable to tell your king-papa that your royal highness desires his presence  when you have chosen one of these under-servants to wait upon you i shall order the room to be cleared'  'thank you very much sir walter' said the princess and her eye glanced towards a rosy-cheeked girl who had lately come to the house as a scullery-maid  but when lootie saw the eyes of her dear princess going in search of another instead of her she fell upon her knees by the bedside and burst into a great cry of distress  'i think sir walter' said the princess 'i will keep lootie  but i put myself under your care and you need not trouble my king-papa until i speak to you again  will you all please to go away  i am quite safe and well and i did not hide myself for the sake either of amusing myself or of troubling my people  lootie will you please to dress me'    chapter 25  curdie comes to grief  everything was for some time quiet above ground  the king was still away in a distant part of his dominions  the men-at-arms kept watching about the house  they had been considerably astonished by finding at the foot of the rock in the garden the hideous body of the goblin creature killed by curdie but they came to the conclusion that it had been slain in the mines and had crept out there to die and except an occasional glimpse of a live one they saw nothing to cause alarm curdie kept watching in the mountain and the goblins kept burrowing deeper into the earth  as long as they went deeper there was curdie judged no immediate danger  to irene the summer was as full of pleasure as ever and for a long time although she often thought of her grandmother during the day and often dreamed about her at night she did not see her  the kids and the flowers were as much her delight as ever and she made as much friendship with the miners' children she met on the mountain as lootie would permit but lootie had very foolish notions concerning the dignity of a princess not understanding that the truest princess is just the one who loves all her brothers and sisters best and who is most able to do them good by being humble towards them  at the same time she was considerably altered for the better in her behaviour to the princess  she could not help seeing that she was no longer a mere child but wiser than her age would account for  she kept foolishly whispering to the servants however sometimes that the princess was not right in her mind sometimes that she was too good to live and other nonsense of the same sort  all this time curdie had to be sorry without a chance of confessing that he had behaved so unkindly to the princess  this perhaps made him the more diligent in his endeavours to serve her his mother and he often talked on the subject and she comforted him and told him she was sure he would some day have the opportunity he so much desired  here i should like to remark for the sake of princes and princesses in general that it is a low and contemptible thing to refuse to confess a fault or even an error  if a true princess has done wrong she is always uneasy until she has had an opportunity of throwing the wrongness away from her by saying  'i did it and i wish i had not and i am sorry for having done it' so you see there is some ground for supposing that curdie was not a miner only but a prince as well  many such instances have been known in the world's history  at length however he began to see signs of a change in the proceedings of the goblin excavators  they were going no deeper but had commenced running on a level and he watched them therefore more closely than ever  all at once one night coming to a slope of very hard rock they began to ascend along the inclined plane of its surface  having reached its top they went again on a level for a night or two after which they began to ascend once more and kept on at a pretty steep angle  at length curdie judged it time to transfer his observation to another quarter and the next night he did not go to the mine at all but leaving his pickaxe and clue at home and taking only his usual lumps of bread and pease pudding went down the mountain to the king's house  he climbed over the wall and remained in the garden the whole night creeping on hands and knees from one spot to the other and lying at full length with his ear to the ground listening  but he heard nothing except the tread of the men-at-arms as they marched about whose observation as the night was cloudy and there was no moon he had little difficulty in avoiding  for several following nights he continued to haunt the garden and listen but with no success  at length early one evening whether it was that he had got careless of his own safety or that the growing moon had become strong enough to expose him his watching came to a sudden end  he was creeping from behind the rock where the stream ran out for he had been listening all round it in the hope it might convey to his ear some indication of the whereabouts of the goblin miners when just as he came into the moonlight on the lawn a whizz in his ear and a blow upon his leg startled him  he instantly squatted in the hope of eluding further notice  but when he heard the sound of running feet he jumped up to take the chance of escape by flight he fell however with a keen shoot of pain for the bolt of a crossbow had wounded his leg and the blood was now streaming from it  he was instantly laid hold of by two or three of the men-at-arms  it was useless to struggle and he submitted in silence  'it's a boy' cried several of them together in a tone of amazement 'i thought it was one of those demons  what are you about here'  'going to have a little rough usage apparently' said curdie laughing as the men shook him  'impertinence will do you no good  you have no business here in the king's grounds and if you don't give a true account of yourself you shall fare as a thief'  'why what else could he be' said one  'he might have been after a lost kid you know' suggested another  'i see no good in trying to excuse him  he has no business here anyhow'  'let me go away then if you please' said curdie  'but we don't please not except you give a good account of yourself'  'i don't feel quite sure whether i can trust you' said curdie  'we are the king's own men-at-arms' said the captain courteously for he was taken with curdie's appearance and courage  'well i will tell you all about it if you will promise to listen to me and not do anything rash'  'i call that cool' said one of the party laughing  'he will tell us what mischief he was about if we promise to do as pleases him'  'i was about no mischief' said curdie  but ere he could say more he turned faint and fell senseless on the grass  then first they discovered that the bolt they had shot taking him for one of the goblin creatures had wounded him  they carried him into the house and laid him down in the hall  the report spread that they had caught a robber and the servants crowded in to see the villain  amongst the rest came the nurse the moment she saw him she exclaimed with indignation   'i declare it's the same young rascal of a miner that was rude to me and the princess on the mountain  he actually wanted to kiss the princess  i took good care of that the wretch  and he was prowling about was he  just like his impudence' the princess being fast asleep she could misrepresent at her pleasure  when he heard this the captain although he had considerable doubt of its truth resolved to keep curdie a prisoner until they could search into the affair  so after they had brought him round a little and attended to his wound which was rather a bad one they laid him still exhausted from the loss of blood upon a mattress in a disused room one of those already so often mentioned and locked the door and left him  he passed a troubled night and in the morning they found him talking wildly  in the evening he came to himself but felt very weak and his leg was exceedingly painful  wondering where he was and seeing one of the men-at-arms in the room he began to question him and soon recalled the events of the preceding night  as he was himself unable to watch any more he told the soldier all he knew about the goblins and begged him to tell his companions and stir them up to watch with tenfold vigilance but whether it was that he did not talk quite coherently or that the whole thing appeared incredible certainly the man concluded that curdie was only raving still and tried to coax him into holding his tongue  this of course annoyed curdie dreadfully who now felt in his turn what it was not to be believed and the consequence was that his fever returned and by the time when at his persistent entreaties the captain was called there could be no doubt that he was raving  they did for him what they could and promised everything he wanted but with no intention of fulfilment  at last he went to sleep and when at length his sleep grew profound and peaceful they left him locked the door again and withdrew intending to revisit him early in the morning    chapter 26  the goblin-miners  that same night several of the servants were having a chat together before going to bed  'what can that noise be' said one of the housemaids who had been listening for a moment or two  'i've heard it the last two nights' said the cook  'if there were any about the place i should have taken it for rats but my tom keeps them far enough'  'i've heard though' said the scullery-maid 'that rats move about in great companies sometimes  there may be an army of them invading us i've heard the noises yesterday and today too'  'it'll be grand fun then for my tom and mrs housekeeper's bob' said the cook  'they'll be friends for once in their lives and fight on the same side  i'll engage tom and bob together will put to flight any number of rats'  'it seems to me' said the nurse 'that the noises are much too loud for that  i have heard them all day and my princess has asked me several times what they could be  sometimes they sound like distant thunder and sometimes like the noises you hear in the mountain from those horrid miners underneath'  'i shouldn't wonder' said the cook 'if it was the miners after all they may have come on some hole in the mountain through which the noises reach to us  they are always boring and blasting and breaking you know'  as he spoke there came a great rolling rumble beneath them and the house quivered  they all started up in affright and rushing to the hall found the gentlemen-at-arms in consternation also they had sent to wake their captain who said from their description that it must have been an earthquake an occurrence which although very rare in that country had taken place almost within the century and then went to bed again strange to say and fell fast asleep without once thinking of curdie or associating the noises they had heard with what he had told them  he had not believed curdie  if he had he would at once have thought of what he had said and would have taken precautions  as they heard nothing more they concluded that sir walter was right and that the danger was over for perhaps another hundred years  the fact as discovered afterwards was that the goblins had in working up a second sloping face of stone arrived at a huge block which lay under the cellars of the house within the line of the foundations  it was so round that when they succeeded after hard work in dislodging it without blasting it rolled thundering down the slope with a bounding jarring roll which shook the foundations of the house  the goblins were themselves dismayed at the noise for they knew by careful spying and measuring that they must now be very near if not under the king's house and they feared giving an alarm  they therefore remained quiet for a while and when they began to work again they no doubt thought themselves very fortunate in coming upon a vein of sand which filled a winding fissure in the rock on which the house was built  by scooping this away they came out in the king's wine cellar  no sooner did they find where they were than they scurried back again like rats into their holes and running at full speed to the goblin palace announced their success to the king and queen with shouts of triumph  in a moment the goblin royal family and the whole goblin people were on their way in hot haste to the king's house each eager to have a share in the glory of carrying off that same night the princess irene  the queen went stumping along in one shoe of stone and one of skin  this could not have been pleasant and my readers may wonder that with such skilful workmen about her she had not yet replaced the shoe carried off by curdie  as the king however had more than one ground of objection to her stone shoes he no doubt took advantage of the discovery of her toes and threatened to expose her deformity if she had another made  i presume he insisted on her being content with skin shoes and allowed her to wear the remaining granite one on the present occasion only because she was going out to war  they soon arrived in the king's wine cellar and regardless of its huge vessels of which they did not know the use proceeded at once but as quietly as they could to force the door that led upwards    chapter 27  the goblins in the king's house  when curdie fell asleep he began at once to dream  he thought he was ascending the mountainside from the mouth of the mine whistling and singing 'ring dod bang' when he came upon a woman and child who had lost their way and from that point he went on dreaming everything that had happened to him since he thus met the princess and lootie how he had watched the goblins how he had been taken by them how he had been rescued by the princess everything indeed until he was wounded captured and imprisoned by the men-at-arms  and now he thought he was lying wide awake where they had laid him when suddenly he heard a great thundering sound  'the cobs are coming' he said  'they didn't believe a word i told them  the cobs'll be carrying off the princess from under their stupid noses  but they shan't that they shan't'  he jumped up as he thought and began to dress but to his dismay found that he was still lying in bed  'now then i will' he said  'here goes  i am up now'  but yet again he found himself snug in bed  twenty times he tried and twenty times he failed for in fact he was not awake only dreaming that he was  at length in an agony of despair fancying he heard the goblins all over the house he gave a great cry  then there came as he thought a hand upon the lock of his door  it opened and looking up he saw a lady with white hair carrying a silver box in her hand enter the room  she came to his bed he thought stroked his head and face with cool soft hands took the dressing from his leg rubbed it with something that smelt like roses and then waved her hands over him three times  at the last wave of her hands everything vanished he felt himself sinking into the profoundest slumber and remembered nothing more until he awoke in earnest  the setting moon was throwing a feeble light through the casement and the house was full of uproar  there was soft heavy multitudinous stamping a clashing and clanging of weapons the voices of men and the cries of women mixed with a hideous bellowing which sounded victorious  the cobs were in the house he sprang from his bed hurried on some of his clothes not forgetting his shoes which were armed with nails then spying an old hunting-knife or short sword hanging on the wall he caught it and rushed down the stairs guided by the sounds of strife which grew louder and louder  when he reached the ground floor he found the whole place swarming  all the goblins of the mountain seemed gathered there  he rushed amongst them shouting     'one two   hit and hew   three four   blast and bore'  and with every rhyme he came down a great stamp upon a foot cutting at the same time their faces executing indeed a sword dance of the wildest description  away scattered the goblins in every direction into closets up stairs into chimneys up on rafters and down to the cellars  curdie went on stamping and slashing and singing but saw nothing of the people of the house until he came to the great hall in which the moment he entered it arose a great goblin shout the last of the men-at-arms the captain himself was on the floor buried beneath a wallowing crowd of goblins  for while each knight was busy defending himself as well as he could by stabs in the thick bodies of the goblins for he had soon found their heads all but invulnerable the queen had attacked his legs and feet with her horrible granite shoe and he was soon down but the captain had got his back to the wall and stood out longer  the goblins would have torn them all to pieces but the king had given orders to carry them away alive and over each of them in twelve groups was standing a knot of goblins while as many as could find room were sitting upon their prostrate bodies  curdie burst in dancing and gyrating and stamping and singing like a small incarnate whirlwind    'where 'tis all a hole sir   never can be holes    why should their shoes have soles sir   when they've got no souls    'but she upon her foot sir   has a granite shoe    the strongest leather boot sir   six would soon be through'   the queen gave a howl of rage and dismay and before she recovered her presence of mind curdie having begun with the group nearest him had eleven of the knights on their legs again  'stamp on their feet' he cried as each man rose and in a few minutes the hall was nearly empty the goblins running from it as fast as they could howling and shrieking and limping and cowering every now and then as they ran to cuddle their wounded feet in their hard hands or to protect them from the frightful stamp-stamp of the armed men  and now curdie approached the group which in trusting in the queen and her shoe kept their guard over the prostrate captain  the king sat on the captain's head but the queen stood in front like an infuriated cat with her perpendicular eyes gleaming green and her hair standing half up from her horrid head  her heart was quaking however and she kept moving about her skin-shod foot with nervous apprehension  when curdie was within a few paces she rushed at him made one tremendous stamp at his opposing foot which happily he withdrew in time and caught him round the waist to dash him on the marble floor  but just as she caught him he came down with all the weight of his iron-shod shoe upon her skin-shod foot and with a hideous howl she dropped him squatted on the floor and took her foot in both her hands  meanwhile the rest rushed on the king and the bodyguard sent them flying and lifted the prostrate captain who was all but pressed to death  it was some moments before he recovered breath and consciousness  'where's the princess' cried curdie again and again  no one knew and off they all rushed in search of her  through every room in the house they went but nowhere was she to be found  neither was one of the servants to be seen  but curdie who had kept to the lower part of the house which was now quiet enough began to hear a confused sound as of a distant hubbub and set out to find where it came from  the noise grew as his sharp ears guided him to a stair and so to the wine cellar  it was full of goblins whom the butler was supplying with wine as fast as he could draw it  while the queen and her party had encountered the men-at-arms harelip with another company had gone off to search the house they captured every one they met and when they could find no more they hurried away to carry them safe to the caverns below  but when the butler who was amongst them found that their path lay through the wine cellar he bethought himself of persuading them to taste the wine and as he had hoped they no sooner tasted than they wanted more  the routed goblins on their way below joined them and when curdie entered they were all with outstretched hands in which were vessels of every description from sauce pan to silver cup pressing around the butler who sat at the tap of a huge cask filling and filling  curdie cast one glance around the place before commencing his attack and saw in the farthest corner a terrified group of the domestics unwatched but cowering without courage to attempt their escape  amongst them was the terror-stricken face of lootie but nowhere could he see the princess seized with the horrible conviction that harelip had already carried her off he rushed amongst them unable for wrath to sing any more but stamping and cutting with greater fury than ever  'stamp on their feet stamp on their feet' he shouted and in a moment the goblins were disappearing through the hole in the floor like rats and mice  they could not vanish so fast however but that many more goblin feet had to go limping back over the underground ways of the mountain that morning  presently however they were reinforced from above by the king and his party with the redoubtable queen at their head  finding curdie again busy amongst her unfortunate subjects she rushed at him once more with the rage of despair and this time gave him a bad bruise on the foot then a regular stamping fight got up between them curdie with the point of his hunting-knife keeping her from clasping her mighty arms about him as he watched his opportunity of getting once more a good stamp at her skin-shod foot  but the queen was more wary as well as more agile than hitherto  the rest meantime finding their adversary thus matched for the moment paused in their headlong hurry and turned to the shivering group of women in the corner  as if determined to emulate his father and have a sun-woman of some sort to share his future throne harelip rushed at them caught up lootie and sped with her to the hole  she gave a great shriek and curdie heard her and saw the plight she was in gathering all his strength he gave the queen a sudden cut across the face with his weapon came down as she started back with all his weight on the proper foot and sprung to lootie's rescue  the prince had two defenceless feet and on both of them curdie stamped just as he reached the hole  he dropped his burden and rolled shrieking into the earth  curdie made one stab at him as he disappeared caught hold of the senseless lootie and having dragged her back to the corner there mounted guard over her preparing once more to encounter the queen  her face streaming with blood and her eyes flashing green lightning through it she came on with her mouth open and her teeth grinning like a tiger's followed by the king and her bodyguard of the thickest goblins  but the same moment in rushed the captain and his men and ran at them stamping furiously  they dared not encounter such an onset  away they scurried the queen foremost of course the right thing would have been to take the king and queen prisoners and hold them hostages for the princess but they were so anxious to find her that no one thought of detaining them until it was too late  having thus rescued the servants they set about searching the house once more  none of them could give the least information concerning the princess  lootie was almost silly with terror and although scarcely able to walk would not leave curdie's side for a single moment  again he allowed the others to search the rest of the house where except a dismayed goblin lurking here and there they found no one while he requested lootie to take him to the princess's room  she was as submissive and obedient as if he had been the king  he found the bedclothes tossed about and most of them on the floor while the princess's garments were scattered all over the room which was in the greatest confusion  it was only too evident that the goblins had been there and curdie had no longer any doubt that she had been carried off at the very first of the inroad with a pang of despair he saw how wrong they had been in not securing the king and queen and prince but he determined to find and rescue the princess as she had found and rescued him or meet the worst fate to which the goblins could doom him    chapter 28  curdie's guide  just as the consolation of this resolve dawned upon his mind and he was turning away for the cellar to follow the goblins into their hole something touched his hand  it was the slightest touch and when he looked he could see nothing  feeling and peering about in the grey of the dawn his fingers came upon a tight thread  he looked again and narrowly but still could see nothing  it flashed upon him that this must be the princess's thread  without saying a word for he knew no one would believe him any more than he had believed the princess he followed the thread with his finger contrived to give lootie the slip and was soon out of the house and on the mountainside surprised that if the thread were indeed the grandmother's messenger it should have led the princess as he supposed it must into the mountain where she would be certain to meet the goblins rushing back enraged from their defeat  but he hurried on in the hope of overtaking her first  when he arrived however at the place where the path turned off for the mine he found that the thread did not turn with it but went straight up the mountain  could it be that the thread was leading him home to his mother's cottage  could the princess be there  he bounded up the mountain like one of its own goats and before the sun was up the thread had brought him indeed to his mother's door  there it vanished from his fingers and he could not find it search as he might  the door was on the latch and he entered  there sat his mother by the fire and in her arms lay the princess fast asleep  'hush curdie' said his mother  'do not wake her  i'm so glad you're come  i thought the cobs must have got you again'  with a heart full of delight curdie sat down at a corner of the hearth on a stool opposite his mother's chair and gazed at the princess who slept as peacefully as if she had been in her own bed all at once she opened her eyes and fixed them on him  'oh curdie you're come' she said quietly  'i thought you would'  curdie rose and stood before her with downcast eyes  'irene' he said 'i am very sorry i did not believe you'  'oh never mind curdie' answered the princess  'you couldn't you know  you do believe me now don't you'  'i can't help it now  i ought to have helped it before'  'why can't you help it now'  'because just as i was going into the mountain to look for you i got hold of your thread and it brought me here'  'then you've come from my house have you'  'yes i have'  'i didn't know you were there'  'i've been there two or three days i believe'  'and i never knew it  then perhaps you can tell me why my grandmother has brought me here  i can't think  something woke me i didn't know what but i was frightened and i felt for the thread and there it was  i was more frightened still when it brought me out on the mountain for i thought it was going to take me into it again and i like the outside of it best  i supposed you were in trouble again and i had to get you out  but it brought me here instead and oh curdie your mother has been so kind to me just like my own grandmother'  here curdie's mother gave the princess a hug and the princess turned and gave her a sweet smile and held up her mouth to kiss her  'then you didn't see the cobs'asked curdie  'no i haven't been into the mountain i told you curdie'  'but the cobs have been into your house all over it and into your bedroom making such a row'  'what did they want there  it was very rude of them'  'they wanted you to carry you off into the mountain with them for a wife to their prince harelip'  'oh how dreadful' cried the princess shuddering  'but you needn't be afraid you know  your grandmother takes care of you'  'ah you do believe in my grandmother then  i'm so glad  she made me think you would some day'  all at once curdie remembered his dream and was silent thinking  'but how did you come to be in my house and me not know it' asked the princess  then curdie had to explain everything how he had watched for her sake how he had been wounded and shut up by the soldiers how he heard the noises and could not rise and how the beautiful old lady had come to him and all that followed  'poor curdie to lie there hurt and ill and me never to know it' exclaimed the princess stroking his rough hand  'i would have come and nursed you if they had told me'  'i didn't see you were lame' said his mother  'am i mother  oh yes i suppose i ought to be i declare i've never thought of it since i got up to go down amongst the cobs'  'let me see the wound' said his mother  he pulled down his stocking when behold except a great scar his leg was perfectly sound  curdie and his mother gazed in each other's eyes full of wonder but irene called out   'i thought so curdie  i was sure it wasn't a dream  i was sure my grandmother had been to see you  don't you smell the roses  it was my grandmother healed your leg and sent you to help me'  'no princess irene' said curdie 'i wasn't good enough to be allowed to help you  i didn't believe you  your grandmother took care of you without me'  'she sent you to help my people anyhow  i wish my king-papa would come  i do want so to tell him how good you have been'  'but' said the mother 'we are forgetting how frightened your people must be  you must take the princess home at once curdie or at least go and tell them where she is'  'yes mother  only i'm dreadfully hungry  do let me have some breakfast first  they ought to have listened to me and then they wouldn't have been taken by surprise as they were'  'that is true curdie but it is not for you to blame them much you remember'  'yes mother i do  only i must really have something to eat'  'you shall my boy as fast as i can get it' said his mother rising and setting the princess on her chair  but before his breakfast was ready curdie jumped up so suddenly as to startle both his companions  'mother mother' he cried 'i was forgetting  you must take the princess home yourself  i must go and wake my father'  without a word of explanation he rushed to the place where his father was sleeping  having thoroughly roused him with what he told him he darted out of the cottage    chapter 29  masonwork  he had all at once remembered the resolution of the goblins to carry out their second plan upon the failure of the first  no doubt they were already busy and the mine was therefore in the greatest danger of being flooded and rendered useless not to speak of the lives of the miners  when he reached the mouth of the mine after rousing all the miners within reach he found his father and a good many more just entering they all hurried to the gang by which he had found a way into the goblin country  there the foresight of peter had already collected a great many blocks of stone with cement ready for building up the weak place well enough known to the goblins although there was not room for more than two to be actually building at once they managed by setting all the rest to work in preparing the cement and passing the stones to finish in the course of the day a huge buttress filling the whole gang and supported everywhere by the live rock  before the hour when they usually dropped work they were satisfied the mine was secure  they had heard goblin hammers and pickaxes busy all the time and at length fancied they heard sounds of water they had never heard before but that was otherwise accounted for when they left the mine for they stepped out into a tremendous storm which was raging all over the mountain  the thunder was bellowing and the lightning lancing out of a huge black cloud which lay above it and hung down  its edges of thick mist over its sides  the lightning was breaking out of the mountain too and flashing up into the cloud  from the state of the brooks now swollen into raging torrents it was evident that the storm had been storming all day  the wind was blowing as if it would blow him off the mountain but anxious about his mother and the princess curdie darted up through the thick of the tempest  even if they had not set out before the storm came on he did not judge them safe for in such a storm even their poor little house was in danger  indeed he soon found that but for a huge rock against which it was built and which protected it both from the blasts and the waters it must have been swept if it was not blown away for the two torrents into which this rock parted the rush of water behind it united again in front of the cottage two roaring and dangerous streams which his mother and the princess could not possibly have passed  it was with great difficulty that he forced his way through one of them and up to the door  the moment his hand fell on the latch through all the uproar of winds and waters came the joyous cry of the princess   'there's curdie  curdie  curdie'  she was sitting wrapped in blankets on the bed his mother trying for the hundredth time to light the fire which had been drowned by the rain that came down the chimney  the clay floor was one mass of mud and the whole place looked wretched  but the faces of the mother and the princess shone as if their troubles only made them the merrier  curdie burst out laughing at the sight of them  'i never had such fun' said the princess her eyes twinkling and her pretty teeth shining  'how nice it must be to live in a cottage on the mountain'  'it all depends on what kind your inside house is' said the mother  'i know what you mean' said irene  'that's the kind of thing my grandmother says'  by the time peter returned the storm was nearly over but the streams were so fierce and so swollen that it was not only out of the question for the princess to go down the mountain but most dangerous for peter even or curdie to make the attempt in the gathering darkness  'they will be dreadfully frightened about you' said peter to the princess 'but we cannot help it  we must wait till the morning'  with curdie's help the fire was lighted at last and the mother set about making their supper and after supper they all told the princess stories till she grew sleepy  then curdie's mother laid her in curdie's bed which was in a tiny little garret-room  as soon as she was in bed through a little window low down in the roof she caught sight of her grandmother's lamp shining far away beneath and she gazed at the beautiful silvery globe until she fell asleep    chapter 30  the king and the kiss  the next morning the sun rose so bright that irene said the rain had washed his face and let the light out clean  the torrents were still roaring down the side of the mountain but they were so much smaller as not to be dangerous in the daylight  after an early breakfast peter went to his work and curdie and his mother set out to take the princess home  they had difficulty in getting her dry across the streams and curdie had again and again to carry her but at last they got safe on the broader part of the road and walked gently down towards the king's house  and what should they see as they turned the last corner but the last of the king's troop riding through the gate  'oh curdie' cried irene clapping her hands right joyfully'my king-papa is come'  the moment curdie heard that he caught her up in his arms and set off at full speed crying   'come on mother dear  the king may break his heart before he knows that she is safe'  irene clung round his neck and he ran with her like a deer  when he entered the gate into the court there sat the king on his horse with all the people of the house about him weeping and hanging their heads the king was not weeping but his face was white as a dead man's and he looked as if the life had gone out of him  the men-at-arms he had brought with him sat with horror-stricken faces but eyes flashing with rage waiting only for the word of the king to do something they did not know what and nobody knew what  the day before the men-at-arms belonging to the house as soon as they were satisfied the princess had been carried away rushed after the goblins into the hole but found that they had already so skilfully blockaded the narrowest part not many feet below the cellar that without miners and their tools they could do nothing not one of them knew where the mouth of the mine lay and some of those who had set out to find it had been overtaken by the storm and had not even yet returned  poor sir walter was especially filled with shame and almost hoped the king would order his head to be cut off for to think of that sweet little face down amongst the goblins was unendurable  when curdie ran in at the gate with the princess in his arms they were all so absorbed in their own misery and awed by the king's presence and grief that no one observed his arrival  he went straight up to the king where he sat on his horse  'papa papa' the princess cried stretching out her arms to him 'here i am'  the king started  the colour rushed to his face  he gave an inarticulate cry  curdie held up the princess and the king bent down and took her from his arms  as he clasped her to his bosom the big tears went dropping down his cheeks and his beard  and such a shout arose from all the bystanders that the startled horses pranced and capered and the armour rang and clattered and the rocks of the mountain echoed back the noises  the princess greeted them all as she nestled in her father's bosom and the king did not set her down until she had told them all the story  but she had more to tell about curdie than about herself and what she did tell about herself none of them could understand except the king and curdie who stood by the king's knee stroking the neck of the great white horse  and still as she told what curdie had done sir walter and others added to what she told even lootie joining in the praises of his courage and energy  curdie held his peace looking quietly up in the king's face  and his mother stood on the outskirts of the crowd listening with delight for her son's deeds were pleasant in her ears until the princess caught sight of her  'and there is his mother king-papa' she said  'see there  she is such a nice mother and has been so kind to me'  they all parted asunder as the king made a sign to her to come forward she obeyed and he gave her his hand but could not speak  'and now king-papa' the princess went on 'i must tell you another thing  one night long ago curdie drove the goblins away and brought lootie and me safe from the mountain  and i promised him a kiss when we got home but lootie wouldn't let me give it him  i don't want you to scold lootie but i want you to tell her that a princess must do as she promises'  'indeed she must my child except it be wrong' said the king 'there give curdie a kiss'  and as he spoke he held her towards him  the princess reached down threw her arms round curdie's neck and kissed him on the mouth saying  'there curdie  there's the kiss i promised you'  then they all went into the house and the cook rushed to the kitchen and the servants to their work  lootie dressed irene in her shiningest clothes and the king put off his armour and put on purple and gold and a messenger was sent for peter and all the miners and there was a great and a grand feast which continued long after the princess was put to bed    chapter 31  the subterranean waters  the king's harper who always formed a part of his escort was chanting a ballad which he made as he went on playing on his instrument about the princess and the goblins and the prowess of curdie when all at once he ceased with his eyes on one of the doors of the hall thereupon the eyes of the king and his guests turned thitherward also the next moment through the open doorway came the princess irene  she went straight up to her father with her right hand stretched out a little sideways and her forefinger as her father and curdie understood feeling its way along the invisible thread  the king took her on his knee and she said in his ear   'king-papa do you hear that noise'  'i hear nothing' said the king  'listen' she said holding up her forefinger  the king listened and a great stillness fell upon the company each man seeing that the king listened listened also and the harper sat with his harp between his arms and his finger silent upon the strings  'i do hear a noise' said the king at length 'a noise as of distant thunder  it is coming nearer and nearer  what can it be'  they all heard it now and each seemed ready to start to his feet as he listened  yet all sat perfectly still  the noise came rapidly nearer  'what can it be' said the king again  'i think it must be another storm coming over the mountain' said sir walter  then curdie who at the first word of the king had slipped from his seat and laid his ear to the ground rose up quickly and approaching the king said speaking very fast   'please your majesty i think i know what it is  i have no time to explain for that might make it too late for some of us  will your majesty give orders that everybody leave the house as quickly as possible and get up the mountain'  the king who was the wisest man in the kingdom knew well there was a time when things must be done and questions left till afterwards  he had faith in curdie and rose instantly with irene in his arms 'every man and woman follow me' he said and strode out into the darkness  before he had reached the gate the noise had grown to a great thundering roar and the ground trembled beneath their feet and before the last of them had crossed the court out after them from the great hall door came a huge rush of turbid water and almost swept them away but they got safe out of the gate and up the mountain while the torrent went roaring down the road into the valley beneath  curdie had left the king and the princess to look after his mother whom he and his father one on each side caught up when the stream overtook them and carried safe and dry  when the king had got out of the way of the water a little up the mountain he stood with the princess in his arms looking back with amazement on the issuing torrent which glimmered fierce and foamy through the night  there curdie rejoined them  'now curdie' said the king 'what does it mean  is this what you expected'  'it is your majesty' said curdie and proceeded to tell him about the second scheme of the goblins who fancying the miners of more importance to the upper world than they were had resolved if they should fail in carrying off the king's daughter to flood the mine and drown the miners  then he explained what the miners had done to prevent it  the goblins had in pursuance of their design let loose all the underground reservoirs and streams expecting the water to run down into the mine which was lower than their part of the mountain for they had as they supposed not knowing of the solid wall close behind broken a passage through into it  but the readiest outlet the water could find had turned out to be the tunnel they had made to the king's house the possibility of which catastrophe had not occurred to the young miner until he had laid his ear to the floor of the hall  what was then to be done  the house appeared in danger of falling and every moment the torrent was increasing  'we must set out at once' said the king  'but how to get at the horses'  'shall i see if we can manage that' said curdie  'do' said the king  curdie gathered the men-at-arms and took them over the garden wall and so to the stables  they found their horses in terror the water was rising fast around them and it was quite time they were got out but there was no way to get them out except by riding them through the stream which was now pouring from the lower windows as well as the door  as one horse was quite enough for any man to manage through such a torrent curdie got on the king's white charger and leading the way brought them all in safety to the rising ground  'look look curdie' cried irene the moment that having dismounted he led the horse up to the king  curdie did look and saw high in the air somewhere about the top of the king's house a great globe of light shining like the purest silver  'oh' he cried in some consternation 'that is your grandmother's lamp we must get her out  i will go an find her  the house may fall you know'  'my grandmother is in no danger' said irene smiling  'here curdie take the princess while i get on my horse' said the king  curdie took the princess again and both turned their eyes to the globe of light  the same moment there shot from it a white bird which descending with outstretched wings made one circle round the king an curdie and the princess and then glided up again  the light and the pigeon vanished together  'now curdie' said the princess as he lifted her to her father's arms 'you see my grandmother knows all about it and isn't frightened i believe she could walk through that water and it wouldn't wet her a bit'  'but my child' said the king 'you will be cold if you haven't something more on  run curdie my boy and fetch anything you can lay your hands on to keep the princess warm  we have a long ride before us'  curdie was gone in a moment and soon returned with a great rich fur and the news that dead goblins were tossing about in the current through the house  they had been caught in their own snare instead of the mine they had flooded their own country whence they were now swept up drowned  irene shuddered but the king held her close to his bosom then he turned to sir walter and said   'bring curdie's father and mother here'  'i wish' said the king when they stood before him 'to take your son with me  he shall enter my bodyguard at once and wait further promotion'  peter and his wife overcome only murmured almost inaudible thanks but curdie spoke aloud  'please your majesty' he said 'i cannot leave my father and mother'  'that's right curdie' cried the princess  'i wouldn't if i was you'  the king looked at the princess and then at curdie with a glow of satisfaction on his countenance  'i too think you are right curdie' he said 'and i will not ask you again  but i shall have a chance of doing something for you some time'  'your majesty has already allowed me to serve you' said curdie  'but curdie' said his mother 'why shouldn't you go with the king we can get on very well without you'  'but i can't get on very well without you' said curdie  'the king is very kind but i could not be half the use to him that i am to you please your majesty if you wouldn't mind giving my mother a red petticoat  i should have got her one long ago but for the goblins'  'as soon as we get home' said the king 'irene and i will search out the warmest one to be found and send it by one of the gentlemen'  'yes that we will curdie' said the princess  'and next summer we'll come back and see you wear it curdie's mother' she added 'shan't we king-papa'  'yes my love i hope so' said the king  then turning to the miners he said   'will you do the best you can for my servants tonight  i hope they will be able to return to the house tomorrow'  the miners with one voice promised their hospitality then the king commanded his servants to mind whatever curdie should say to them and after shaking hands with him and his father and mother the king and the princess and all their company rode away down the side of the new stream which had already devoured half the road into the starry night    chapter 32  the last chapter  all the rest went up the mountain and separated in groups to the homes of the miners  curdie and his father and mother took lootie with them and the whole way a light of which all but lootie understood the origin shone upon their path  but when they looked round they could see nothing of the silvery globe  for days and days the water continued to rush from the doors and windows of the king's house and a few goblin bodies were swept out into the road  curdie saw that something must be done  he spoke to his father and the rest of the miners and they at once proceeded to make another outlet for the waters  by setting all hands to the work tunnelling here and building there they soon succeeded and having also made a little tunnel to drain the water away from under the king's house they were soon able to get into the wine cellar where they found a multitude of dead goblins among the rest the queen with the skin-shoe gone and the stone one fast to her ankle for the water had swept away the barricade which prevented the men-at-arms from following the goblins and had greatly widened the passage  they built it securely up and then went back to their labours in the mine  a good many of the goblins with their creatures escaped from the inundation out upon the mountain  but most of them soon left that part of the country and most of those who remained grew milder in character and indeed became very much like the scotch brownies their skulls became softer as well as their hearts and their feet grew harder and by degrees they became friendly with the inhabitants of the mountain and even with the miners  but the latter were merciless to any of the cobs' creatures that came in their way until at length they all but disappeared  the rest of the history of the princess and curdie must be kept for another volume,The Princess and the Goblin,George MacDonald
